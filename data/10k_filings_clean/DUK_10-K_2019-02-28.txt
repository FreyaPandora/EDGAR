and other total the number of residential and general service customer within the electric utility and infrastructure service territory is expected to increase over time economic condition within the service territory remain strong sale growth continues to be influenced by adoption of energy efficiency and self generation residential sale for compared to saw relatively strong growth despite the impact from increasing amount of energy efficiency however the continued adoption of more efficient housing and appliance is expected to have negative impact on average usage per residential customer over time seasonality and the impact of weatherrevenues and cost are influenced by seasonal weather pattern peak sale of electricity occur during the summer and winter month which result in higher revenue and cash flow during these period by contrast lower sale of electricity occur during the spring and fall allowing for scheduled plant maintenance residential and general service customer are more impacted by weather than industrial customer estimated weather impact are based on actual current period weather compared to normal weather condition normal weather condition are defined the long term average of actual historical weather condition the estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the temperature variance from normal condition and customer historic usage pattern the methodology used to estimate the impact of weather not consider all variable that may impact customer response to weather condition such humidity in the summer or wind chill in the winter the precision of this estimate may also be impacted by applying long term weather trend to shorter term period heating degree day measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature fall below base temperature cooling degree day measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature rise the base temperature each degree of temperature below the base temperature count one heating degree day and each degree of temperature above the base temperature count one cooling degree day competitionretailelectric utility and infrastructure business operate the sole supplier of electricity within their service territory with the exception of ohio which ha competitive electricity supply market for generation service electric utility and infrastructure owns and operates facility necessary to transmit distribute and generate electricity service are priced by state commission approved rate designed to include the cost of providing these service and reasonable return on invested capital this regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable electricity at fair price in ohio electric utility and infrastructure conduct competitive auction for electricity supply the cost of energy purchased through these auction is recovered from retail customer electric utility and infrastructure earns retail margin in ohio on the transmission and distribution of electricity but not on the cost of the underlying energy competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the development and deployment of alternative energy source including on site generation from industrial customer and distributed generation such private solar at residential general service and or industrial customer site wholesaleduke energy competes with other utility and merchant generator for bulk power sale sale to municipality and cooperative and wholesale transaction primarily cost based contract approved by ferc the principal factor in competing for these sale are availability of capacity and power reliability of service and price price are influenced primarily by market condition and fuel cost increased competition in the wholesale electric utility industry and the availability of transmission access could affect electric utility and infrastructure load forecast plan for power supply and wholesale energy sale and related revenue wholesale energy sale will be impacted by the extent to which additional generation is available to sell to the wholesale market and the ability of electric utility and

distribution operation compete with other company that supply energy primarily electric company propane and fuel oil dealer renewable energy provider and coal company in relation to source of energy for electric power plant well nuclear energy significant competitive factor is price gas utility and infrastructure primary product competition is with electricity for heating water heating and cooking increase in the price of natural gas or decrease in the price of other energy source could negatively impact competitive position by decreasing the price benefit of natural gas to the consumer in the case of industrial customer such manufacturing plant adverse economic or market condition including higher natural gas cost could cause these customer to suspend business operation or to use alternative source of energy in favor of energy source with lower per unit cost higher natural gas cost or decrease in the price of other energy source may allow competition from alternative energy source for application that have traditionally used natural gas encouraging customer to move away from natural gas fired equipment to equipment fueled by other energy source competition between natural gas and other form of energy is also based on efficiency performance reliability safety and other non price factor technological improvement in other energy source and event that impair the public perception of the non price attribute of natural gas could erode our competitive advantage these factor in turn could decrease the demand for natural gas impair our ability to attract new customer and cause existing customer to switch to other form of energy or to bypass our system in favor of alternative competitive source this could result in slow or no customer growth and could

the north american electric reliability corporation regulation affect almost every aspect of the duke energy registrant business including among other thing their ability to take fundamental business management action determine the term and rate of transmission and distribution service make acquisition issue equity or debt security engage in transaction with other subsidiary and affiliate and pay dividend upstream to the duke energy registrant change to federal regulation are continuous and ongoing there can be no assurance that law regulation and policy will not be changed in way that result in material modification of business model and objective or affect return on investment by restricting activity and product subjecting to escalating cost causing delay or prohibiting them outright factor the duke energy registrant are subject to numerous environmental law and regulation requiring significant capital expenditure that can increase the cost of operation and which may impact or limit business plan or cause exposure to environmental liability the duke energy registrant are subject to numerous environmental law and regulation affecting many aspect of their present and future operation including ccrs air emission water quality wastewater discharge solid waste and hazardous waste these law and regulation can result in increased capital operating and other cost these law and regulation generally require the duke energy registrant to obtain and comply with wide variety of environmental license permit inspection and other approval compliance with environmental law and regulation can require significant expenditure including expenditure for cleanup cost and damage arising from contaminated property failure to comply with environmental regulation may result in the imposition of fine penalty and injunctive measure affecting operating asset the step the duke energy registrant could be required to take to ensure their facility are in compliance could be prohibitively expensive result the duke energy registrant may be required to shut down or alter the operation of their facility which may cause the duke energy registrant to incur loss further the duke energy registrant may not be successful in recovering capital and operating cost incurred to comply with new environmental regulation through existing regulatory rate structure and their contract with customer also the duke energy registrant may not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approval for their operating asset or development project delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval failure to obtain and comply with them or change in environmental law or regulation to more stringent compliance level could result in additional cost of operation for existing facility or development of new facility being prevented delayed or subject to additional cost although it is not expected that the cost to comply with current environmental regulation will have material adverse effect on the duke energy registrant result of operation financial position and cash flow due to regulatory cost recovery the duke energy registrant are at risk that the cost of complying with environmental regulation in the future will have such an effect the epa ha enacted or proposed federal regulation governing the management of cooling water intake structure wastewater and emission these regulation may require the duke energy registrant to make additional capital expenditure and increase operating and maintenance cost duke energy carolina and duke energy progress are subject to the term of probation set out in judgment of the united state district court for the eastern district of north carolina on may the judgment are based on event and activity that took place prior to the term of probation require the company to comply with certain environmental regulatory obligation related to coal ash and subject the two company to oversight by court appointed monitor if duke energy carolina or duke energy progress failed to comply with certain coal ash related environmental law and regulation or otherwise violated the term of probation it could result in the imposition of additional penalty including the revocation of probation and prosecution of the underlying violation although it is not expected that the company will violate the term of probation or that additional material penalty would occur significant violation of probation could have material adverse effect on the duke energy registrant reputation result of operation financial position and cash flow the duke energy registrant operation capital expenditure and financial result may be affected by regulatory change related to the impact of global climate change there is continued concern both nationally and internationally about climate change the epa and state regulator may adopt and implement regulation to restrict emission of ghgs to address global climate change increased regulation of ghg emission could impose significant additional cost on the duke energy registrant operation their supplier and customer regulatory change could also result in generation facility to be retired early and result in stranded cost if duke energy is not able to fully recover the cost and investment in generation operational risksthe duke energy registrant result of operation may be negatively affected by overall market economic and other condition that are beyond their control sustained downturn or sluggishness in the economy generally affect the market in which the duke energy registrant operate and negatively influence operation decline in demand for electricity or natural gas result of economic downturn in the duke energy registrant regulated service territory will reduce overall sale and lessen cash flow especially industrial customer reduce production and therefore consumption of electricity and the use of natural gas although the duke energy registrant regulated electric and natural gas business are subject to regulated allowable rate of return and recovery of certain cost such fuel and purchased natural gas cost under periodic adjustment clause overall decline in electricity or natural gas sold result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenue and cash flow thereby diminishing result of operation additionally prolonged economic downturn that negatively impact the duke energy registrant result of operation and cash flow could result in future material impairment charge to write down the carrying value of certain asset including goodwill to their respective fair value the duke energy registrant also sell electricity into the spot market or other competitive power market on contractual basis with respect to such transaction the duke energy registrant are not guaranteed any rate of return on their capital investment through mandated rate and revenue and result of operation are likely to depend in large part upon prevailing market price these market price may fluctuate substantially over relatively short period of time and could reduce the duke energy registrant revenue and margin thereby diminishing result of operation factor that could impact sale volume generation of electricity and market price at which the duke energy registrant are able to sell electricity and natural gas are follows weather condition including abnormally mild winter or summer weather that cause lower energy or natural gas usage for heating or cooling purpose applicable and period of low rainfall that decrease the ability to operate facility in an economical manner supply of and demand for energy commodity transmission or transportation constraint or inefficiency that impact nonregulated energy operation factor availability of competitively priced alternative energy source which are preferred by some customer over electricity produced from coal nuclear or natural gas plant and customer usage of energy efficient equipment that reduces energy demand natural gas crude oil and refined product production level and price ability to procure satisfactory level of inventory such coal natural gas and uranium and capacity and transmission service into or out of the duke energy registrant market natural disaster or operational accident may adversely affect the duke energy registrant operating result natural disaster or other operational accident within the company or industry such forest fire earthquake hurricane or natural gas transmission pipeline explosion could have direct or indirect impact to the duke energy registrant or to key contractor and supplier further the generation of electricity and the transportation and storage of natural gas involve inherent operating risk that may result in accident involving serious injury or loss of life environmental damage or property damage such event could impact the duke energy registrant through change to policy law and regulation whose compliance cost have significant impact on the duke energy registrant result of operation financial position and cash flow in addition if serious operational accident were to occur it could have material adverse effect on the result of operation financial position cash flow and reputation of the duke energy registrant the reputation and financial condition of the duke energy registrant could be negatively impacted due to their obligation to comply with federal and state regulation law and other legal requirement that govern the operation assessment storage closure remediation disposal and monitoring relating to ccr the high cost and new rate impact associated with implementing these new ccr related requirement and the strategy and method necessary to implement these requirement in compliance with these legal obligation result of electricity produced for decade at coal fired power plant the duke energy registrant manage large amount of ccr that are primarily stored in dry storage within landfill or combined with water in other surface impoundment all in compliance with applicable regulatory requirement however the potential exists for another ccr related incident such the one that occurred during the dan river steam station ash basin release that could raise environmental or public health concern such ccr related incident could have material adverse impact on the reputation and result of operation financial position and cash flow of the duke energy registrant during epa regulation were enacted related to the management of ccr from power plant these regulation classify ccr nonhazardous waste under the rcra and apply to electric generating site with new and existing landfill new and existing surface impoundment structural fill and ccr pile and establishes requirement regarding landfill design structural integrity design and assessment criterion for surface impoundment groundwater monitoring protection and remedial procedure and other operational and reporting procedure for the disposal and management of ccr in addition to the federal regulation ccr landfill and surface impoundment will continue to be independently regulated by existing state law regulation and permit well additional legal requirement that may be imposed in the future these federal and state law regulation and other legal requirement may require or result in additional expenditure increased operating and maintenance cost and or result in closure of certain power generating facility which could affect the result of operation financial position and cash flow of the duke energy registrant the duke energy registrant will continue to seek full cost recovery for expenditure through the normal ratemaking process with state and federal utility commission who permit recovery in rate of necessary and prudently incurred cost associated with the duke energy registrant regulated operation and through other wholesale contract with term that contemplate recovery of such cost although there is no guarantee of full cost recovery in addition the timing for recovery of such cost could have material adverse impact on duke energy cash flow the duke energy registrant have recognized significant asset retirement obligation related to these ccr related requirement closure activity began in at the four site specified high priority by the coal ash act and at the lee steam station site in south carolina in connection with other legal requirement excavation at these site involves movement of large amount of ccr material to off site location for use structural fill to appropriate engineered off site or on site lined landfill or conversion of the ash for beneficial use at other site preliminary planning and closure method have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management cost the coal ash act requires ccr surface impoundment in north carolina to be closed with the closure method and timing based on risk ranking classification determined by legislation or state regulator additionally the rcra required closure timing depends upon meeting or continuing to meet certain criterion the closure and ccr management work progress and final closure plan and corrective action measure are developed and approved at each site the scope and complexity of work and the amount of ccr material could be greater than estimate and could therefore materially increase compliance expenditure and rate impact the duke energy registrant financial position result of operation and cash flow may be negatively affected by lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customer or decline in customer demand or number of customer growth in customer account and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and natural gas and the need for additional power generation and delivery facility customer growth and customer usage are affected by number of factor outside the control of the duke energy registrant such mandated energy efficiency measure demand side management goal distributed generation resource and economic and demographic condition such population change job and income growth housing start new business formation and the overall level of economic activity certain regulatory and legislative body have introduced or are considering requirement and or incentive to reduce energy consumption by certain date additionally technological advance driven by federal law mandating new level of energy efficiency in end use electric device or other improvement in or application of technology could lead to decline in per caput energy consumption advance in distributed generation technology that produce power including fuel cell microturbines wind turbine and solar cell may reduce the cost of alternative method of producing power to level competitive with central power station electric production utilized by the duke energy registrant factor some or all of these factor could result in lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customer and may cause the failure of the duke energy registrant to fully realize anticipated benefit from significant capital investment and expenditure which could have material adverse effect on their result of operation financial position and cash flow furthermore the duke energy registrant currently have energy efficiency rider in place to recover the cost of energy efficiency program in north carolina south carolina florida indiana ohio and kentucky should the duke energy registrant be required to invest in conservation measure that result in reduced sale from effective conservation regulatory lag in adjusting rate for the impact of these measure could have negative financial impact the duke energy registrant operating result may fluctuate on seasonal and quarterly basis and can be negatively affected by change in weather condition and severe weather including extreme weather condition associated with climate change electric power generation and natural gas distribution are generally seasonal business in most part of the the demand for power peak during the warmer summer month with market price also typically peaking at that time in other area demand for power peak during the winter demand for natural gas peak during the winter month further extreme weather condition such hurricane drought heat wave winter storm and severe weather associated with climate change could cause these seasonal fluctuation to be more pronounced result the overall operating result of the duke energy registrant business may fluctuate substantially on seasonal and quarterly basis and thus make period to period comparison le relevant sustained severe drought condition could impact generation by hydroelectric plant well fossil and nuclear plant operation these facility use water for cooling purpose and for the operation of environmental compliance equipment furthermore destruction caused by severe weather event such hurricane tornado severe thunderstorm snow and ice storm can result in lost operating revenue due to outage property damage including downed transmission and distribution line and additional and unexpected expense to mitigate storm damage the cost of storm restoration effort may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process the duke energy registrant sale may decrease if they are unable to gain adequate reliable and affordable access to transmission asset the duke energy registrant depend on transmission and distribution facility owned and operated by utility and other energy company to deliver electricity sold to the wholesale market the ferc power transmission regulation require wholesale electric transmission service to be offered on an open access non discriminatory basis if transmission is disrupted or if transmission capacity is inadequate the duke energy registrant ability to sell and deliver product may be hindered the different regional power market have changing regulatory structure which could affect growth and performance in these region in addition the isos who oversee the transmission system in regional power market have imposed in the past and may impose in the future price limitation and other mechanism to address volatility in the power market these type of price limitation and other mechanism may adversely impact the profitability of the duke energy registrant wholesale power marketing business duke energy may be unable to complete necessary or desirable pipeline expansion or infrastructure development or maintenance project which may prevent the duke energy registrant from expanding the natural gas business in order to serve current or new natural gas customer or expand the service to existing customer the duke energy registrant need to maintain expand or upgrade distribution transmission and or storage infrastructure including laying new pipeline and building compressor station duke energy registrant have made significant investment in number of pipeline development project which are being operated and constructed by third party joint venture partner the duke energy registrant must rely on their third party joint venture partner for proper construction management of the project and are dependent upon contractor for the successful and timely completion of the project in addition various factor such the inability to obtain required approval from local state and or federal regulatory and governmental body public opposition to project adverse litigation ruling inability to obtain adequate financing competition for labor and material construction delay cost overrun and the inability to negotiate acceptable agreement relating to right of way construction or other material development component may prevent or delay the completion of project or materially increase the cost of such project which could have material adverse effect on the result of operation and financial position of duke energy the availability of adequate interstate pipeline transportation capacity and natural gas supply may decrease the duke energy registrant purchase almost all of their natural gas supply from interstate source that must be transported to the applicable service territory interstate pipeline company transport the natural gas to the duke energy registrant system under firm service agreement that are designed to meet the requirement of their core market significant disruption to interstate pipeline capacity or reduction in natural gas supply due to event including but not limited to operational failure or disruption hurricane tornado flood freeze off of natural gas well terrorist or cyberattacks or other act of war or legislative or regulatory action or requirement including remediation related to integrity inspection could reduce the normal interstate supply of natural gas and thereby reduce earnings moreover if additional natural gas infrastructure including but not limited to exploration and drilling rig and platform processing and gathering system off shore pipeline interstate pipeline and storage can not be built at pace that meet demand then growth opportunity could be limited and earnings negatively impacted fluctuation in commodity price or availability may adversely affect various aspect of the duke energy registrant operation well their financial position result of operation and cash flow the duke energy registrant are exposed to the effect of market fluctuation in the price of natural gas coal fuel oil nuclear fuel electricity and other energy related commodity result of their ownership of energy related asset fuel cost are recovered primarily through cost recovery clause subject to the approval of state utility commission factor additionally the duke energy registrant are exposed to risk that counterparties will not be able to fulfill their obligation disruption in the delivery of fuel including disruption result of among other thing transportation delay weather labor relation force majeure event or environmental regulation affecting any of these fuel supplier could limit the duke energy registrant ability to operate their facility should counterparties fail to perform the duke energy registrant might be forced to replace the underlying commitment at prevailing market price possibly resulting in loss in addition to the amount if any already paid to the counterparties certain of the duke energy registrant hedge agreement may result in the receipt of or posting of collateral with counterparties depending on the daily market based calculation of financial exposure of the derivative position fluctuation in commodity price that lead to the return of collateral received and or the posting of collateral with counterparties could negatively impact liquidity downgrade in the duke energy registrant credit rating could lead to additional collateral posting requirement the duke energy registrant continually monitor derivative position in relation to market price activity potential terrorist activity or military or other action could adversely affect the duke energy registrant business the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the and it ally may lead to increased political economic and financial market instability and volatility in price for natural gas and oil which may have material adverse effect in way the duke energy registrant can not predict at this time in addition future act of terrorism and possible reprisal consequence of action by the and it ally could be directed company operating in the information technology system transmission and distribution and generation facility such nuclear plant could be potential target of terrorist activity or harmful activity by individual or group that could have material adverse effect on duke energy registrant business in particular the duke energy registrant may experience increased capital and operating cost to implement increased security for their information technology system transmission and distribution and generation facility including nuclear power plant under the nrc design basis threat requirement these increased cost could include additional physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following terrorist incident the failure of duke energy information technology system or the failure to enhance existing information technology system and implement new technology could adversely affect the

operational excellence initiative of the critical nature of the infrastructure increased connectivity to the internet and technology system inherent vulnerability to disability or failure due to hacking virus act of war or terrorism or other type of data security breach the duke energy registrant face heightened risk of cyberattack from foreign or domestic source and have been subject and will likely continue to be subject to attempt to gain unauthorized access to information and or information system or to disrupt utility operation through computer virus and phishing attempt either directly or indirectly through it material vendor or related third party in the event of significant cybersecurity breach on either the duke energy registrant or with one of our material vendor or related third party the duke energy registrant could have business operation disrupted including the disruption of the operation of our asset and the power grid theft of confidential company employee shareholder vendor or customer information and general business system and process interruption or compromise including preventing the duke energy registrant from servicing customer collecting revenue or the recording processing and or reporting financial information correctly ii experience substantial loss of revenue repair and restoration cost penalty and cost for lack of compliance with relevant regulation implementation cost for additional security measure to avert future cyberattacks and other financial loss and iii be subject to increased regulation litigation and reputational damage while duke energy maintains insurance relating to cybersecurity event such insurance is subject to number of exclusion and may be insufficient to offset any loss cost or damage experienced also the market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and coverage available for cybersecurity event may evolve the industry matures the duke energy registrant are subject to standard enacted by the north american electric reliability corporation and enforced by ferc regarding protection of the physical and cyber security of critical infrastructure asset required for operating north america bulk electric system the duke energy registrant are also subject to regulation set by the nuclear regulatory commission regarding the protection of digital computer and communication system and network required for the operation of nuclear power plant while the duke energy registrant believe they are in compliance with such standard and regulation the duke energy registrant have from time to time been and may in the future be found to be in violation of such standard and regulation in addition compliance with or change in the applicable standard and regulation may subject the duke energy registrant to higher operating cost and or increased capital expenditure well substantial fine for non compliance failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could unfavorably impact the duke energy registrant result of operation certain event such an aging workforce mismatch of skill set or complement to future need or unavailability of contract resource may lead to operating challenge and increased cost the challenge include lack of resource loss of knowledge base and the lengthy time required for skill development in this case cost including cost for contractor to replace employee productivity cost and safety cost may increase failure to hire and adequately train replacement employee including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employee or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business especially considering the workforce need associated with nuclear generation facility and new skill required to operate modernized technology enabled power grid if the duke energy registrant are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce their result of operation financial position and cash flow could be negatively affected the cost of decommissioning duke energy florida crystal river unit could prove to be more extensive than is currently identified cost to decommission the plant could exceed estimate and if not recoverable through the regulatory process could adversely affect duke energy progress energy and duke energy florida result of operation financial position and cash flow duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana membership in an rto present risk that could have material adverse effect on their

energy indiana may be allocated portion of the cost of transmission facility built by others due to change in rto transmission rate design duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana may be required to expand their transmission system according to decision made by an rto rather than their own internal planning process in addition rtos have been developing rule associated with the allocation and methodology of assigning cost associated with improved transmission reliability reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission right that may have financial impact on the result of operation financial position and cash flow of duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana member of an rto duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana are subject to certain additional risk including those associated with the allocation among rto member of loss caused by unreimbursed default of other participant in the rto market and those associated with complaint case filed against an rto that may seek refund of revenue previously earned by rto member factor the duke energy registrant may not recover cost incurred to begin construction on project that are canceled duke energy long term strategy requires the construction of new project either wholly owned or partially owned which involve number of risk including construction delay nonperformance by equipment and other third party supplier and increase in equipment and labor cost to limit the risk of these construction project the duke energy registrant enter into equipment purchase order and construction contract and incur engineering and design service cost in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approval and or siting or environmental permit if any of these project are canceled for any reason including failure to receive necessary regulatory approval and or siting or environmental permit significant cancellation penalty under the equipment purchase order and construction contract could occur in addition if any construction work or investment have been recorded an asset an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled nuclear generation risksduke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida may incur substantial cost and liability due to their ownership and operation of nuclear generating facility ownership interest in and operation of nuclear station by duke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida subject them to various risk these risk include among other thing the potential harmful effect on the environment and human health resulting from the current or past operation of nuclear facility and the storage handling and disposal of radioactive material limitation on the amount and type of insurance commercially available to cover loss that might arise in connection with nuclear operation and uncertainty with respect to the technological and financial aspect of decommissioning nuclear plant at the end of their licensed life ownership and operation of nuclear generation facility requires compliance with licensing and safety related requirement imposed by the nrc in the event of non compliance the nrc may increase regulatory oversight impose fine or shut down unit depending upon it assessment of the severity of the situation revised security and safety requirement promulgated by the nrc which could be prompted by among other thing event within or outside of the control of duke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida such serious nuclear incident at facility owned by third party could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditure well assessment to cover third party loss in addition if serious nuclear incident were to occur it could have material adverse effect on the result of operation financial position cash flow and reputation of the duke energy registrant liquidity capital requirement and common stock risksthe duke energy registrant rely on access to short term borrowing and longer term debt and equity market to finance their capital requirement and support their liquidity need access to those market can be adversely affected by number of condition many of which are beyond the duke energy registrant control the duke energy registrant business are significantly financed through issuance of debt and equity the maturity and repayment profile of debt used to finance investment often doe not correlate to cash flow from their asset accordingly source of liquidity for capital requirement not satisfied by the cash flow from their operation and to fund investment originally financed through debt instrument with disparate maturity the duke energy registrant rely on access to short term money market well longer term capital market the subsidiary registrant also rely on access to short term intercompany borrowing if the duke energy registrant are not able to access debt or equity at competitive rate or at all the ability to finance their operation and implement their strategy and business plan scheduled could be adversely affected an inability to access debt and equity may limit the duke energy registrant ability to pursue improvement or acquisition that they may otherwise rely on for future growth market disruption may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial market such disruption could include economic downturn the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company unfavorable capital market condition market price for electricity and natural gas actual or threatened terrorist attack or the overall health of the energy industry the availability of credit under duke energy master credit facility depends upon the ability of the bank providing commitment under the facility to provide fund when their obligation to do so arise systematic risk of the banking system and the financial market could prevent bank from meeting it obligation under the facility agreement duke energy maintains revolving credit facility to provide backup for it commercial paper program and letter of credit to support variable rate demand tax exempt bond that may be put to the duke energy registrant issuer at the option of the holder the facility includes borrowing sublimits for the duke energy registrant each of whom is party to the credit facility and financial covenant that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding percentage of the total capital for the specific entity failure to maintain these covenant at particular entity could preclude duke energy from issuing commercial paper or the duke energy registrant from issuing letter of credit or borrowing under the master credit facility the duke energy registrant must meet credit quality standard and there is no assurance they will maintain investment grade credit rating if the duke energy registrant are unable to maintain investment grade credit rating they would be required under credit agreement to provide collateral in the form of letter of credit or cash which may materially adversely affect their liquidity each of the duke energy registrant senior long term debt issuance is currently rated investment grade by various rating agency the duke energy registrant can not ensure their senior long term debt will be rated investment grade in the future if the rating agency were to rate the duke energy registrant below investment grade borrowing cost would increase perhaps significantly in addition the potential pool of investor and funding source would likely decrease further if the short term debt rating were to fall access to the commercial paper market could be significantly limited factor downgrade below investment grade could also require the posting of additional collateral in the form of letter of credit or cash under various credit commodity and capacity agreement and trigger termination clause in some interest rate derivative agreement which would require cash payment all of these event would likely reduce the duke energy registrant liquidity and profitability and could have material effect on their result of operation financial position and cash flow non compliance with debt covenant or condition could adversely affect the duke energy registrant ability to execute future borrowing the duke energy registrant debt and credit agreement contain various financial and other covenant failure to meet those covenant beyond applicable grace period could result in accelerated due date and or termination of the agreement market performance and other change may decrease the value of the ndtf investment of duke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida which then could require significant additional funding ownership and operation of nuclear generation facility also requires the maintenance of funded trust that are intended to pay for the decommissioning cost of the respective nuclear power plant the performance of the capital market affect the value of the asset held in trust to satisfy these future obligation duke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida have significant obligation in this area and hold significant asset in these trust these asset are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain return which may fall below projected rate of return although number of factor impact funding requirement decline in the market value of the asset may increase the funding requirement of the obligation for decommissioning nuclear plant if duke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida are unable to successfully manage their ndtf asset their result of operation financial position and cash flow could be negatively affected poor investment performance of the duke energy pension plan holding and other factor impacting pension plan cost could unfavorably impact the duke energy registrant liquidity and result of operation the cost of providing non contributory defined benefit pension plan are dependent upon number of factor such the rate of return on plan asset discount rate the level of interest rate used to measure the required minimum funding level of the plan future government regulation and required or voluntary contribution made to the plan the subsidiary registrant are allocated their proportionate share of the cost and obligation related to these plan without sustained growth in the pension investment over time to increase the value of plan asset and depending upon the other factor impacting cost listed above duke energy could be required to fund it plan with significant amount of cash such cash funding obligation and the subsidiary registrant proportionate share of such cash funding obligation could have material impact on the duke energy registrant result of operation financial position and cash flow duke energy is holding company and depends on the cash flow from it subsidiary to meet it financial obligation because duke energy is holding company with no operation or cash flow of it own it ability to meet it financial obligation including making interest and principal payment on outstanding indebtedness and to pay dividend on it common stock is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flow of it subsidiary and the ability of those subsidiary to pay upstream dividend or to repay borrowed fund prior to funding duke energy it subsidiary have regulatory restriction and financial obligation that must be satisfied these subsidiary are separate legal entity and have no obligation to provide duke energy with fund in addition duke energy may provide

the decrease in the effective tax rate wa primarily due to the lower statutory federal corporate tax rate under the tax act matter impacting future resultswithin this item see the tax act section above well liquidity and capital resource below for discussion of risk associated with the tax act critical accounting policy and estimatespreparation of financial statement requires the application of accounting policy judgment assumption and estimate that can significantly affect the reported result of operation cash flow or the amount of asset and liability recognized in the financial statement judgment made include the likelihood of success of particular project possible legal and regulatory challenge earnings assumption on pension and other benefit fund investment and anticipated recovery of cost especially through regulated operation management discus these policy estimate and assumption with senior member of management on regular basis and provides periodic update on management decision to the audit committee management belief the area described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimate and assumption that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent period for further information see note to the consolidated financial statement summary of significant accounting policy regulated operation accountingsubstantially all of duke energy regulated operation meet the criterion for application of regulated operation accounting treatment result duke energy is required to record asset and liability that would not be recorded for nonregulated entity regulatory asset generally represent incurred cost that have been deferred because such cost are probable of future recovery in customer rate regulatory liability are recorded when it is probable that regulator will require duke energy to make refund to customer or reduce rate to customer for previous collection or deferred revenue for cost that have yet to be incurred management continually ass whether recorded regulatory asset are probable of future recovery by considering factor such applicable regulatory environment change historical regulatory treatment for similar cost in duke energy jurisdiction litigation of rate order recent rate order to other regulated entity level of actual return on equity compared to approved rate of return on equity and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation if future recovery of cost cease to be probable asset write offs would be recognized in operating income additionally regulatory agency can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property plant and equipment recognition of asset retirement cost and amortization of regulatory asset or may disallow recovery of all or portion of certain asset required by regulated operation accounting rule significant judgment can be required to determine if an otherwise recognizable incurred cost qualifies to be deferred for future recovery regulatory asset significant judgment can also be required to determine if revenue previously recognized are for entity specific cost that are no longer expected to be incurred or have not yet been incurred and are therefore regulatory liability acritical accounting policy and estimatesgoodwill impairment assessmentsduke energy performed it annual goodwill impairment test for all reporting unit of august and all of the reporting unit estimated fair value of equity substantially exceeded the carrying value of equity except for the commercial renewables reporting unit which recorded impairment charge of million the fair value of the reporting unit were calculated using weighted combination of the income approach which estimate fair value based on discounted cash flow and the market approach which estimate fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industry estimated future cash flow under the income approach are based on duke energy internal business plan significant assumption used are growth rate future rate of return expected to result from ongoing rate regulation and discount rate management determines the appropriate discount rate for each of it reporting unit based on the wacc for each individual reporting unit the wacc take into account both the after tax cost of debt and cost of equity major component of the cost of equity is the current risk free rate on year treasury bond in the impairment test duke energy considered implied waccs for certain peer company in determining the appropriate wacc rate to use in it analysis each reporting unit ha different risk profile based on the nature of it operation including factor such regulation the wacc for each reporting unit may differ accordingly the waccs were adjusted appropriate to account for company specific risk premium the discount rate used for calculating the fair value of august for each of duke energy reporting unit ranged from percent to percent the underlying assumption and estimate are made of point in time subsequent change particularly change in the discount rate authorized regulated rate of return or growth rate inherent in management estimate of future cash flow could result in future impairment charge one of the most significant assumption utilized in determining the fair value of reporting unit under the market approach is implied market multiple for certain peer company management selects comparable peer based on each peer primary business mix operation and market capitalization compared to the applicable reporting unit and calculates implied market multiple based on available projected earnings guidance and peer company market value of august duke energy primarily operates in environment that are rate regulated in such environment revenue requirement are adjusted periodically by regulator based on factor including level of cost sale volume and cost of capital accordingly duke energy regulated utility operate to some degree with buffer from the direct effect positive or negative of significant swing in market or economic condition however significant change in discount rate over prolonged period may have material impact on the fair value of equity for further information see note to the consolidated financial statement goodwill and intangible asset asset retirement obligationsaros are recognized for legal obligation associated with the retirement of property plant and equipment at the present value of the projected liability in the period in which it is incurred if reasonable estimate of fair value can be made the present value of the initial obligation and subsequent update are based on discounted cash flow which include estimate regarding timing of future cash flow selection of discount rate and cost escalation rate among other factor these estimate are subject to change obligation for nuclear decommissioning are based on site specific cost study duke energy carolina and duke energy progress assume prompt dismantlement of the nuclear facility after operation are ceased duke energy florida assumes crystal river unit will be placed into safe storage configuration until eventual dismantlement is completed by duke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida also assume that spent fuel will be stored on site until such time that it can be transferred to yet to be built doe facility obligation for closure of ash basin are based upon discounted cash flow of estimated cost for site specific plan if known or probability weighting of the potential closure method if the closure plan are under development and multiple closure option are being considered and evaluated on site by site basis for further information see note to the consolidated financial statement asset retirement obligation long lived asset impairment assessment excluding regulated operationsduke energy evaluates property plant and equipment for impairment when event or change in circumstance such significant change in cash flow projection or the determination that it is more likely than not that an asset or asset group will be sold indicate the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable the determination of whether an impairment ha occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flow attributable to the asset compared with their carrying value performing an impairment evaluation involves significant degree of estimation and judgment in area such identifying circumstance that indicate an impairment may exist identifying and grouping affected asset and developing the undiscounted future cash flow if an impairment ha occurred the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value and recording loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value additionally determining fair value requires probability weighting future cash flow to reflect expectation about possible variation in their amount or timing and the selection of an appropriate discount rate although cash flow estimate are based on relevant information available at the time the estimate are made estimate of future cash flow are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual result when determining whether an asset or asset group ha been impaired management group asset at the lowest level that ha discrete cash flow for further information see note to the consolidated financial statement property plant and equipment acritical accounting policy and estimatesequity method investmentsequity method investment are assessed for impairment when condition exist that indicate that the fair value of the investment is le than book value if the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary an impairment charge is recorded and the investment is written down to it estimated fair value which establishes new cost basis in the investment event or change in circumstance are monitored that may indicate in management judgment the carrying value of such investment may have experienced an other than temporary decline in value the fair value of equity method investment is generally estimated using an income approach where significant judgment and assumption include expected future cash flow the appropriate discount rate and probability weighted scenario if applicable in certain instance market approach may also be used to estimate the fair value of the equity method investment event or change in circumstance that may be indicative of an other than temporary decline in value will vary by investment but may include significant delay in or failure to complete significant growth project of investees adverse regulatory action expected to substantially reduce the investee product demand or profitability expected financial performance significantly worse than anticipated when initially invested prolonged period the fair value is below carrying value significant or sustained decline in the market value of an investee lower than expected cash distribution from investees significant asset impairment or operating loss recognized by investees and loss of significant customer or supplier with no immediate prospect for replacement acpas of december the carrying value of the equity method investment in acp is billion and duke energy maximum exposure to loss for it guarantee of the acp revolving credit facility is billion during the fourth quarter of acp received several adverse court ruling described in note to the consolidated financial statement regulatory matter result duke energy evaluated this investment for impairment and determined that fair value approximated carrying value and therefore no impairment wa necessary duke energy estimated the fair value of it investment in acp using an income approach that primarily considered probability weighted scenario of discounted future net cash flow based on the most recent estimate of total construction cost and revenue these scenario included assumption of various court decision and the impact those decision may have on the timing and extent of investment including scenario assuming the full resolution of permitting issue in addition to scenario where the project doe not proceed most of the scenario reflect phased in service date assumption certain scenario within the analysis also included growth expectation from additional compression or other expansion opportunity and reopeners for pricing discount rate of percent wa used in the analysis higher probability were generally assigned to those scenario where court approval were received and the project move forward under reasonable timeline reflecting interim rate and either current contracted pricing provision or price subject to the reopeners low probability wa assigned to the scenario where the project doe not proceed judgment and assumption are inherent in our estimate of future cash flow discount rate growth assumption and the likelihood of various scenario it is reasonably possible that future unfavorable development such reduced likelihood of success with court approval increased estimate of construction cost material increase in the discount rate important feedback on customer price increase or further significant delay could result in future impairment the use of alternate judgment and assumption could result in different calculation of fair value which could ultimately result in the recognition of an impairment charge in the consolidated financial statement for further information see note to the consolidated financial statement investment in unconsolidated affiliate pension and other post retirement benefitsthe calculation of pension expense other post retirement benefit expense and net pension and other post retirement asset or liability require the use of assumption and election of permissible accounting alternative change in assumption can result in different expense and reported asset or liability amount and future actual experience can differ from the assumption duke energy belief the most critical assumption for pension and other post retirement benefit are the expected long term rate of return on plan asset the assumed discount rate applied to future projected benefit payment and the heath care cost trend rate duke energy elect to amortize net actuarial gain or loss amount that are in excess of percent of the greater of the market related value of plan asset or the plan projected benefit obligation into net pension or other post retirement benefit expense over the average remaining service period of active participant expected to benefit under the plan if all or almost all of plan participant are inactive the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participant is used instead of average remaining service period prior service cost or credit which represents an increase or decrease in plan pension benefit obligation resulting from plan amendment is amortized on straight line basis over the average expected remaining service period of active participant expected to benefit under the plan if all or almost all of plan participant are inactive the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participant is used instead of average remaining service period acritical accounting policy and estimatesas of december duke energy assumes pension and other post retirement plan asset will generate long term rate of return of percent the expected long term rate of return wa developed using weighted average calculation of expected return based primarily on future expected return across asset class considering the use of active asset manager where applicable the asset allocation target were set after considering the investment objective and the risk profile equity security are held for their higher expected return debt security are primarily held to hedge the qualified pension liability real asset return seeking fixed income hedge fund and other global security are held for diversification investment within asset class are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual manager on investment duke energy discounted it future pension and other post retirement obligation using rate of percent of december discount rate used to measure benefit plan obligation for financial reporting purpose reflect rate at which pension benefit could be effectively settled of december duke energy determined it discount rate for pension and other post retirement obligation using bond selection settlement portfolio approach this approach develops discount rate by selecting portfolio of high quality corporate bond that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected benefit payment of the plan the selected bond portfolio is derived from universe of non callable corporate bond rated aa quality or higher after the bond portfolio is selected single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan projected benefit payment discounted at this rate with the market value of the bond selected future change in plan asset return assumed discount rate and various other factor related to the participant in duke energy pension and post retirement plan will impact future pension expense and liability duke energy can not predict with certainty what these factor will be in the future the following table present the approximate effect on duke energy pretax pension expense pretax other post retirement

cashduke energy relies primarily upon cash flow from operation debt and equity issuance and it existing cash and cash equivalent to fund it liquidity and capital requirement duke energy capital requirement arise primarily from capital and investment expenditure repaying long term debt and paying dividend to shareholder among other provision the tax act lower the corporate federal income tax rate from to percent and eliminates bonus depreciation for regulated utility for duke energy regulated operation the reduction in federal income tax is expected to result in lower regulated customer rate however due to it existing nol position and other tax credit duke energy doe not expect to be significant federal cash tax payer through at least result any reduction in customer rate could cause material reduction in consolidated cash flow from operation in the short term over time the reduction in deferred tax liability resulting from the tax act will increase duke energy regulated rate base investment and customer rate impact of tax act to duke energy cash flow and credit metric are subject to the regulatory action of it state commission and the ferc see note to the consolidated financial statement regulatory matter for additional information the subsidiary registrant generally maintain minimal cash balance and use short term borrowing to meet their working capital need and other cash requirement the subsidiary registrant excluding progress energy parent support their short term borrowing need through participation with duke energy and certain of it other subsidiary in

facility for additional discussion of the money pool arrangement aliquidity and capital resourcesduke energy and the subsidiary registrant excluding progress energy parent may also use short term debt including commercial paper and the money pool bridge to long term debt financing the level of borrowing may vary significantly over the course of the year due to the timing of long term debt financing and the impact of fluctuation in cash flow from operation from time to time duke energy current liability exceed current asset resulting from the use of short term debt funding source to meet

there is no assurance to the amount of future dividend because they depend on future earnings capital requirement financial condition and are subject to the discretion of the board of director duke energy target dividend payout ratio of between and percent based upon adjusted diluted eps and expects this trend to continue through in and duke energy increased the dividend by approximately percent annually and the company remains committed to continued growth of the dividend dividend and other funding restriction of duke energy subsidiariesas discussed in note to the consolidated financial

result of condition imposed by various regulator in conjunction with merger transaction duke energy progress and duke energy florida also have restriction imposed by their first mortgage bond indenture and article of incorporation which in certain circumstance limit their ability to make cash dividend or distribution on common stock additionally certain other duke energy subsidiary have other restriction such minimum working capital and tangible net worth requirement pursuant to debt and other agreement that limit the amount of fund that can be transferred to duke energy at december the amount of restricted net asset of wholly owned subsidiary of duke energy that may not be distributed to duke energy in the form of loan or dividend doe not exceed material amount of duke energy net asset duke energy doe not have any legal or other restriction on paying common stock dividend to shareholder out of it consolidated equity account although these restriction cap the amount of

associated with these market fluctuation which may include using various commodity derivative such swap future forward and option for additional information see note to the consolidated financial statement derivative and hedging the input and methodology used to determine the fair value of contract are validated by an internal group separate from duke energy deal origination function while duke energy us common industry practice to develop it valuation technique change in it pricing methodology or the underlying assumption could result in significantly different fair value and income recognition hedging strategiesduke energy closely monitor risk associated with commodity price change on it future operation and where appropriate us various commodity instrument such electricity coal and natural gas forward contract and option to mitigate the effect of such fluctuation on operation duke energy primary use of energy commodity derivative is to hedge against exposure to the price of power fuel for generation and natural gas for customer the majority of instrument used to manage duke energy commodity price exposure are either not designated hedge or do not qualify for hedge accounting these instrument are referred to undesignated contract mark to market change for undesignated contract entered into by regulated business are reflected regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet undesignated contract entered into by unregulated business are marked to market each period with change in the fair value of the derivative instrument reflected in earnings duke energy may also enter into other contract that qualify for the npns exception when contract meet the criterion to qualify npns duke energy applies such exception income recognition and realization related to npns contract generally coincide with the physical delivery of the commodity for contract qualifying for the npns exception no recognition of the contract fair value in the

portfolio risk the duke energy registrant optimize the value of their generation portfolio which include generation asset fuel and emission allowance modeled forecast of future generation output and fuel requirement are based on forward power and fuel market the component piece of the portfolio are bought and sold based on model and forecast of generation in order to manage the economic value of the portfolio in accordance with the strategy of the business unit for the electric utility and infrastructure segment the generation portfolio not utilized to serve retail operation or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuation however the impact on the consolidated statement of operation is partially offset by mechanism in these regulated jurisdiction that result in the sharing of net profit from these activity with retail customer interest rate riskduke energy is exposed to risk resulting from change in interest rate result of it issuance or anticipated issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper duke energy manages interest rate exposure by limiting variable rate exposure to percentage of total debt and by monitoring the effect of market change in interest rate duke energy also enters into financial derivative instrument which may include instrument such but not limited to interest rate swap swaptions and treasury lock agreement to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure see note and to the consolidated financial statement summary of significant accounting policy debt and credit facility derivative and hedging and fair value measurement at december duke energy had billion of treasury lock agreement million notional amount of floating to fixed swap outstanding million notional amount of fixed to floating swap outstanding

global climate changethe duke energy registrant ghg emission consist primarily of and result primarily from operating fleet of coal fired and natural gas fired power plant in the duke energy registrant power plant emitted approximately million ton of future level of emission will be influenced by variable that include fuel price compliance with new or existing regulation economic condition that affect electricity demand and the technology deployed to generate the electricity necessary to meet the customer demand the duke energy registrant have taken action that have resulted in reduction of emission over time action have included the retirement of coal fired egus with combined generating capacity of mw much of that capacity ha been replaced with state of the art highly efficient natural gas fired generation that produce far fewer emission per unit of electricity generated duke energy also ha made investment to expand it portfolio of wind and solar project increase energy efficiency offering and invest in it zero emission hydropower and nuclear plant these effort have diversified it system and significantly reduced emission between and the duke energy registrant have collectively lowered the emission from their electricity generation by percent which potentially lower the exposure to any future mandatory emission reduction requirement or carbon tax whether result of federal legislation epa regulation state regulation or other yet unknown emission reduction requirement duke energy will continue to explore the use of currently available and commercially demonstrated technology to reduce emission including energy efficiency wind solar storage and nuclear duke energy will adjust to evolving and innovative technology in way that balance the reliability and affordability that customer expect under any future scenario involving mandatory limitation the duke energy registrant would plan to seek recovery of their compliance cost through appropriate regulatory mechanism the duke energy registrant recognize certain group associate severe weather event with increasing level of ghgs in the atmosphere and forecast the possibility these weather event could have material impact on future result of operation should they occur more frequently and with greater severity however the uncertain nature of potential change in extreme weather event such increased frequency duration and severity the long period of time over which any potential change might take place and the inability to predict potential change with any degree of accuracy make estimating any potential future financial risk to the duke energy registrant operation impossible the duke energy registrant annually biannually or triennially prepare lengthy forward looking irps

renewables energy storage energy efficiency and demand response initiative the irp process also help evaluate potential environmental and regulatory scenario to better mitigate policy and economic risk the irps we file with regulator look out to year depending on the jurisdiction for number of year the duke energy registrant have included price on emission in their irp planning process to account for the potential regulation of emission incorporating price on emission in the irps allows for the evaluation of existing and future resource need against potential climate change policy risk in the absence of policy certainty one of the challenge with using price especially in the absence of clear and certain policy is determining the appropriate price to use to address this uncertainty and ensure the company remains agile the duke energy registrant typically use range of potential price to reflect range of potential policy outcome the duke energy registrant routinely take step to reduce the potential impact of severe weather event on their electric distribution system by modernizing the electric grid through smart meter storm hardening self healing and targeted undergrounding and applying lesson learned from previous storm to restoration effort the duke energy registrant electric generating facility are designed to withstand extreme weather event without significant damage the duke energy registrant maintain an inventory of coal and oil on site to mitigate the effect of any potential short term disruption in fuel supply so they can continue to provide customer with an

new accounting standardsthe new accounting standard adopted for and had no material impact on the presentation or result of operation cash flow or financial position of the duke energy registrant the following accounting standard were adopted by the duke energy registrant during revenue from contract with customer in may the fasb issued revised accounting guidance for revenue recognition from contract with customer the core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised good or service to customer in an amount that reflects the consideration expected in exchange for those good or service the amendment also required disclosure of sufficient information to allow user to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flow arising from contract with customer the majority of duke energy revenue is in scope of the new guidance other revenue arrangement such alternative revenue program and certain ppas and lighting agreement accounted for lease are excluded from the scope of this guidance and therefore are accounted for and evaluated for separate presentation and disclosure under other relevant accounting guidance duke energy elected the modified retrospective method of adoption effective january under the modified retrospective method of adoption prior year reported result are not restated adoption of this standard did not result in material change in the timing or pattern of revenue recognition and cumulative effect adjustment wa not recorded at january duke energy utilized certain practical expedient including applying this guidance to open contract at the date of adoption expensing cost to obtain contract where the amortization period of the asset would have been one year or le ignoring the effect of significant financing when the period between transfer of the good or service and payment is one year or le and recognizing revenue for certain contract under the invoice practical expedient which allows revenue recognition to be consistent with invoiced amount including unbilled estimate provided certain criterion are met including consideration of whether the invoiced amount reasonably represent the value provided to customer in preparation for adoption duke energy identified material revenue stream and reviewed representative contract and tariff including those associated with certain long term customer contract such wholesale contract ppas and other customer arrangement duke energy also monitored the activity of the power and utility industry revenue recognition task force and ha reviewed published position on specific industry issue to evaluate the impact if any on duke energy specific contract and conclusion duke energy applied the available practical expedient to portfolio of tariff and contract with similar characteristic the vast majority of sale including energy provided to retail customer are from tariff offering that provide natural gas or electricity without defined contractual term at will in most circumstance revenue from contract with customer is equivalent to the electricity or natural gas supplied and billed in that period including unbilled estimate such adoption of the new rule did not result in shift in the timing or pattern of revenue recognition for such sale while there have been change to the caption and description of revenue in duke energy financial statement the most significant impact result of adopting the standard are additional disclosure around the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flow arising from contract with customer see note for further information statementssummary of significant accounting policiesfinancial instrument classification and measurement on january duke energy adopted fasb guidance which revised the classification and measurement of certain financial instrument the adopted guidance change the presentation of realized and unrealized gain and loss in certain equity security that were previously recorded in aoci these gain and loss are recorded in net income an entity equity investment that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting are not included within the scope of the new guidance this guidance had minimal impact on the duke energy registrant consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income change in the fair value of most of the duke energy registrant equity security are deferred regulatory asset or liability pursuant to accounting guidance for regulated operation the resulting adjustment of unrealized gain and loss in aoci to retained earnings wa immaterial the primary impact to duke energy result of implementing this guidance is adding disclosure requirement to present separately the financial asset and financial liability by measurement category and form of financial asset see note and for further information statement of cash flow in november the fasb issued revised accounting guidance to reduce diversity in practice for the presentation and classification of restricted cash on the consolidated statement of cash flow under the updated guidance restricted cash and restricted cash equivalent are included within beginning of period and end of period cash and cash equivalent on the consolidated statement of cash flow duke energy adopted this guidance on january the guidance ha been applied using retrospective transition method to each period presented the adoption by duke energy of the revised guidance resulted in change to the amount of cash cash equivalent and restricted cash explained when reconciling the beginning of period and end of period total amount shown on the consolidated statement of cash flow in addition reconciliation ha been provided of cash cash equivalent and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheet that sum to the total of the same such amount in the consolidated statement of cash flow prior to adoption the duke energy registrant reflected change in noncurrent restricted cash within cash flow from investing activity and change in current restricted cash within cash flow from operating activity on the consolidated statement of cash flow in august the fasb issued accounting guidance addressing diversity in practice for eight separate cash flow issue the guidance requires entity to classify distribution received from equity method investees using either the cumulative earnings approach or the nature of the distribution approach duke energy adopted this guidance on january and elected the nature of distribution approach this approach requires all distribution received to be categorized based on legal documentation describing the nature of the activity generating the distribution cash inflow resulting in return on investment surplus will be reflected in cash flow from operating activity on the consolidated statement of cash flow whereas cash inflow resulting in return of investment capital will be reflected in cash flow from investing activity on the consolidated statement of cash flow the guidance ha been applied using the retrospective transition method to each period presented there are no change to the consolidated statement of cash flow for the period presented result of this accounting change retirement benefit in march the fasb issued revised accounting guidance for the presentation of net periodic cost related to benefit plan previous guidance required the aggregation of all the component of net periodic cost on the consolidated statement of operation and did not require the disclosure of the location of net periodic cost on the consolidated statement of operation under the amended guidance the service cost component of net periodic cost is included within operating income within the same line other compensation expense all other component of net periodic cost are outside of operating income in addition the updated guidance permit only the service cost component of net periodic cost to be capitalized to inventory or property plant and equipment this represents change from previous guidance which permitted all component of net periodic cost to be eligible for capitalization duke energy adopted this guidance on january under previous guidance duke energy presented the total non capitalized net periodic cost within operation maintenance and other on the consolidated statement of operation the adoption of this guidance resulted in retrospective change to reclassify the presentation of the non service cost benefit component of net periodic cost to other income and expense duke energy utilized the practical expedient for retrospective presentation the change in component of net periodic cost eligible for capitalization is applicable prospectively since duke energy service cost component is greater than the total net periodic cost the change result in increased capitalization of net periodic cost higher operation maintenance and other and higher other income and expense the resulting prospective impact to duke energy is an immaterial increase in net income see note for further information for duke energy the retrospective change resulted in higher operation maintenance and other and higher other income and expense net of million and million for the year ended december and respectively there wa no change to net income for these prior period the following new accounting standard have been issued but have not yet been adopted by the duke energy registrant of december lease in february the fasb issued

measurement date the fair value definition focus on an exit price versus the acquisition cost fair value measurement use market data or assumption market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumption about risk and the risk inherent in the input to the valuation technique these input may be readily observable corroborated by market data or generally unobservable valuation technique maximize the use of observable input and minimize use of unobservable input midmarket pricing convention the midpoint price between bid and ask price is permitted for use practical expedient fair value measurement are classified in three level based on the fair value hierarchy defined by gaap certain investment are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy these investment are measured at fair value using the nav per share practical expedient the nav is derived based on the investment cost le any impairment plus or minus change resulting from observable price change for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer statementsfair value measurementsfair value accounting guidance permit entity to elect to measure certain financial instrument that are not required to be accounted for at fair value such equity method investment or the company own debt at fair value the duke energy registrant have not elected to record any of these item at fair value transfer between level represent asset or liability that were previously categorized at higher level for which the input to the estimate became le observable or ii classified at lower level for which the input became more observable during the period the duke energy registrant policy is to recognize transfer between level of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the period there were no transfer between level during the year ended december and in addition for piedmont there were no transfer between level during the two month ended december and the year ended october valuation method of the primary fair value measurement disclosed below are follows investment in equity securitiesthe majority of investment in equity security are valued using level measurement investment in equity security are typically valued at the closing price in the principal active market of the last business day of the quarter principal active market for equity price include published exchange such the nyse and the nasdaq stock market foreign equity price are translated from their trading currency using the currency exchange rate in effect at the close of the principal active market there wa no after hour market activity that wa required to be reflected in the reported fair value measurement investment in debt securitiesmost investment in debt security are valued using level measurement because the valuation use interest rate curve and credit spread applied to the term of the debt instrument maturity and coupon interest rate and consider the counterparty credit rating if the market for particular fixed income security is relatively inactive or illiquid the measurement is level commodity derivativescommodity derivative with clearinghouses are classified level other commodity derivative including piedmont natural gas supply contract are primarily valued using internally developed discounted cash flow model that incorporate forward price adjustment for liquidity bid ask spread and credit or non performance risk after reflecting credit enhancement such collateral and are discounted to present value pricing input are derived from published exchange transaction price and other observable data source in the absence of an active market the last available price may be used if forward price curve are not observable for the full term of the contract and the unobservable period had more than an insignificant impact on the valuation the commodity derivative is classified level in isolation increase decrease in natural gas forward price result in favorable unfavorable fair value adjustment for natural gas purchase contract and increase decrease in electricity forward price result in unfavorable favorable fair value adjustment for electricity sale contract duke energy regularly evaluates and validates pricing input used to estimate the fair value of natural gas commodity contract by market participant price verification procedure this procedure provides comparison of internal forward commodity curve to market participant generated curve interest rate derivativesmost over the counter interest rate contract derivative are valued using

interest in addition certain proposed environmental rulemaking could result in future increased ovec cost allocation see note for additional information crcsee discussion under consolidated vies for additional information related to crc amount included in receivables from affiliated company in the above table for duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana reflect their retained interest in receivables sold to crc these subordinated note held by duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana are stated at fair value carrying value of retained interest are determined by allocating carrying value of the receivables between asset sold and interest retained based on relative fair value the allocated base of the subordinated note are not materially different than their face value because the receivables generally turnover in le than two month ii credit loss are reasonably predictable due to the broad customer base and lack of significant concentration and iii the equity in crc is subordinate to all retained interest and thus would absorb loss first the hypothetical effect on fair value of the retained interest assuming both percent and percent unfavorable variation in credit loss or discount rate is not material due to the short turnover of receivables and historically low credit loss history interest accrues to duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana on the retained interest using the acceptable yield method this method generally approximates the stated rate on the note since the allocated basis and the face value are nearly equivalent an impairment charge is recorded against the carrying value of both retained interest and purchased beneficial interest whenever it is determined that an otti ha occurred statementsvariable interest entitieskey assumption used in estimating fair value are detailed in the following table duke energy ohio duke energy indiana credit loss discount receivable turnover the following table show the gross and net receivables sold duke energy ohio duke energy indiana in million sold retained receivables sold following table show sale and cash flow related to receivables sold duke energy ohio duke energy indiana year ended

from operating activity on duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana consolidated statement of cash flow collection fee received in connection with servicing transferred account receivable are included in operation maintenance and other on duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income the loss recognized on sale of receivables is calculated monthly by multiplying receivables sold during the month by the required discount the required discount is derived monthly utilizing three year weighted average formula that considers charge off history late charge history and turnover history on the sold receivables well component for the time value of money the discount rate or component for the time value of money is the prior month end libor plus fixed rate of percent revenueas described in note duke energy adopted revenue from contract with customer effective january using the modified retrospective method of adoption which doe not require restatement of prior year reported result no cumulative effect adjustment wa recorded the vast majority of duke energy revenue are at will and without defined contractual term additionally comparative disclosure for operating result with the previous revenue recognition rule are not applicable duke energy revenue recognition ha not materially changed result of the new standard duke energy recognizes revenue consistent with amount billed under tariff offering or at contractually agreed upon rate based on actual physical delivery of electric or natural gas service including estimated volume delivered when billing have not yet occurred such the majority of duke energy revenue have fixed pricing based on the contractual term of the published tariff with variability in expected cash flow attributable to the customer volumetric demand and ultimate quantity of energy or natural gas supplied and used during the billing period the stand alone selling price of related sale are designed to support recovery of prudently incurred cost and an appropriate return on invested asset and are primarily governed by published tariff rate or contractual agreement approved by relevant regulatory body described in note certain excise tax and franchise fee levied by state or local government are required to be paid even if not collected from the customer these tax are recognized on gross basis part of revenue duke energy elect to account for all other tax net of revenue performance obligation are satisfied over time energy or natural gas is delivered and consumed with billing generally occurring monthly and related payment due within day depending on regulatory requirement in no event doe the timing between payment and delivery of the good and service exceed one year using this output method for revenue recognition provides faithful depiction of the transfer of electric and natural gas service customer obtain control of the commodity and benefit from it use at delivery additionally duke energy ha an enforceable right to consideration for energy or natural gas delivered at any discrete point in time and will recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which duke energy is entitled for the energy or natural gas delivered statementsrevenueas described above the majority of duke energy tariff revenue are at will and such related contract with customer have an expected duration of one year or le and will not have future performance obligation for disclosure additionally other long term revenue stream including wholesale contract generally provide service that are part of single performance obligation the delivery of electricity or natural gas such other than material fixed consideration under long term contract related disclosure for future performance obligation are also not applicable duke energy earns substantially all of it revenue through it reportable segment electric utility and infrastructure gas utility and infrastructure and commercial renewables electric utility and infrastructureelectric utility and infrastructure earns the majority of it revenue through retail and wholesale electric service through the generation transmission distribution and sale of electricity duke energy generally provides retail and wholesale electric service customer with their full electric load requirement or with supplemental load requirement when the customer ha other source of electricity retail electric service is generally marketed throughout duke energy electric service territory through standard service offer the standard service offer are through tariff determined by regulator in duke energy regulated service territory each tariff which is assigned to customer based on customer class ha multiple component such an energy charge demand charge basic facility charge and applicable rider duke energy considers each of these component to be aggregated into single performance obligation for providing electric service or in the case of distribution only customer in duke energy ohio for delivering electricity electricity is considered single performance obligation satisfied over time consistent with the series guidance and is provided and consumed over the billing period generally one month retail electric service is typically provided to at will customer who can cancel service at any time without substantive penalty additionally duke energy adheres to applicable regulatory requirement in each jurisdiction to ensure the collectability of amount billed and appropriate mitigating procedure are followed when necessary such revenue from contract with customer for such contract is equivalent to the electricity supplied and billed in that period including unbilled estimate wholesale electric service is generally provided under long term contract using cost based pricing ferc regulates cost that may be recovered from customer and the amount of return company are permitted to earn wholesale contract include both energy and demand charge for full requirement contract duke energy considers both charge single performance obligation for providing integrated electric service for contract where energy and demand charge are considered separate performance obligation energy and demand are each distinct performance obligation under the series guidance and are satisfied energy is delivered and stand ready service is provided on monthly basis this service represents consumption over the billing period and revenue is recognized consistent with billing and unbilled estimate which generally occur monthly contractual amount owed are typically trued up annually based upon incurred cost in accordance with ferc published filing and the specific customer actual peak demand estimate of variable consideration related to potential additional billing or refund owed are updated quarterly the majority of wholesale revenue are full requirement contract where the customer purchase the substantial majority of their energy need and do not have fixed quantity of contractually required energy or capacity such related forecasted revenue are considered optional purchase supplemental requirement contract that include contracted block of energy and capacity at contractually fixed price have the following estimated remaining

with invoiced amount and unbilled estimate gas utility and infrastructuregas utility and infrastructure earns it revenue through retail and wholesale natural gas service through the transportation distribution and sale of natural gas duke energy generally provides retail and wholesale natural gas service customer with all natural gas load requirement additionally while natural gas can be stored substantially all natural gas provided by duke energy is consumed by customer simultaneously with receipt of delivery retail natural gas service is marketed throughout duke energy natural gas service territory using published tariff rate the tariff rate are established by regulator in duke energy service territory each tariff which is assigned to customer based on customer class have multiple component such commodity charge demand charge customer or monthly charge and transportation cost duke energy considers each of these component to be aggregated into single performance obligation for providing natural gas service for contract where duke energy provides all of the customer natural gas need the delivery of natural gas is considered single performance obligation satisfied over time and revenue is recognized monthly based on billing and unbilled estimate service is provided and the commodity is consumed over the billing period additionally natural gas service is typically at will and customer can cancel service at any time without substantive penalty duke energy also adheres to applicable regulatory requirement to ensure the collectability of amount billed and receivable and appropriate mitigating procedure are followed when necessary statementsrevenuecertain long term individually negotiated contract exist to provide natural gas service these contract are regulated and approved by state commission the negotiated contract have multiple component including natural gas and demand charge similar to retail natural gas contract duke energy considers each of these component to be single performance obligation for providing natural gas service this service represents consumption over the billing period generally one month fixed capacity payment under long term contract for the gas utility and infrastructure segment include minimum margin contract and supply arrangement with municipality and power generation facility revenue for related sale are recognized monthly natural gas is delivered and stand ready service is provided consistent with invoiced amount and unbilled estimate estimated remaining performance obligation are follows remaining performance obligation in million renewablescommercial renewables earns the majority of it revenue through long term ppas and generally sell all of it wind and solar facility output electricity and recs to customer the majority of these ppas have historically been accounted for lease for ppas that are not accounted for lease the delivery of electricity and the delivery of recs are considered separate performance obligation the delivery of electricity is performance obligation satisfied over time and represents generation and consumption of the electricity over the billing period generally one month the delivery of recs is performance obligation satisfied at point in time and represents delivery of each rec generated by the wind or solar facility the majority of self generated recs are bundled with energy in duke energy contract and such related revenue are recognized energy is generated and delivered that pattern is consistent with duke energy performance commercial renewables recognizes revenue based on the energy generated and billed for the period generally one month at contractual rate including unbilled estimate according to the invoice practical expedient amount are typically due within day of invoice commercial renewables also earns revenue from installation of distributed solar generation resource which is primarily composed of epc project to deliver functioning solar power system generally completed within two to month from commencement of construction the installation of distributed solar generation resource is performance obligation that is satisfied over time revenue from fixed price epc contract is recognized using the input method work is performed based on the estimated ratio of incurred cost to estimated total cost otherthe remainder of duke energy operation is presented other which doe not include material revenue from contract with customer statementsrevenuedisaggregated revenuesfor the electric and gas utility and infrastructure segment revenue by customer class is most meaningful to duke energy each respective customer class collectively represents unique customer expectation of service generally ha different energy and demand requirement and operates under tailored regulatory approved pricing structure additionally each customer class is impacted differently by weather and variety of economic factor including the level of population growth economic investment employment level and regulatory activity in each of duke energy jurisdiction such analyzing revenue disaggregated by customer class allows duke energy to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flow arising from contract with customer for the commercial renewables segment the majority of revenue from

revenue impact of weather and the timing of billing periodsrevenues and cost are influenced by seasonal weather pattern peak sale of electricity occur during the summer and winter month which result in higher revenue and cash flow during these period by contrast lower sale of electricity occur during the spring and fall allowing for scheduled plant maintenance residential and general service customer are more impacted by weather than industrial customer estimated weather impact are based on actual current period weather compared to normal weather condition normal weather condition are defined the long term average of actual historical weather condition heating degree day measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature fall below base temperature cooling degree day measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature rise above the base temperature each degree of temperature below the base temperature count one heating degree day and each degree of temperature above the base temperature count one cooling degree day statementsrevenuethe estimated impact of weather on earnings for electric utility and infrastructure is based on the temperature variance from normal condition and customer historic usage pattern the methodology used to estimate the impact of weather doe not consider all variable that may impact customer response to weather condition such humidity in the summer or wind chill in the winter the precision of this estimate may also be impacted by applying long term weather trend to shorter term period gas utility and infrastructure cost and revenue are influenced by seasonal pattern due to peak natural gas sale occurring during the winter month result of space heating requirement residential customer are the most impacted by weather there are certain regulatory mechanism for the north carolina south carolina tennessee and ohio service territory that normalize the margin collected from certain customer class during the winter in north carolina rate design provides protection from both weather and other usage variation such conservation while south carolina and tennessee revenue are adjusted solely based on weather ohio primarily employ fixed charge each month regardless of the season and usage unbilled revenueunbilled revenue are recognized by applying customer billing rate to the estimated volume of energy or natural gas delivered but not yet billed unbilled revenue can vary significantly from period to period result of seasonality weather customer
