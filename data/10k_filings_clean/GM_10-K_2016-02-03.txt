in the marketplace raw material service and supplieswe purchase wide variety of raw material part supply energy freight transportation and other service from numerous supplier for use in the manufacture of our product the raw material primarily include steel aluminum resin copper lead and platinum group metal we have not experienced any significant shortage of raw material and normally do not carry substantial inventory of such raw material in excess of level reasonably required to meet our production requirement in some instance we purchase system component part and supply from single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruption the inability or unwillingness of these source to supply with part and supply could have material adverse effect on our production capacity combined purchase from our two largest supplier have ranged from approximately to of our total purchase in the year ended december and environmental and regulatory mattersautomotive emission control of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiarieswe are subject to law and regulation that require to control automotive emission including vehicle exhaust emission standard vehicle evaporative emission standard and onboard diagnostic obd system requirement advanced obd system are used to identify and diagnose problem with emission control system problem detected by the obd system and in use compliance monitoring may increase warranty cost and the likelihood of recall emission and obd requirement become more stringent each year vehicle must meet lower emission standard and new diagnostics are required throughout the world without harmonization of global regulation zero emission vehicle zev requirement have been adopted by some state and is the possibility that additional jurisdiction could adopt zev requirement in the future while we believe all our product are designed and manufactured in material compliance with vehicle emission requirement regulatory authority may conduct ongoing evaluation of the emission compliance of product from all manufacturer this includes vehicle emission testing including and nitrogen oxide emission testing in europe and review of emission control strategy and canadathe federal government imposes stringent emission control requirement on vehicle sold in the and additional requirement are imposed by various state government canada federal government vehicle emission requirement are generally aligned with the federal requirement each model year we must obtain certification for each test group that our vehicle will meet emission requirement from the environmental protection agency epa we can sell vehicle in the and canada and from the california air resource board carb before we can sell vehicle in california and other state that have adopted the california emission requirement carb latest emission requirement include more stringent exhaust emission and evaporative emission standard including an increase in zevs offered by the automaker such electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicle carb ha adopted model year and later requirement for increasing volume of zevs to achieve greenhouse gas well criterion pollutant emission reduction to help achieve the state long term greenhouse gas reduction goal the epa ha adopted similar exhaust emission and evaporative emission standard which phase in with the model year do not include zev requirement these new requirement will also increase the time and mileage period which manufacturer are responsible for vehicle emission performance the clean air act permit state that have area with air quality compliance issue to adopt the california car and light duty truck emission standard in lieu of the federal requirement thirteen state currently have these standard in effect and of these state have adopted the zev requirement the province of quebec ha also announced it intention to adopt zev requirement european union emission are regulated by the european commission ec and by governmental authority in each european union member state eu member state the ec imposes emission control requirement on vehicle sold in all eu member state we must demonstrate that vehicle will meet emission requirement from an approval authority in one eu member state before we can sell vehicle in any eu member state the regulatory requirement include random testing of newly assembled vehicle and manufacturer in use surveillance program the european union requirement are equivalent in term of stringency and implementation to the framework of the united nation economic commission for europe the existing level of exhaust emission standard for car and light duty truck euro wa effective in for new vehicle approval and for new vehicle registration future european union emission standard focus particularly on further reducing emission from diesel vehicle by introducing new testing criterion based on real world driving emission rde rde test will become effective in the new requirement will require additional technology and further increase the cost of diesel engine which currently cost more than gasoline engine to comply with rde test we expect that we will need to implement technology identical to those already in production to meet emission standard these technology will put additional cost pressure on the already challenging european union market for small and mid size diesel vehicle gasoline engine are also affected by the new requirement the measure for gasoline vehicle that require technology to reduce exhaust pollutant emission will have adverse effect on vehicle fuel economy which drive additional technology cost to maintain fuel economy in addition increased scrutiny of compliance with emission standard following the well publicized emission scandal involving an unrelated automotive manufacturer may result in change to these standard including the implementation of rde test well stricter interpretation of these standard and more rigorous enforcement this may lead to increased cost penalty negative publicity or reputation impact for refer to item risk factor for further discussion of these risk of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesin the long term we expect that the ec will continue devising regulatory requirement on the emission test cycle real driving emission low temperature testing fuel evaporation and obd chinachina ha implemented european type china standard nationally with european obd requirement for all newly registered vehicle city such beijing shanghai and guangzhou each currently require china standard for newly registered vehicle in total eastern municipality and province will require china standard prior to nationwide implementation in the china standard include more stringent emission requirement and increase the time and mileage period over which manufacturer are responsible for vehicle emission performance china is considering unique china emission standard with the potential to

the federal cafe program through the model year in addition to federal cafe the epa requires compliance with greenhouse gas requirement that are similar to the cafe program our current product plan is expected to be compliant with the federal greenhouse gas program through the model year carb ha agreed that compliance with the federal program is deemed to be compliant with the california program for the through model year although canada ha no parallel cafe style fuel economy regulation there are canadian greenhouse gas regulation that are aligned with the epa regulation and the canadian fleet are expected to be compliant with the canadian regulation through the model year europe the eu ha implemented legislation regulating fleet average emission in europe and ha adopted an even more stringent fleet average target for requirement must be met through the introduction of reducing technology on conventional gasoline and diesel engine or through ultra low vehicle we are developing compliance plan by adopting operational target for each market entry in europe the ec will also devise regulatory requirement on the emission test cycle of chinachina ha both an individual vehicle pas

of full size pick up truck and suv while we offer balanced and complete portfolio of small mid size and large car crossover suv and truck we generally recognize higher profit margin on our full size pick up truck and suv our success is dependent upon consumer preference and our ability to sell higher margin vehicle in sufficient volume any increase in the price of oil or any sustained shortage of of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesoil including result of global political instability could cause shift in consumer demand towards smaller more fuel efficient vehicle and weaken the demand for our higher margin full size pick up truck and suv our business is highly dependent upon the global automobile market sale volume which can be volatile our business and financial result are highly sensitive to sale volume change to which can have disproportionately large effect on our profitability number of economic and market condition drive change in vehicle sale including real estate value level of unemployment availability of affordable financing fluctuation in the cost of fuel consumer confidence political unrest and global economic condition we can not predict future economic and market condition with certainty our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market condition maintaining strong position in the chinese market is key component of our global growth strategy the automotive market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturer and numerous smaller domestic manufacturer the size of the chinese market continues to increase we anticipate that additional competitor both international and domestic will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participant will act aggressively to increase their market share increased competition may result in price reduction reduced margin and our inability to gain or hold market share in addition our business in china is sensitive to economic and market condition that drive sale volume in china significant amount of our operation are conducted by joint venture that we can not operate solely for our benefit many of our operation primarily in china are carried by joint venture in joint venture we share ownership and management of company with one or more party who may not have the same goal strategy priority or resource we do and may compete with outside the joint venture joint venture are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all co owner rather than for our exclusive benefit operating business joint venture often requires additional organizational formality well time consuming procedure for sharing information and making decision in joint venture we are required to foster our relationship with our co owner well promote the overall success of the joint venture and if co owner change or relationship deteriorate our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected the benefit from successful joint venture are shared among the co owner therefore we do not receive all the benefit from our successful joint venture in addition because we share ownership and management with one or more party we may have limited control over the action of joint venture particularly when we minority interest result we may be unable to prevent misconduct or other violation of applicable law by joint venture moreover joint venture may not follow the same requirement regarding internal control and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent another party make decision that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issue arise within the joint venture we may have to take responsive or other action or we may be subject to penalty fine or other related action for these activity that could have material adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operation our business outside the expose to additional risk the majority of our vehicle are sold outside the we are pursuing growth opportunity for our business in variety of business environment outside the operating in large number of different region and country expose to political economic and other risk well multiple foreign regulatory requirement that are subject to change including change in foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate economic downturn in foreign country or geographic region where we have significant operation such china economic tension between government and change in international trade and investment policy including imposing restriction on the repatriation of dividend especially between the and china more detailed inspection higher tariff or new barrier to entry change in foreign regulation impacting our overall business model restricting our ability to buy and sell our product in those country especially china differing local product preference and product requirement including fuel economy vehicle emission and safety impact of compliance with and other foreign country export control and economic sanction liability resulting from and foreign law and regulation including those related to the foreign corrupt practice act and certain other anti corruption law of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiary differing labor regulation and union relationship consequence from change in tax law and difficulty in obtaining financing in foreign country for local operation we are subject to extensive law governmental regulation and policy including those regarding fuel economy and emission control the enforcement of which or change to existing one could cause to incur increased cost or to face regulatory enforcement action and may have significant effect on we do business we are significantly affected by governmental regulation that can increase cost related to the production of our vehicle and affect our product portfolio meeting or exceeding many of these regulation is costly and often technologically challenging especially where standard may not be harmonized across jurisdiction notable challenge with respect to mandated emission and fuel economy standard we anticipate that the number and extent of these regulation and the related cost and change to our product lineup may increase significantly in the future these government regulatory requirement could significantly affect our plan for global product development and given the uncertainty surrounding enforcement and regulatory definition may result in substantial cost including civil or criminal penalty in addition an evolving but un harmonized regulatory framework may limit or dictate the type of vehicle we sell and where we sell which can affect revenue refer to the environmental and regulatory matter section of item business for discussion of these regulatory requirement we also expect that manufacturer will be subject to increased scrutiny from regulator globally result of the well publicized emission scandal involving an unrelated automotive manufacturer in for example government agency in several country have asked for information one of these the german ministry of transportation is requesting the participation of number of automotive manufacturer including our german subsidiary in discussion on emission control issue and ha requested written response from our subsidiary on the subject this scrutiny regulatory change and increased enforcement may lead to increased testing and testing of our vehicle and analysis of their emission control system which could lead to increased cost penalty negative publicity or reputational impact and recall activity if regulator determine that emission level and required regulatory compliance be based on either wider spectrum of driving condition for future testing parameter or stricter or novel interpretation and consequent enforcement of existing requirement no assurance can be given that the ultimate outcome of any potential investigation or increased testing resulting from this scrutiny would not materially and adversely affect we are committed to meeting or exceeding fuel economy and emission control requirement we expect that to comply with these requirement we will be required to sell significant volume of hybrid electric vehicle well implement new technology for conventional internal combustion engine all at increased cost level there is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicle that use such technology on profitable basis or that our customer will purchase such vehicle in the quantity necessary for to comply with these regulatory program alternative compliance measure may not be sufficiently available in the marketplace to meet volume driven compliance requirement environmental liability for which we may be responsible are not reasonably estimable and could be substantial violation of safety or emission standard could result in the recall of one or more of our product negotiated remedial action possible fine restricted product offering or combination of any of those item any of these action could have substantial adverse effect on our operation including facility idling reduced employment increased cost and loss of revenue we could be materially adversely affected by negative outcome in unusual or significant litigation governmental investigation or other legal proceeding we are subject to legal proceeding involving various issue including product liability lawsuit stockholder litigation and governmental investigation such the legal proceeding related to the ignition switch recall refer to the gm north america section of md for additional information on the ignition switch recall such legal proceeding could in the future result in the imposition of damage including punitive damage substantial fine civil lawsuit and criminal penalty interruption of business modification of business practice equitable remedy and other sanction against or our personnel well significant legal and other cost for further discussion of these matter refer to note to our consolidated financial statement if in the discretion of the attorney office for the southern district of new york the office we do not comply with the term of the deferred prosecution agreement the dpa the office may prosecute for charge alleged by the office including those relating to faulty ignition switch on september we announced that we entered into the dpa with the office regarding it investigation of the event leading up to certain recall announced in february and march relating to faulty ignition switch under the dpa we of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesconsented to among other thing the filing of two count information the information in the district court for the southern district of new york charging gm with scheme to conceal material fact from government regulator and wire fraud we pled not guilty to the charge alleged in the information the dpa further provides that in the event the office determines during the period of deferral of prosecution or any extension thereof that we have violated any provision of the dpa including violating any federal law or our obligation to cooperate with and assist the independent monitor the office may in it discretion either prosecute on the charge alleged in the information or impose an extension of the period of deferral of prosecution of up to one additional year under such circumstance the office would be permitted to rely upon the admission we made in the dpa and would benefit from our waiver of certain procedural and evidentiary defense such criminal prosecution could subject to penalty that could have material adverse effect on our business financial position result of operation or cash flow the cost and effect on our reputation of product safety recall could materially adversely affect our business government safety standard require manufacturer to remedy certain product safety defect through recall campaign under these standard we could be subject to civil or criminal penalty or may incur various cost including significant cost for free repair at present the cost we incur in connection with these recall typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part we currently source variety of system component raw material and part including but not limited to air bag inflator from third party from time to time these item may have performance or quality issue that could harm our reputation and cause to incur significant cost for example based on defect information report filed with nhtsa by tk holding inc takata we are currently conducting recall for certain takata air bag inflator used in some of our prior model year vehicle we are continuing to ass the situation further recall if any that may be required to remediate takata air bag inflator in our vehicle could have material impact on our financial position result of operation or cash flow in addition product recall can harm our reputation and cause to lose customer particularly if those recall cause consumer to question the safety or reliability of our product conversely not issuing recall or not issuing recall on timely basis can harm our reputation potentially expose to significant monetary penalty and cause to lose customer for the same reason expressed above any disruption in our supplier operation could disrupt our production schedule our automotive operation are dependent upon the continued ability of our supplier to deliver the system component raw material and part that we need to manufacture our product our use of in time manufacturing process allows to maintain minimal inventory quantity of system component raw material and part result our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our supplier delivering sufficient quantity of system component raw material and part on time to meet our production schedule in some instance we purchase system component raw material and part from single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruption financial difficulty or solvency problem with our supplier which may be exacerbated by the cost of remediating quality issue with these item could lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruption for which could in turn disrupt our operation including production of certain of our higher margin vehicle where we experience supply disruption we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of system component raw material or part even for relatively short period of time could cause to alter production schedule or suspend production entirely we are dependent on our manufacturing facility around the world we assemble vehicle at various facility around the world these facility are typically designed to produce particular model for particular geographic market no single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicle in some case certain facility produce product that disproportionately contribute greater degree of profit to the company than others should these or other facility become unavailable either temporarily or permanently for any number of reason including labor disruption the inability to manufacture vehicle there may result in harm to our reputation increased cost lower revenue and the loss of customer we may not be able to easily shift production of vehicle at an inoperable facility to other facility or to make up for lost production any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirement need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirement and require specialized equipment even though we carry business interruption insurance policy we may suffer loss result of business interruption that exceed the coverage available or any loss which may be excluded under our insurance policy if we do not deliver new product service and customer experience in response to new participant in the automotive industry our business could suffer of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiarieswe believe that the automotive industry will experience more change in the next five year than it ha in the previous year in addition to our traditional competitor we must also be responsive to the entrance of non traditional participant in the automotive industry these non traditional participant may seek to disrupt the historic business model of the industry through the introduction of new technology new product or service new business model or new method of travel it is strategically significant that we lead the technological disruption occurring in our industry our business evolves the pressure to innovate will encompass wider range of product and service including product and service that may be outside of our historically core business if we do not accurately predict prepare for and respond to new kind of technological innovation market development and changing customer need our sale profitability and long term competitiveness may be harmed we operate in highly competitive industry that ha excess manufacturing capacity and attempt by our competitor to sell more vehicle could have significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating result the global automotive industry is highly competitive and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry exceeds demand many manufacturer have relatively high fixed labor cost well significant limitation on their ability to close facility and reduce fixed cost our competitor may respond to these relatively high fixed cost by providing subsidized financing or leasing program offering marketing incentive or reducing vehicle price our competitor may also seek to benefit from economy of scale by consolidating or entering into other strategic agreement such alliance intended to enhance their competitiveness manufacturer in lower cost country such china and india have become competitor in key emerging market and announced their intention of exporting their product to established market low cost alternative to established entry level automobile these action have had and are expected to continue to have significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating result and present significant risk to our ability to enhance our revenue per vehicle we may continue to restructure our operation in various country but we may not succeed in we face difficult market and operating condition in certain part of the world that may require to restructure impair or rationalize these operation in many country across our region we have experienced challenge in our operation and continue to strategically ass the manner in which we operate in certain country we continue to ass our performance throughout the region additional restructuring impairment and rationalization action may be required and may be material our future competitiveness and ability to achieve long term profitability depends on our ability to control our cost which requires to successfully implement operating effectiveness initiative throughout our automotive operation we are continuing to implement number of operating effectiveness initiative to improve productivity and reduce cost our future competitiveness depends upon our continued success in implementing these initiative throughout our automotive operation while some of the element of cost reduction are within our control others such interest rate or return on investment which influence our expense for pension depend more on external factor and there can be no assurance that such external factor will not materially adversely affect our ability to reduce our cost reducing cost may prove difficult due to our focus on increasing advertising and our belief that engineering expense necessary to improve the performance safety and customer satisfaction of our vehicle are likely to increase security breach and other disruption to our vehicle information technology network and system could interfere with the safety of our customer or our operation and could compromise the confidentiality of private customer data or our proprietary information we rely upon information technology network and system including in vehicle system and mobile device some of which are managed by third party to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support variety of vehicle or business process and activity additionally we collect and store sensitive

rely on gm financial in north america europe south america and china to support leasing and sale of our vehicle to consumer requiring vehicle financing and also to provide commercial lending to our

corresponding period in our european operation are benefiting from this trend and despite seasonally weak vehicle sale in the second half of compared to the first half of continue to show sign of

strategic action to strengthen our operation and increase our competitiveness the key action include investment in our product portfolio including the recently launched next generation opel astra and corsa revised brand strategy and reducing material development and production cost including restructuring activity the success of these action will depend on combination of our ability to execute and external factor which are outside of our control economic and market condition in russia remain and are expected to continue to be very challenging for the foreseeable future in addition we do not have appropriate localization level for key vehicle built in russia and we would need to make significant future capital investment in order to improve our localization level so that our product are competitive in the russian market result of these condition we determined that our russia business model wa not sustainable over the long term in we ceased manufacturing eliminated opel brand distribution and minimized chevrolet brand distribution in russia refer to note to our consolidated financial statement for additional information related to the impact of the change in our business

and challenging economic environment in china we are experiencing moderation of industry growth and pricing pressure higher than we initially anticipated due primarily to macroeconomic volatility softening consumer demand particularly in the commercial vehicle segment increasing competition and complex regulatory environment this ha resulted in growth in industry sale to million unit in despite these pressure we achieved record wholesale volume of million unit with market share of in the year ended december up percentage point compared to the increase in our market share wa primarily driven by our successful launch in our key growth segment of suv multipurpose vehicle and luxury vehicle including the buick envision and baojun and baojun became the second best selling suv in china

with our localization strategy of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesin the year ended december our automotive china jv generated equity income of billion and sustained strong margin despite higher than anticipated pricing pressure with carryover price reduction of approximately for saic general motor corp ltd sgm and moderation of industry growth this wa largely attributed to proactive management of challenge by optimizing vehicle mix and inventory level and aggressively reducing cost in we expect continuation of moderate industry growth macroeconomic volatility and carryover pricing pressure in the range of to despite the challenging macroeconomic environment we continue to expect an increase in vehicle sale driven by new launch and expect to sustain strong china equity income and margin by focusing on vehicle mix improvement and cost efficiency lack of political stability decreasing price of natural resource and foreign exchange volatility among other factor negatively impacted the overall automotive industry in the rest of asia pacific africa and the middle east and led to decrease of million unit or in the year ended december compared to this continued the recent trend of relatively flat industry of approximately million unit sold in each of the last several year in the year ended december our sale volume decreased by compared to leading to decline in market share of percentage point to in we expect the macroeconomic environment to remain challenging we continue to refresh our product portfolio and are addressing many of the challenge in these market while continuing to strategically ass the manner in which we operate in certain country to address the significant industry market share pricing and foreign exchange pressure in the region we continue to focus on product portfolio enhancement manufacturing footprint rationalization increased local sourcing of part cost structure reduction well brand and dealer network improvement

amount of asset and liability the disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense in the period presented we believe the accounting estimate employed are appropriate and the resulting balance are reasonable however due to the inherent uncertainty in developing estimate actual result could differ from the original estimate requiring adjustment to these balance in future period refer to note to our consolidated financial statement for our significant accounting policy related to our critical accounting estimate pension and opeb plan our defined benefit pension plan are accounted for on an actuarial basis which requires the selection of various assumption including an expected long term rate of return on plan asset discount rate mortality rate of participant and expectation of mortality improvement the expected long term rate of return on plan asset that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic study which include review of asset allocation strategy anticipated future long term performance of individual asset class risk using standard deviation and correlation of return among the asset class that comprise the of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesplans asset mix while the study give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical return the assumption are primarily long term prospective rate of return in december an investment policy study wa completed for the pension plan the study resulted in new target asset allocation being approved for the pension plan with resulting change to the expected long term rate of return on asset the weighted average long term rate of return on asset decreased from at december to at december the expected long term rate of return on plan asset used in determining pension expense for non plan is determined in similar manner to the plan another key assumption in determining net pension and opeb expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligation we estimate the assumed discount rate for plan using cash flow matching approach which us projected cash flow matched to spot rate along high quality corporate yield curve to determine the present value of cash flow effective we will apply the individual annual yield curve rate instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost this refinement more specifically link the cash flow related to service cost and interest cost to bond maturing in their year of payment the refinement had no effect on service cost or interest cost in the year ended december but will reduce the service cost and interest cost in by approximately billion there will be no effect on the determination of the plan obligation which will continue to be calculated using the assumed discount rate we have reviewed the mortality improvement table published by the society of actuary in the three month ended december and determined our current assumption are appropriate to measure our december pension plan benefit obligation significant difference in actual experience or significant change in assumption may materially affect the pension obligation the effect of actual result differing from assumption and the changing of assumption are included in unamortized net actuarial gain and loss that are subject to amortization to expense over future period the unamortized pre tax actuarial loss on our pension plan wa billion and billion at december and the change is primarily due to the increase in discount rate partially offset by actual asset return le than assumed return at december billion of the unamortized pre tax actuarial loss is outside the corridor of the projected benefit obligation pbo and subject to amortization the weighted average amortization period is approximately year resulting in amortization expense of billion in the underfunded status of the pension plan decreased by billion in the year ended december to billion due primarily to favorable effect due to an increase in discount rate of billion favorable effect of actual return on plan asset of billion and favorable contribution of billion partially offset by interest and service cost of billion the following table illustrates the sensitivity to change in certain assumption for the pension plan holding all other

which relate to vehicle lease to retail customer with lease term ranging from two to five year at the beginning of the lease contract determination is made of the estimated realizable value residual value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term which is the critical assumption underlying the estimated carrying value of leased asset the estimated realizable value is based on the lower of the contracted residual value or the current market estimate of residual value based on independent lease guide since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract gm financial is exposed to risk of loss to the extent the value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term is below the residual value estimated at contract inception over the life of the lease gm financial evaluates the adequacy of the estimate of the residual value and may make adjustment to the extent the expected value of the vehicle at lease termination change adjustment could result in change in the depreciation rate of the leased asset or if an impairment exists an impairment charge the following table summarizes vehicle included in gm financial equipment on operating lease net

million impact to depreciation expensecars product warranty and recall campaignsin gmna we accrue the cost for recall campaign at the time of vehicle sale in the other region there is not sufficient historical data to support the application of an actuarial based estimation technique and the estimated cost will be accrued at the time when they are probable and reasonably estimable which typically occurs it is determined specific recall campaign is needed and announced the estimate related to policy and product warranty are established using historical information on the nature frequency and average cost of claim of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumption about future activity and event when little or no claim experience exists for model year or vehicle line the estimate is based on comparable model the estimate related to recall campaign accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying frequency time severity approach that considers the number of recall event the number of vehicle per recall event the assumed number of vehicle that will be brought in by customer for repair take rate and the cost per vehicle for each recall event estimate contemplate the of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesnature frequency and magnitude of historical event with consideration for change in future expectation cost associated with campaign not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the per unit part and labor cost number of unit impacted and the take rate depending on part availability and time to complete repair we may from time to time offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customer these estimate are re evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information revision are made when necessary we consider trend of claim and take action to improve vehicle quality and minimize claim the estimated amount accrued for recall campaign at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall event the number of vehicle per recall event the take rate and the cost per vehicle for each recall event the estimated cost of recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaign would increase the estimated cost by approximately billion actual experience could differ from the amount estimated requiring adjustment to these liability in future period due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factor contributing to developing estimate change in our assumption could materially affect our result of operation sale incentive the estimated effect of sale incentive to dealer and end customer is recorded reduction of automotive net sale and revenue at the later of the time of sale or announcement of an incentive program to dealer there may be numerous type of incentive available at any particular time including choice of incentive for specific model incentive program are generally brand specific model specific or sale region specific and are for specified time period which may be extended significant factor used in estimating the cost of incentive include the volume of vehicle that will be affected by the incentive program offered by product product mix the rate of customer acceptance of any incentive program and the likelihood that an incentive program will be extended all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumption concerning customer behavior and future market condition when an incentive program is announced the number of vehicle in dealer inventory eligible for the incentive program is determined and reduction of automotive net sale and revenue is recorded in the period in which the program is announced if the actual number of affected vehicle differs from this estimate or if different mix of incentive is actually paid the reduction in automotive net sale and revenue incentive could be affected there are multitude of input affecting the calculation of the estimate for sale incentive and an
