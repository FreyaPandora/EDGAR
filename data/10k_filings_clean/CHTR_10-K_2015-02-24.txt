nationally centralized content connectivity and service the regional metro network component provide connectivity between the regional demarcation point and headends within specific geographic area and enable the delivery of content and service between these network component our last mile network utilizes hybrid fiber coaxial cable hfc architecture which combine the use of fiber optic cable with coaxial cable in most system we deliver our signal via fiber optic cable from the headend to group of node and use coaxial cable to deliver the signal from individual node to the home served by that node for our fiber internet ethernet carrier wholesale and pri commercial customer fiber optic cable is extended from the individual node all the way to the customer site our design standard is six strand of fiber to each node with two strand activated and four strand reserved for spare and future service we believe that this hybrid network design provides high capacity and signal quality the design also provides two way signal capability for the support of interactive service hfc architecture benefit include bandwidth capacity to enable traditional and two way video and broadband service dedicated bandwidth for two way service and signal quality and high service reliability approximately of our estimated passing are served by system that have bandwidth of megahertz or greater

residential customer this new brand reflects our comprehensive approach to industry leading product driven by speed performance and innovation marketing expenditure increased by million or over the year ended december to million for the year ended december result of the acquisition of bresnan in july heavier sale activity and sale channel development and higher commercial marketing our marketing organization creates and executes marketing program intended to increase customer retain existing customer and cross sell additional product to current customer we monitor the effectiveness of our marketing effort customer perception competition pricing and service preference among other factor to increase our responsiveness to our customer our marketing organization also manages and directs several sale channel including direct sale on line outbound telemarketing and charter store generalwe believe that offering wide variety of programming influence customer decision to subscribe to and retain our cable service we rely on our experience in programming cable system which includes market research customer demographic and local programming preference to determine channel offering in each of our market we obtain basic and premium programming from number of supplier usually pursuant to written contract our programming contract generally continue for fixed period of time usually from three to eight year and are subject to negotiated renewal some programming supplier offer financial incentive to support the launch of channel and or ongoing marketing support we also negotiate volume discount pricing structure we have more recently negotiated for additional content right allowing to provide programming on line to our authenticated customer costsprogramming is usually made available to for license fee which is generally paid based on the number of customer to we make such programming available programming cost are usually payable each month based on calculation performed by and are generally subject to annual cost escalation and may be subject to audit by the programmer programming license fee may include volume discount available for higher number of customer well discount for channel placement or service penetration some channel are available without cost to for limited period of time after which we pay for the programming for home shopping channel we receive percentage of the revenue attributable to our customer purchase well in some instance incentive for channel placement our programming cost have increased in every year we have operated in excess of customary inflationary and cost of living type increase we expect to continue to increase due to variety of factor including amount paid for retransmission consent annual increase imposed by programmer with additional selling power result of medium consolidation and carriage of incremental programming including new sport service and on line linear service and video on demand programming in particular programming cost are increasing result of significant sport programming cost increase over the past several year and the demand of large medium company who link carriage of their most popular network to carriage and cost increase for all of their network in addition contract to purchase sport programming sometimes provide for optional additional game to be added to the service and made available on surcharge basis during the term of the contract programmer continue to create new network and migrate popular programming such sporting event to those network spreading popular programming across more network often result in to pay more for suite of network offered by any one programmer finally programmer have experienced decline in demand for advertising advertiser shift more of their marketing spend online we believe this result in programmer demanding higher programming fee from programmer seek to recover revenue they are losing to online advertising federal law allows commercial television broadcast station to make an election between must carry right and an alternative retransmission consent regime when station opts for the retransmission consent regime we are not allowed to carry the station signal without the station permission continuing demand by owner of broadcast station for cash payment at substantial increase over amount paid in prior year in exchange for retransmission consent will increase our programming cost or require to cease carriage of popular programming potentially leading to loss of customer in affected market over the past several year increase in our video service rate have not fully offset increasing programming cost and with the impact of increasing competition and other marketplace factor we do not expect them to do so in the foreseeable future although we pas along portion of amount paid for retransmission consent to the majority of our customer our inability to fully pas these programming cost increase on to our video customer ha had and is expected in the future to have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margin associated with the video product in order to mitigate reduction of our operating margin due to rapidly increasing programming cost we continue to review our pricing and programming packaging strategy and we plan to continue to migrate certain program service from our basic level of service to our digital tier remove underperforming service and limit the launch of non essential new network we have programming contract that have expired and others that will expire at or the end of we will seek to renegotiate the term of these agreement there can be no assurance that these agreement will be renewed on favorable or comparable term to the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmer on term that we believe are reasonable we have been and may in the future be forced to remove such programming channel from our line up which may result in loss of customer of december our system operated pursuant to total of approximately franchise permit and similar authorization issued by local and state governmental authority such governmental authority often must approve transfer to another party most franchise are subject to termination proceeding in the event of material breach in addition most franchise require to pay the granting authority up to of revenue defined in the various agreement which is the maximum amount that may be charged under the applicable federal law we are entitled to and generally do pas this fee through to the customer prior to the scheduled expiration of most franchise we generally initiate renewal proceeding with the granting authority this process usually take three year but can take longer period of time the communication act of amended the communication act which is the primary federal statute regulating interstate communication provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which granting authority may not unreasonably withhold renewal in connection with the franchise renewal process many governmental authority require the cable operator to make certain commitment such building out certain of the franchise area customer service requirement and supporting and carrying public access channel historically we have been able to renew our

the broadband service provided by telephone company including both traditional dsl fiber to the node and fiber to the home offering our principal competitor for voice service are established telephone company other telephone service provider and other carrier including voip provider at this time we do not consider other traditional cable operator to be significant competitor in our overall market overbuilds are infrequent and geographically spotty although in any particular market cable operator overbuilder would likely be significant competitor at the local level we could however face additional competition from other cable operator if they began distributing video over the internet to customer residing outside their current territory our key competitor include db direct broadcast satellite is significant competitor to cable system the two largest db provider now serve more than million subscriber nationwide db service allows the subscriber to receive video service directly via satellite using dish antenna video compression technology and high powered satellite allow db provider to offer more than digital channel in major db competitor were especially competitive with promotional pricing for more basic service while we continue to believe that the initial investment by db customer exceeds that of cable customer the initial equipment cost for db ha decreased substantially the db provider have aggressively marketed offer to new customer of incentive for discounted or free equipment installation and multiple unit db provider are able to offer service nationwide and are able to establish national image and branding with standardized offering which together with their ability to avoid franchise fee of up to of revenue and property tax lead to greater efficiency and lower cost in the lower tier of service we believe that cable delivered video on demand and subscription video on demand service which include hd programming are superior to db service cable headends can provide communication to deliver many title which customer can access and control independently whereas db technology can only make available much smaller number of title with dvr like customer control db provider have also made attempt at deployment of internet access service via satellite but those service have been technically constrained and of limited appeal telephone company and utilitiesincumbent telephone company including at inc at and verizon communication inc verizon offer video and other service in competition with and we expect they will increasingly do so in the future these company are able to offer and provide two way video data service and digital voice service that are similar to in various portion of their network in the case of verizon it high speed data service fiber optic service fios offer speed high or higher than ours in addition these company continue to offer their traditional telephone service well service bundle that include wireless voice service provided by affiliated company based on internal estimate we believe that at and verizon are offering video service in area serving approximately and respectively of our estimated passing and we have experienced customer loss in these area at and verizon have also launched campaign to capture more of the multiple dwelling unit mdu market when at or verizon have introduced or expanded their offering of video product in our market area we have seen decrease in our video revenue at and verizon typically roll out aggressive marketing and discounting campaign to launch their product additionally in may at announced it intention to acquire directv the nation largest db provider if completed this transaction will create an even larger competitor for charter video service that will have the ability to expand it video service offering to include bundled wireless offering in addition to incumbent telephone company obtaining video franchise or alternative authorization in some area and seeking them in others they have been successful through various mean in reducing or streamlining the video franchising requirement applicable to them they have had significant success at the federal and state level in securing fcc ruling and numerous statewide video franchise law that facilitate telephone company entry into the video marketplace because telephone company have been successful in avoiding or reducing franchise and other regulatory requirement that remain applicable to cable operator like their competitive posture ha often been enhanced the large scale entry of incumbent telephone company direct competitor in the video marketplace ha adversely affected the profitability and valuation of our cable system most telephone company including at and verizon which already have plant an existing customer base and other operational function in place such billing and service personnel offer internet access via traditional dsl service dsl service allows internet access to subscriber at data transmission speed greater than those formerly available over conventional telephone line we believe dsl service is an alternative to our high speed internet service and is often offered at price lower than our internet service although typically at speed lower than the speed we offer dsl provider may currently be in better position to offer and data service to business since their network tend to be more complete in commercial area we expect dsl to remain significant competitor to our high speed internet service many large incumbent telephone company also provide fiber to the node or fiber to the home service in select area of their footprint fiber to the node network can provide faster internet speed than conventional dsl but still can not typically match our internet speed our primary fiber to the node competitor is at verse the competition from verse is expected to intensify over time at completes an expansion based on plan announced in late by the end of fiber to the home network however can provide internet speed equal to or greater than charter current internet speed verizon fios is the primary fiber to the home competitor although at ha also begun fiber to the home build well our voice service competes directly with incumbent telephone company and other carrier including internet based voip provider for both residential and commercial voice service customer because we offer voice service we are subject to considerable competition from such company and other telecommunication provider including wireless provider with an increasing number of consumer choosing wireless over wired telephone service the telecommunication and voice service industry is highly competitive and includes competitor with greater financial and personnel resource strong brand name recognition and long standing relationship with regulatory authority and customer moreover merger joint venture and alliance among our competitor have resulted in provider capable of offering cable television internet and voice service in direct competition with additionally we are subject to limited competition from utility and or municipal utility that posse fiber optic transmission line capable of transmitting signal with minimal signal distortion certain of these utility are also developing broadband over power line technology which may allow the provision of internet phone and other broadband service to home and office traditional overbuildscable system are operated under non exclusive franchise historically granted by state and local authority more than one cable system may legally be built in the same area franchising authority may grant second franchise to another cable operator that may contain term and condition more favorable than those afforded well financed business from outside the cable industry such public utility that already posse fiber optic and other transmission line in the area they serve have in some case become competitor there are number of city that have constructed their own cable system in manner similar to city provided utility service there also ha been interest in traditional cable overbuilds by private company not affiliated with established local exchange carrier constructing competing cable system is capital intensive process which involves high degree of risk we believe that in order to be successful competitor overbuild would need to be able to serve the home and business in the overbuilt area with equal or better service quality on more cost effective basis than we can any such overbuild operation would require access to capital or access to facility already in place that are capable of delivering cable television programming we can not predict the extent to which additional overbuild situation may occur broadcast televisioncable television ha long competed with broadcast television which consists of television signal that the viewer is able to receive without charge using an off air antenna the extent of such competition is dependent upon the quality and quantity of broadcast signal available through off air reception compared to the service provided by the local cable system traditionally cable television ha provided higher picture quality and more channel offering than broadcast television however the recent licensing of digital spectrum by the fcc now provides traditional broadcaster with the ability to deliver hd television picture and multiple digital quality program stream well advanced digital service such subscription video and data transmission internet delivered videointernet access facilitates the streaming of video including movie and television show into home and business online video service include those offered by hulu netflix amazon and apple increasingly content owner are using internet based delivery of content directly to consumer some without charging fee to access the content further due to consumer electronic innovation consumer are able to watch such internet delivered content on television personal computer tablet gaming box connected to television and mobile device recently hbo and cbs announced plan to sell their programming direct to consumer over the internet dish network ha also announced sling tv which will include espn among other programming and sony ha announced playstation vue which is expected to include channel to be launched in the first quarter of we believe some customer have chosen or will choose to receive video over the internet rather than through our video on demand and subscription video service thereby reducing our video revenue we can not predict the impact that internet delivered video will have on our revenue and adjusted ebitda technology continue to evolve cableadditional competition is posed by satellite master antenna television system or smatv system serving mdus such condominium apartment complex and private residential community private cable system can offer improved reception of local television station and many of the same satellite delivered program service that are offered by cable system although disadvantaged from programming cost perspective smatv system currently benefit from operating advantage not available to franchised cable system including fewer regulatory burden and no requirement to service low density or economically depressed community the fcc previously adopted regulation that favor smatv and private cable operator serving mdu complex allowing them to continue to secure exclusive contract with mdu owner this regulatory disparity provides competitive advantage to certain of our current and potential competitor other competitorslocal wireless internet service operate in some market using available unlicensed radio spectrum various wireless phone company are now offering third and fourth generation and wireless high speed internet service in addition growing number of commercial area such retail mall restaurant and airport offer wi fi internet service numerous local government are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized wi fi internet access network operator are also marketing pc card and personal hotspot offering wireless broadband access to their cellular network these service option offer another alternative to cable based internet access seasonality and cyclicality our business is subject to seasonal and cyclical variation our result are impacted by the seasonal nature of customer receiving our cable service in college and vacation market our revenue is subject to cyclical advertising pattern and change in viewership level our advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth calendar quarter of each year due in part to increase in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season advertising revenue is also cyclical benefiting in even numbered year from advertising related to candidate running for political office and issue oriented advertising regulation and legislation the following summary address the key regulatory and legislative development affecting the cable industry and our three primary service for both residential and commercial customer video service internet service and voice service cable system operation are extensively regulated by the federal government primarily the fcc certain state government and many local government failure to comply with these regulation could subject to substantial penalty our business can be dramatically impacted by change to the existing regulatory framework whether triggered by legislative administrative or judicial ruling congress and the fcc have frequently revisited the subject of communication regulation and they are likely to do so in the future we could be materially disadvantaged in the future if we are subject to new regulation that do not equally impact our key competitor we can not provide assurance that the already extensive regulation of our business will not be expanded in the future video service cable rate regulation federal regulation currently restrict the price that cable system charge for the minimum level of video programming service referred to basic service and associated equipment all other video service offering are now universally exempt from rate regulation although basic service rate regulation operates pursuant to federal formula local government commonly referred to local franchising authority are primarily responsible for administering this regulation the majority of our local franchising authority have never been certified to regulate basic service cable rate and order rate reduction and refund but they generally retain the right to do so subject to potential regulatory limitation under state franchising law except in those specific community facing effective competition defined under federal law we have secured fcc recognition of effective competition and become rate deregulated in many of our community there have been frequent call to impose expanded rate regulation on the cable industry confronted with rapidly increasing cable programming cost it is possible that congress may adopt new constraint on the retail pricing or packaging of cable programming any such constraint could adversely affect our operation federal rate regulation include certain marketing restriction that could affect our pricing and packaging of service tier and equipment we attempt to respond to changing marketplace with competitive pricing practice we may face regulation that impede our ability to compete carry retransmission consent there are two alternative legal method for carriage of local broadcast television station on cable system federal must carry regulation require cable system to carry local broadcast television station upon the request of the local broadcaster alternatively federal law includes retransmission consent regulation by which popular commercial television station can prohibit cable carriage unless the cable operator first negotiates for retransmission consent which may be conditioned on significant payment or other concession congress passed legislation in imposing certain restriction on broadcaster exercise of retransmission consent authority and directing the fcc to review aspect of it existing retransmission consent rule popular station invoking retransmission consent have been demanding substantial compensation increase in their recent negotiation with cable operator thereby significantly increasing our operating cost additional government mandated broadcast carriage obligation could disrupt existing programming commitment interfere with our preferred use of limited channel capacity and limit our ability to offer service that appeal to our customer and generate revenue access channel local franchise agreement often require cable operator to set aside certain channel for public educational and governmental access programming federal law also requires cable system to designate up to of their channel capacity for commercial leased access by unaffiliated third party who may offer programming that our customer do not particularly desire the fcc adopted revised rule in mandating significant reduction in the rate that operator can charge commercial leased access user and imposing additional administrative requirement that would be burdensome on the cable industry the effect of the fcc revised rule wa stayed by federal court pending cable industry appeal and an adverse finding by the office of management and budget although commercial leased access activity historically ha been relatively limited increased activity in this area could further burden the channel capacity of our cable system ownership restriction federal regulation of the communication field traditionally included host of ownership restriction which limited the size of certain medium entity and restricted their ability to enter into competing enterprise through series of legislative regulatory and judicial action most of these restriction have been either eliminated or substantially relaxed change in this regulatory area could alter the business environment in which we operate pole attachment the communication act requires most utility owning utility pole to provide cable system with access to pole and conduit and simultaneously subject the rate charged for this access to either federal or state regulation in the fcc amended it existing pole attachment rule to promote broadband deployment the order allows for new penalty in certain case involving unauthorized attachment but generally strengthens the cable industry ability to access investor owned utility pole on reasonable rate term and condition it specifically maintains the basic rate formula applicable to cable attachment but reduces the rate formula previously applicable to telecommunication attachment although the order maintains the status quo treatment of cable provided voip service an unclassified service eligible for the favorable cable rate the issue ha not been fully resolved by the fcc and potential change in classification in pending proceeding well an unresolved dispute over the telecommunication rate calculation could adversely impact our pole attachment rate cable equipment in congress enacted statute requiring the fcc to adopt regulation designed to assure the development of an independent retail market for navigation device such cable set top box result the fcc required cable operator to make separate offering of security module cablecard that can be used with retail navigation device some of the fcc rule requiring support for cablecards were vacated by the united state court of appeal for the district of columbia in the fcc had also adopted an integration ban which had required cable operator to use cablecards in all of their new set top box in april charter received two year waiver from the fcc integration ban on the condition that charter meet certain milestone regarding downloadable security by the end of the waiver period this waiver affords charter the ability to use lower cost set top box it transition to all digital operation in connection with our request for this waiver charter committed to continue to support cablecards and to follow the cablecard related rule that were struck by the court in in december part of the satellite television extension and localism act reauthorization act of stelar congress repealed the integration ban effective december and extended the then existing waiver including charter through that date stelar also directed the fcc to establish within day of enactment working group of technical expert to identify and report on downloadable security design option that are not unduly burdensome and that promote competition with respect to the availability of navigation device it is possible that the fcc could propose new equipment obligation result of the recommendation of this working group mdus inside wiring the fcc ha adopted series of regulation designed to spur competition to established cable operator in mdu complex these regulation allow our competitor to access certain existing cable wiring inside mdus the fcc also adopted regulation limiting the ability of established cable operator like to enter into exclusive service contract for mdu complex in their current form the fcc regulation in this area favor our competitor and information security regulation the communication act limit our ability to collect and disclose subscriber personally identifiable information for our video voice and internet service well provides requirement to safeguard such information we are subject to additional federal state and local law and regulation that impose additional restriction on the collection use and disclosure of consumer subscriber and employee information further the fcc ftc and many state regulate and restrict the marketing practice of cable operator including telemarketing and online marketing effort various federal agency including the ftc are now considering new restriction affecting the use of personal and profiling data for online advertising our operation are also subject to federal and state law governing information security in the event of an information security breach such rule may require consumer and government agency notification and may result in regulatory enforcement action with the potential of monetary forfeiture the fcc ha recently used the existing authority under it privacy and security requirement for voice service to bring enforcement action two company for failing to protect customer data from unauthorized access by and disclosure to third party with proposed forfeiture totaling million similarly the ftc and state attorney general regularly bring enforcement action against company related to information security breach and privacy violation congress and several state legislature are considering the adoption of new data security and cybersecurity legislation that could result in additional network and information security requirement for our business on february the national institute for standard and technology nist in cooperation with other federal agency and owner and operator of critical infrastructure released voluntary framework that provides prioritized and flexible model for organization to identify and manage cyber risk inherent to their business the nist cybersecurity framework wa directed by an executive order and presidential policy directive issued in and it is designed to supplement not supersede existing cybersecurity regulation and requirement several government agency have encouraged compliance with the nist cybersecurity framework including the fcc which is also considering expansion of it cybersecurity guideline or the adoption of cybersecurity requirement we can not predict what proposal may be adopted or new legislation and regulation if any would affect our business other fcc regulatory matter fcc regulation cover variety of additional area including among other thing equal employment opportunity obligation customer service standard technical service standard mandatory blackout of certain network and syndicated programming restriction on political advertising restriction on advertising in child programming licensing of system and facility maintenance of public file emergency alert system and disability access including new requirement governing video description and closed captioning each of these regulation restricts our business practice to varying degree and may impose additional cost on our operation it is possible that congress or the fcc will expand or modify it regulation of cable system in the future and we can not predict at this time how that might impact our business copyright cable system are subject to federal copyright compulsory license covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signal the possible modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing legislative proposal and administrative review and could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast programming the copyright office adopted final rule in implementing audit procedure for copyright owner to review operator copyright royalty reporting practice and it is possible these audit could result in copyright owner demand for additional royalty fee copyright clearance for non broadcast programming service are arranged through private negotiation cable operator also must obtain music right for locally originated programming and advertising from the major music performing right organization these licensing fee have been the source of litigation in the past and we can not predict with certainty whether license fee dispute may arise in the future franchise matter cable system generally are operated pursuant to nonexclusive franchise granted by municipality or other state or local government entity in order to utilize and cross public right of way cable franchise generally are granted for fixed term and in many case include monetary penalty for noncompliance and may be terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provision the specific term and condition of cable franchise vary significantly between jurisdiction cable franchise generally contain provision governing cable operation franchise fee system construction maintenance technical performance customer service standard and change in the ownership of the franchisee number of state subject cable system to the jurisdiction of centralized state government agency such public utility commission although local franchising authority have considerable discretion in establishing franchise term certain federal protection benefit cable operator for example federal law cap local franchise fee and includes renewal procedure designed to protect incumbent franchisees from arbitrary denial of renewal even if franchise is renewed however the local franchising authority may seek to impose new and more onerous requirement condition of renewal similarly if local franchising authority consent is required for the or sale of cable system the local franchising authority may attempt to impose more burdensome requirement condition for providing it consent the traditional cable franchising regime ha recently undergone significant change result of various federal and state action the fcc ha adopted rule that streamline entry for new competitor particularly those affiliated with telephone company and reduce certain franchising burden for these new entrant the fcc adopted more modest relief for existing cable operator at the same time substantial number of state have adopted new franchising law again these law were principally designed to streamline entry for new competitor and they often provide advantage for these new entrant that are not immediately available to existing cable operator in many instance these franchising regime do not apply to established cable operator until the existing franchise expires or competitor directly enters the franchise territory the exact nature of these state franchising law and their varying application to new and existing video provider will impact our franchising obligation and our competitive position internet service on january the circuit court of appeal in verizon fcc struck down major portion of the fcc net neutrality rule governing the operating practice of broadband internet access provider like the fcc originally designed the rule to ensure an open internet and included three key requirement for broadband provider prohibition against blocking website or other online application prohibition against unreasonable discrimination among internet user or among different website or other source of information and transparency requirement compelling the disclosure of network management policy the court struck down the first two requirement concluding that they constitute common carrier restriction that are not permissible given the fcc earlier decision to classify internet access an information service rather than telecommunication service the court upheld the fcc transparency requirement and the fcc authority to adopt regulation regarding the internet on may the fcc initiated new rulemaking to issue new network neutrality regulation potentially including reclassification of broadband service title ii common carrier service which could subject our service to far more extensive and burdensome federal and state regulation on february the chairman of the fcc released fact sheet describing proposed new rule the chairman proposal reclassifies wireline and wireless broadband service title ii common carrier service and asserts legal authority to regulate broadband service offered by isps under title ii title iii and section of the telecommunication act in an effort to protect consumer and edge provider the new rule would prohibit isps from engaging in blocking throttling and paid prioritization and the existing transparency rule would be enhanced reasonable network management activity would remain permitted for the first time the fcc would have authority to hear complaint and take enforcement action if it determines that the interconnection agreement of isps are not and reasonable or if isps fail to meet new general obligation not to harm consumer or edge provider the chairman ha proposed forbearing from certain title ii regulation such rate regulation tariff and last mile unbundling the chairman of the fcc ha indicated intends to have the commissioner vote on his proposal at the end of february the fcc is made up of five commissioner with three being democrat including the chairman it is likely the fcc will adopt the chairman proposed rule if adopted several broadband provider have already indicated their intention to challenge the regulation in court there are also legislative proposal in congress to preempt the chairman proposed utility style regulation while still addressing many of the underlying concern we do not know at the current time if the new regulation proposed by the chairman will go into effect do we know how they would be administered but they could limit our ability to efficiently manage our cable system and respond to operational and competitive challenge the internet ha matured it ha become the subject of increasing regulatory interest congress and federal regulator have adopted wide range of measure directly or potentially affecting internet use including for example consumer privacy copyright protection defamation liability taxation obscenity and unsolicited commercial mail our internet service are subject to the communication assistance for law enforcement act calea requirement regarding law enforcement surveillance content owner are now seeking additional legal mechanism to combat copyright infringement over the internet pending and future legislation in this area could adversely affect our operation an internet service provider and our relationship with our internet customer additionally the fcc and congress are considering subjecting internet access service to the universal service funding requirement these funding requirement could impose significant new cost on our high speed internet service also the fcc and some state regulatory commission direct certain subsidy to telephone company deploying broadband to area deemed to be unserved or underserved charter ha opposed such subsidy when directed to area that charter serf despite charter effort future subsidy may be directed to area served by charter which could result in subsidized competitor operating in our service territory state and local governmental organization have also adopted internet related regulation these various governmental jurisdiction are also considering additional regulation in these and other area such privacy pricing service product quality and taxation the adoption of new internet regulation or the adaptation of existing law to the internet could adversely affect our business the fcc is now considering whether online video distributor ovds that offer programming to customer with broadband internet connection should be classified multichannel video programming distributor mvpds and thereby subject to the program access protection available to mvpds well some of the regulatory requirement applicable to mvpds the outcome of this proceeding which could impact how ovds compete in the future with traditional cable service can not be determined at the current time on january the fcc in nation wide proceeding evaluating whether advanced broadband is being deployed in reasonable and timely fashion increased the minimum connection speed required to qualify advanced broadband service to mbps for downloads and mbps for uploads result the fcc concluded that advanced broadband wa not being sufficiently deployed and initiated new inquiry into what step it might take to encourage broadband deployment this action may lead the fcc to adopt additional measure affecting our broadband business at the same time the fcc ha ongoing proceeding to allocate additional spectrum for advanced wireless service which could provide additional wireless competition to our broadband business the fcc is also currently considering two petition from municipality in north carolina and tennessee respectively seeking the preemption of state law that restrict the ability of municipality to construct and deploy broadband system in competition with private offering the chairman ha proposed an order that grant the petition while such an order would only preempt the law of the state at issue municipality in other state may seek similar relief there are approximately such state law now in effect fcc preemption would be predicated on the belief that such state law are impeding the nation wide deployment of broadband service any such action would likely be subject to appeal regarding the fcc preemptive authority and congress might also adopt legislation expressly limiting the fcc authority in this area if the fcc doe preempt state restriction and that preemption is upheld it could lead to increased competition from municipal provided broadband voice servicethe telecommunication act of created more favorable regulatory environment for to provide telecommunication and or competitive voice service than had previously existed in particular it established requirement ensuring that competitive telephone company could interconnect their network with those provider of traditional telecommunication service to open the market to competition the fcc ha subsequently ruled that competitive telephone company that support voip service such those we offer our customer are entitled to interconnection with incumbent provider of traditional telecommunication service which ensures that our voip service can compete in the market since that time the fcc ha initiated proceeding to determine whether such interconnection right should extend to traditional and competitive network utilizing ip technology and how to encourage the transition to ip network throughout the industry new rule or obligation arising from these proceeding may affect our ability to compete in the provision of voice service on november the fcc released an order significantly changing the rule governing intercarrier compensation payment for the termination of telephone traffic between carrier the new rule will result in substantial decrease in intercarrier compensation payment over multi year period we received intercarrier compensation of approximately million million and million for the year ended december and respectively the decrease over the multi year transition will affect both the amount that charter pay to other carrier and the amount that charter receives from other carrier the schedule and magnitude of these decrease however will vary depending on the nature of the carrier and the telephone traffic at issue and the fcc new ruling initiate further implementation rulemakings we can not yet predict with certainty the balance of the impact on charter revenue and expense for voice service at particular time over this multi year period further regulatory change are being considered that could impact our voice business and that of our primary telecommunication competitor the fcc and state regulatory authority are considering for example whether certain common carrier regulation traditionally applied to incumbent local exchange carrier should be modified or reduced and the extent to which common carrier requirement should be extended to voip provider the fcc ha already determined that certain provider of voice service using internet protocol technology must comply with requirement relating to emergency service the calea the statute governing law enforcement access to and surveillance of communication universal service fund contribution customer privacy and customer proprietary network information issue number portability network outage reporting rural call completion disability access regulatory fee and discontinuance of service in march federal appeal court affirmed the fcc decision concerning federal regulation of certain voip service but declined to specifically find that voip service provided by cable company such we provide should be regulated only at the federal level result some state have begun proceeding to subject cable voip service to state level regulation although we have registered with or obtained certificate or authorization from the fcc and the state regulatory authority in those state in which we offer competitive voice service in order to ensure continuity of our service and to maintain needed network interconnection arrangement it is unclear whether and how these and other ongoing regulatory matter ultimately will be resolved in addition in the fcc issued broad data collection order that will require provider of point to point transport special access service such charter to produce information to the agency concerning the rate term and condition of these service the fcc will use the data to evaluate whether the market for such service is competitive or whether the market should be subject to further regulation which may increase our cost or constrain our ability to compete in this market the fcc is also considering recommendation to select new national local number portability administrator after the current administrator contract expires in june any such change may impact our ability to manage number porting and related task employee of december we had approximately full time equivalent employee at december approximately of our employee were represented by collective bargaining agreement we have never experienced work stoppage item risk factor risk related to our indebtedness we have significant amount of debt and may incur significant additional debt including secured debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to change in our business we have significant amount of debt and may subject to applicable restriction in our debt instrument incur additional debt in the future of december our total principal amount of debt wa approximately billion including billion of debt for which proceeds are held in escrow pending consummation of the transaction our significant amount of debt could have consequence such impact our ability to raise additional capital at reasonable rate or at all make vulnerable to interest rate increase because approximately of our borrowing are and may continue to be subject to variable rate of interest expose to increased interest expense to the extent we refinance existing debt with higher cost debt require to dedicate significant portion of our cash flow from operating activity to make payment on our debt reducing our fund available for working capital capital expenditure and other general corporate expense limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to change in our business the cable and telecommunication industry and the economy at large place at disadvantage compared to our competitor that have proportionately le debt and adversely affect our relationship with customer and supplier if current debt amount increase the related risk that we now face will intensify the agreement and instrument governing our debt contain restriction and limitation that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business well significantly affect our liquidity our credit facility and the indenture governing our debt contain number of significant covenant that could adversely affect our ability to operate our business our liquidity and our result of operation these covenant restrict among other thing our and our subsidiary ability to incur additional debt repurchase or redeem equity interest and debt issue equity make certain investment or acquisition pay dividend or make other distribution dispose of asset or merge enter into related party transaction and grant lien and pledge asset additionally the charter operating credit facility require charter operating to comply with maximum total leverage covenant and maximum first lien leverage covenant the breach of any covenant or obligation in our indenture or credit facility not waived or amended could result in default under the applicable debt obligation and could trigger acceleration of those obligation which in turn could trigger cross default under other agreement governing our long term indebtedness in addition the secured lender under the charter operating credit facility could foreclose on their collateral which includes equity interest in our subsidiary and exercise other right of secured creditor we depend on generating sufficient cash flow to fund our debt obligation capital expenditure and ongoing operation we are dependent on our cash on hand and cash flow from operation to fund our debt obligation capital expenditure and ongoing operation our ability to service our debt and to fund our planned capital expenditure and ongoing operation will depend on our ability to continue to generate cash flow and our access by dividend or otherwise to additional liquidity source at the applicable obligor our ability to continue to generate cash flow is dependent on many factor including our ability to sustain and grow revenue and cash flow from operation by offering video internet voice advertising and other service to residential and commercial customer to adequately meet the customer experience demand in our market and to maintain and grow our customer base particularly in the face of increasingly aggressive competition the need for innovation and the related capital expenditure the impact of competition from other market participant including but not limited to incumbent telephone company direct broadcast satellite operator wireless broadband and telephone provider dsl provider video provided over the internet and provider of advertising over the internet general business condition economic uncertainty or downturn high unemployment level and the level of activity in the housing sector our ability to obtain programming at reasonable price or to raise price to offset in whole or in part the effect of higher programming cost including retransmission consent the development and deployment of new product and technology and the effect of governmental regulation on our business or potential business combination transaction some of these factor are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or we are unable to

limitation on distribution and summary of restrictive covenant of our note restriction on distribution under the delaware limited liability company act the act our subsidiary may only make distribution if the relevant entity ha surplus defined in the act under fraudulent transfer law our subsidiary may not pay dividend if the relevant entity is insolvent or is rendered insolvent thereby the measure of insolvency for purpose of these fraudulent transfer law vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether fraudulent transfer ha occurred generally however an entity would be considered insolvent if the sum of it debt including contingent liability wa greater than the fair saleable value of all it asset the present fair saleable value of it asset wa le than the amount that would be required to pay it probable liability on it existing debt including contingent liability they become absolute and mature or it could not pay it debt they became due while we believe that our relevant subsidiary currently have surplus and are not insolvent these subsidiary may become insolvent in the future our direct or indirect subsidiary include the borrower under the cco safari credit facility and the borrower and guarantor under the charter operating credit facility ccoh safari and cco holding are each an obligor under their respective senior note of december our total principal amount of debt wa approximately billion including billion of debt for which proceeds are held in escrow pending consummation of the transaction the event of bankruptcy liquidation or dissolution of one or more of our subsidiary that subsidiary asset would first be applied to satisfy it own obligation and following such payment such subsidiary may not have sufficient asset remaining to make payment to it parent company an equity holder or otherwise in that event the lender under charter operating credit facility whose interest are secured by substantially all of our

safari outstanding note all of our outstanding debt is subject to change of control provision we may not have the ability to raise the fund necessary to fulfill our obligation under our indebtedness following change of control which would place in default under the applicable debt instrument we may not have the ability to raise the fund necessary to fulfill our obligation under our note and our credit facility following change of control under the indenture governing our note upon the occurrence of specified change of control event the debt issuer is required to offer to repurchase all of it outstanding note however we may not have sufficient access to fund at the time of the change of control event to make the required repurchase of the applicable note and charter operating is limited in it ability to make distribution or other payment to any debt issuer to fund any required repurchase in addition change of control under the charter operating credit facility would result in default under those credit facility because such credit facility are obligation of charter operating the credit facility would have to be repaid before charter operating asset could be available to cco holding or ccoh safari to repurchase their note any failure to make or complete change of control offer would place cco holding or ccoh safari in default under it note the failure of our subsidiary to make change of control offer or repay the amount accelerated under their note and credit facility would place them in default risk related to our business we operate in competitive business environment which affect our ability to attract and retain customer and can adversely affect our business operation and financial result the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and ha become more so in recent year in some instance we compete against company with fewer regulatory burden better access to financing greater personnel resource greater resource for marketing greater and more favorable brand name recognition and long established relationship with regulatory authority and customer increasing consolidation in the cable industry and the repeal of certain ownership rule have provided additional benefit to certain of our competitor either through access to financing resource or efficiency of scale we could also face additional competition from multi channel video provider if they began distributing video over the internet to customer residing outside their current territory our principal competitor for video service throughout our territory are db provider the two largest db provider are directv and dish network competition from db including intensive marketing effort with aggressive pricing exclusive programming and increased hd broadcasting ha had an adverse impact on our ability to retain customer db company have also expanded their activity in the mdu market telephone company including two major telephone company at and verizon offer video and other service in competition with and we expect they will increasingly do so in the future upgraded portion of these network carry two way video data service and provide digital voice service similar to ours in the case of verizon fios high speed data service offer speed high or higher than ours in addition these company continue to offer their traditional telephone service well service bundle that include wireless voice service provided by affiliated company based on our internal estimate we believe that at and verizon are offering video service in area serving approximately and respectively of our estimated passing and we have experienced customer loss in these area at and verizon have also launched campaign to capture more of the mdu market at ha publicly stated that it expects to roll out it video product beyond the territory currently served although it is unclear where and to what extent when at or verizon have introduced or expanded their offering of video product in our market area we have seen decrease in our video revenue at and verizon typically roll out aggressive marketing and discounting campaign to launch their product additionally in may at announced it intention to acquire directv the nation largest db provider if completed this transaction will create an even larger competitor for charter video service that will have the ability to expand it video service offering to include bundled wireless offering to consumer electronic innovation content owner are allowing consumer to watch internet delivered content on television personal computer tablet gaming box connected to television and mobile device some without charging fee to access the content technological advancement such video on demand new video format and internet streaming and downloading have increased the number of entertainment and information delivery choice available to consumer and intensified the challenge posed by audience fragmentation for example online video service continue to offer consumer alternative including hulu netflix amazon and apple recently hbo and cbs announced plan to sell their programming direct to consumer over the internet dish ha also announced sling tv which will include espn among other programming and sony ha announced playstation vue which is expected to include tv channel to be launched in the first quarter of the increasing number of choice available to audience could also negatively impact advertiser willingness to purchase advertising from well the price they are willing to pay for advertising with respect to our internet access service we face competition including intensive marketing effort and aggressive pricing from telephone company primarily at and verizon and other provider of dsl fiber to the node and fiber to the home service dsl service competes with our internet service and is often offered at price lower than our internet service although often at speed lower than the speed we offer fiber to the node network can provide faster internet speed than conventional dsl but still can not typically match our internet speed fiber to the home network however can provide internet speed equal to or greater than our current internet speed in addition in many of our market dsl provider have entered into co marketing arrangement with db provider to offer service bundle combining video service provided by db provider with dsl and traditional telephone and wireless service offered by the telephone company and their affiliate these service bundle offer customer similar pricing and convenience advantage our bundle continued growth in our residential voice business face risk the competitive landscape for residential and commercial telephone service is intense we face competition from provider of internet telephone service well incumbent telephone company further we face increasing competition for residential voice service more consumer in the united state are replacing traditional telephone service with wireless service we expect to continue to price our voice product aggressively part of our triple play strategy which could negatively impact our revenue from voice service to the extent we do not increase volume the existence of more than one cable system operating in the same territory is referred to an overbuild overbuilds could adversely affect our growth financial condition and result of operation by creating or increasing competition we are aware of traditional overbuild situation impacting certain of our market however we are unable to predict the extent to which additional overbuild situation may occur in order to attract new customer from time to time we make promotional offer including offer of temporarily reduced price or free service these promotional program result in significant advertising programming and operating expense and also may require to make capital expenditure to acquire and install customer premise equipment customer who subscribe to our service result of these offering may not remain customer following the end of the promotional period failure to retain customer could have material adverse effect on our business merger joint venture and alliance among franchised wireless or private cable operator db provider local exchange carrier and others may provide additional benefit to some of our competitor either through access to financing resource or efficiency of scale or the ability to provide multiple service in direct competition with in addition to the various competitive factor discussed above our business competes with all other source of entertainment and information delivery including broadcast television movie live event radio broadcast home video product console game print medium and the internet if we do not respond appropriately to further increase in the leisure and entertainment choice available to consumer our competitive position could deteriorate and our financial result could suffer our service may not allow to compete effectively competition may reduce our expected growth of future cash flow which may contribute to future impairment of our franchise and goodwill and our ability to meet cash flow requirement including debt service requirement our exposure to the economic condition of our current and potential customer vendor and third party could adversely affect our cash flow result of operation and financial condition we are exposed to risk associated with the economic condition of our current and potential customer the potential financial instability of our customer and their financial ability to purchase our product if there were general economic downtown we may experience increased cancellation by our customer or unfavorable change in the mix of product purchased these event have adversely affected in the past and may adversely affect our cash flow result of operation and financial condition if downturn were to occur addition we are susceptible to risk associated with the potential financial instability of the vendor and third party on which we rely to provide product and service or to which we outsource certain function the same economic condition that may affect our customer well volatility and disruption in the capital and credit market also could adversely affect vendor and third party and lead to significant increase in price reduction in output or the bankruptcy of our vendor or third party upon which we rely any interruption in the service provided by our vendor or by third party could adversely affect our cash flow result of operation and financial condition we face risk inherent in our commercial business we may encounter unforeseen difficulty we increase the scale of our service offering to business we sell internet access data networking and fiber connectivity to cellular tower and office building video and business voice service to business and have increased our focus on growing this business in order to grow our commercial business we expect to continue investment in technology equipment and personnel focused on the commercial business commercial business customer often require service level agreement and generally have heightened customer expectation for reliability of service if our effort to build the infrastructure to scale the commercial business are not successful the growth of our commercial service business would be limited we depend on interconnection and related service provided by certain third party for the growth of our commercial business result our ability to implement change the service grow may be limited if we are unable to meet these service level requirement or expectation our commercial business could be adversely affected finally we expect advance in communication technology well change in the marketplace and the regulatory and legislative environment consequently we are unable to predict the effect that ongoing or future development in these area might have on our voice and commercial business and operation programming cost are rising at much faster rate than wage or inflation and we may not have the ability to reduce or moderate the growth rate of or pas on to our customer our increasing programming cost which would adversely affect our cash flow and operating margin programming ha been and is expected to continue to be our largest operating expense item in recent year the cable industry ha experienced rapid escalation in the cost of programming we expect programming cost to continue to increase because of variety of factor including amount paid for retransmission consent annual increase imposed by programmer with additional selling power result of medium consolidation incremental programming including new sport service out of home or non linear programming and attempt by programmer to replace advertising revenue they are losing to online marketing option and result of declining viewership rating the inability to fully pas these programming cost increase on to our customer ha had an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margin associated with the video product we have programming contract that have expired and others that will expire at or before the end of there can be no assurance that these agreement will be renewed on favorable or comparable term to the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmer on term that we believe are reasonable we may be forced to remove such programming channel from our line up which could result in further loss of customer increased demand by owner of some broadcast station for carriage of other service or payment to those broadcaster for retransmission consent are likely to further increase our programming cost federal law allows commercial television broadcast station to make an election between must carry right and an alternative retransmission consent regime when station opts for the latter cable operator are not allowed to carry the station signal without the station permission in some case we carry station under short term arrangement while we attempt to negotiate new long term retransmission agreement if negotiation with these programmer prove unsuccessful they could require to cease carrying their signal possibly for an indefinite period any loss of station could make our video service le attractive to customer which could result in le subscription and advertising revenue in retransmission consent negotiation broadcaster often condition consent with respect to one station on carriage of one or more other station or programming service in which they or their affiliate have an interest carriage of these other service well increased fee for retransmission right may increase our programming expense and diminish the amount of capacity we have available to introduce new service which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial result our inability to respond to technological development and meet customer demand for new product and service could limit our ability to compete effectively our business is characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction of new product and service some of which are bandwidth intensive we may not be able to fund the capital expenditure necessary to keep pace with technological development execute the plan to do so or anticipate the demand of our customer for product and service requiring new technology or bandwidth the implementation of our network based user interface spectrum guide and downloadable security necessary for our worldbox set top box strategy may ultimately be unsuccessful or more expensive than anticipated in order to realize the of our worldbox technology we must implement our downloadable conditional access security in our regional video network our inability to maintain and expand our upgraded system and provide advanced service such state of the art user interface in timely manner or to anticipate the demand of the marketplace could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customer consequently our growth financial condition and result of operation could suffer materially we depend on third party service provider supplier and licensors thus if we are unable to procure the necessary service equipment software or license on reasonable term and on timely basis our ability to offer service could be impaired and our growth operation business financial result and financial condition could be materially adversely affected we depend on third party service provider supplier and licensors to supply some of the service hardware software and operational support necessary to provide some of our service we obtain these material from limited number of vendor some of which do not have long operating history or which may not be able to continue to supply the equipment and service we desire some of our hardware software and operational support vendor and service provider represent our sole source of supply or have either through contract or result of intellectual property right position of some exclusivity if demand exceeds these vendor capacity or if these vendor experience operating or financial difficulty or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or service we need in timely manner at our specification and at reasonable price our ability to provide some service might be materially adversely affected or the need to procure or develop alternative source of the affected material or service might delay our ability to serve our customer these event could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customer and have material negative impact on our operation business financial result and financial condition limited number of vendor of key technology can lead to le product innovation and higher cost our cable system have historically been restricted to using one of two proprietary conditional access security system which we believe ha limited the number of manufacturer producing set top box for such system an alternative charter ha developed conditional access security system which may be downloaded into set top box with feature we specify that could be provided by variety of manufacturer we refer to our specified set top box our worldbox in order to realize the benefit of our worldbox technology we must now implement the conditional access security system across our video network we can not provide assurance that this implementation will ultimately be successful or completed in the expected timeframe or at the expected budget we further depend on patent copyright trademark and trade secret law and license to establish and maintain our intellectual property right in technology and the product and service used in our operating activity any of our intellectual property right could be challenged or invalidated or such intellectual property right may not be sufficient to permit to continue to use certain intellectual property which could result in discontinuance of certain product or service offering or other competitive harm our incurring substantial monetary liability or being enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question various event could disrupt our network information system or property and could impair our operating activity and negatively impact our reputation network and information system technology are critical to our operating activity well our customer access to our service we may be subject to information technology system failure and network disruption malicious and abusive activity such the dissemination of computer virus worm and other destructive or disruptive software computer hackings social engineering process breakdown denial of service attack and other malicious activity have become more common in industry overall if directed at or technology upon which we depend these activity could have adverse consequence on our network and our customer including degradation of service excessive call volume to call center and damage to our or our customer equipment and data further these activity could result in security breach such misappropriation misuse leakage falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology system and network and in our vendor system and network including customer personnel and vendor data system failure and network disruption may also be caused by natural disaster accident power disruption or telecommunication failure if significant incident were to occur it could damage our reputation and credibility lead to customer dissatisfaction and ultimately loss of customer or revenue in addition to increased cost to service our customer and protect our network these event also could result in large expenditure to repair or replace the damaged property network or information system or to protect them from similar event in the future system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventuality any significant loss of customer or revenue or significant increase in cost of serving those customer could adversely affect our growth financial condition and result of operation for tax purpose we could experience deemed ownership change in the future that could limit our ability to use our tax loss carryforwards of december we had approximately billion of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in gross deferred tax asset of approximately billion federal tax net operating loss carryforwards expire in the year through these loss resulted from the operation of charter holdco and it subsidiary in addition of december we had state tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in gross deferred tax asset net of federal tax benefit of approximately million state tax net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in the year through due to uncertainty in projected future taxable income valuation allowance have been established against the gross deferred tax asset for book accounting purpose except for future taxable income that will result from the reversal of existing temporary difference for which deferred tax liability are recognized such tax loss carryforwards can accumulate and be used to offset our future taxable income in the past we have experienced ownership change defined in section of the internal revenue code of amended the code in general an ownership change occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of corporation owned directly or indirectly by percent stockholder within the meaning of section of the code increase by more than percentage point over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned directly or indirectly by such percent stockholder at any time over the preceding three year result we are subject to an annual limitation on the use of our loss carryforwards which existed at november for the first ownership change and those that existed at may for the second ownership change the limitation on our ability to use our loss carryforwards in conjunction with the loss carryforward expiration provision could reduce our ability to use portion of our loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income which could result in being required to make material cash tax payment our ability to make such income tax payment if any will depend at such time on our liquidity or our ability to raise additional capital and or on receipt of payment or distribution from charter holdco and it subsidiary if we were to experience third ownership change in the future result of purchase and sale of stock by our percent stockholder new issuance or redemption of our stock certain acquisition of our stock and issuance redemption sale or other disposition or acquisition of interest in our percent stockholder our ability to use our loss carryforwards could become subject to further limitation our common stock is subject to certain transfer restriction contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation these restriction which are designed to minimize the likelihood of an ownership change occurring and thereby preserve our ability to utilize our loss carryforwards are not currently operative but could become operative in the future if certain event occur and the restriction are imposed by our board of director however there can be no assurance that our board of director would choose to impose these restriction or that such restriction if imposed would prevent an ownership change from occurring if we are unable to retain key employee our ability to manage our business could be adversely affected our operational result have depended and our future result will depend upon the retention and continued performance of our management team our ability to retain and hire new key employee for management position could be impacted adversely by the competitive environment for management talent in the broadband communication industry the loss of the service of key member of management and the inability or delay in hiring new key employee could adversely affect our ability to manage our business and our future operational and financial result our inability to successfully acquire and integrate other business asset product or technology could harm our operating result we continuously evaluate and pursue small and large acquisition and strategic investment in business product or technology that we believe could complement or expand our business or otherwise offer growth or cost saving opportunity from time to time including in the near term we may enter into letter of intent with company with which we are negotiating for potential acquisition or investment or to which we are conducting due diligence an investment in or acquisition of complementary business product or technology in the future could materially decrease the amount of our available cash or require to seek additional equity or debt financing we may not be successful in negotiating the term of any potential acquisition conducting thorough due diligence financing the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business product or technology into our existing business and operation our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problem liability or other shortcoming or challenge of an acquired business product or technology including issue related to intellectual property product quality or product architecture regulatory compliance practice revenue recognition or other accounting practice or employee or customer issue additionally in connection with any acquisition we complete we may not achieve the growth synergy or other benefit we expected to achieve and we may incur write down impairment charge or unforeseen liability that could negatively affect our operating result or financial position or could otherwise harm our business further contemplating or completing an acquisition and integrating an acquired business product or technology individually or across multiple opportunity could divert management and employee time and resource from other matter related to ownership position of liberty broadband corporationliberty broadband corporation owns

could have different implication for it and risk related to the transactionsas result of the transaction current charter stockholder ownership interest in charter will be diluted from to approximately immediately following the transaction it is expected that the current stockholder of charter who presently own of charter will own approximately of the outstanding common stock of charter the transaction therefore will result in substantial dilution of the ownership interest of the current charter stockholder additionally due to the ownership dilution charter current stockholder group will be able to exercise le influence after the transaction than they currently exercise over the management operation and policy for charter if greatland connection raise le proceeds in the related financing transaction than currently contemplated charter is obligated pursuant to the merger agreement and the financing arrangement to increase it stock consideration paid in the charter merger which would further dilute existing charter stockholder also pursuant to the merger agreement if the price at which share of charter trade were to be lower during the day leading up to the closing of the transaction charter would have to issue more share further diluting existing charter stockholder completion of the transaction is subject to number of condition and if these condition are not

greatland connection spin off from comcast there can be no assurance that the condition to closing of the transaction will be satisfied or waived or that the transaction will be completed in order to complete the transaction we along with comcast must obtain certain governmental authorization and if such authorization are not granted or are granted with condition to the party completion of the transaction may be jeopardized or the anticipated benefit of the transaction could be reduced completion of the transaction is conditioned upon the expiration or early termination of the waiting period relating to the transaction under the hsr act and the required governmental authorization including an order of the fcc having been obtained and being in full force and effect although we and comcast have agreed in the transaction agreement to use reasonable best effort subject to certain limitation to obtain the required governmental authorization there can be no assurance that the relevant waiting period will expire or that the relevant authorization will be obtained in addition the governmental authority with or from which these authorization are required have broad discretion in administering the governing regulation condition to authorization of the transaction these governmental authority may impose requirement limitation or cost or require divestiture or place restriction on the conduct of our business after completion of the transaction there can be no assurance that regulator will not impose condition term obligation or restriction and that such condition term obligation or restriction will not have the effect of delaying completion of the transaction or imposing additional material cost on or materially limiting the revenue of new charter following the transaction or otherwise adversely affect our business and result of operation after completion of the transaction in addition we can provide no assurance that these condition term obligation or restriction will not result in the delay or abandonment of the transaction we have relied on publicly available information and ongoing diligence on the system being acquired by charter and by greatland connection we have relied on publicly available information and ongoing diligence regarding the system being acquired by charter and by greatland connection the transaction accordingly provide for assumption by charter and by greatland connection of only those liability that are primarily related to the system acquired by each of them respectively and for valuation term that will depend on actual carveout ebitda defined in the transaction agreement produced by such system including true up adjustment payment related to ebitda and in some case working capital however it is possible that significant liability present future or contingent may be assumed by charter or greatland connection that are not fully reflected in the valuation term and accordingly could have material adverse effect on charter and or it investment in greatland connection similarly it is possible that certain asset required to operate the system acquired by greatland connection and or charter such license technology and or employee may not be transferred in the transaction requiring greatland connection and or charter to incur additional cost and invest additional resource to procure such asset and or hire employee with expertise in the transferred business which may adversely affect charter ability to realize the anticipated benefit of the transaction we have already entered into the agreement for the transaction without any diligence condition our ongoing diligence is not expected to give rise to any material adjustment in the transaction and our ongoing diligence continues to focus on the transition of the to be acquired system to our ownership or the provision of service in the case of greatland connection we may not realize anticipated cost synergy and growth opportunity we expect that we will realize cost synergy growth opportunity and other financial and operating benefit result of the transaction our success in realizing these cost synergy growth opportunity and other financial and operating benefit and the timing of this realization depends on the successful integration of the business operation obtained in the asset exchange and the asset purchase and our ability to provide certain service to greatland connection effectively pursuant to service agreement even if we are able to integrate the business operation obtained in the asset exchange and the asset purchase successfully we can not predict with certainty if or when these cost synergy growth opportunity and benefit will occur or the extent to which they actually will be achieved for example the benefit from the transaction may be offset by cost incurred in integrating the new business operation or in obtaining or attempting to obtain regulatory approval for the transaction or negatively impacted by potential programming dis synergy that we may experience result of the transaction realization of any benefit and cost synergy could be affected by the factor described in other risk factor and number of factor beyond our control including without limitation general economic condition increased operating cost the response of competitor and regulatory development addition certain license and customer contract which are required to be transferred to greatland connection or charter by comcast require the consent of the licensor or customer party to the contract to effect this assignment comcast greatland connection and charter may be unable to obtain these consent on term favorable to greatland connection or charter respectively or at all which could have material adverse impact on greatland connection and hence on or on our business financial condition and result of operation after the transaction there can be no assurance that third party consent will be obtained prior to completion of the transaction or at all the integration of the business acquired in the asset exchange and asset purchase with the business we operated prior to the asset exchange and asset purchase may not be successful or the anticipated benefit from the asset exchange and asset purchase may not be realized after consummation of the asset exchange and asset purchase we will have significantly more system asset investment business customer and employee than we prior to the asset exchange and asset purchase the process of integrating these asset with the business we operated prior to the asset exchange and asset purchase will require to expend significant capital and significantly expand the scope of our operation and operating and financial system our management will be required to devote significant amount of time and attention to the process of integrating the operation of the acquired asset with our operation before the asset exchange and asset purchase there is significant degree of difficulty and management involvement inherent in that process these difficulty include integrating the operation of the acquired asset while carrying on the ongoing operation of the business we operated prior to the asset exchange and asset purchase integrating information purchasing provisioning accounting finance sale billing payroll reporting and regulatory compliance system integrating and unifying the product offering and service available to customer including customer premise equipment and video user interface completing the conversion of analog system to all digital for the system to be acquired managing significantly larger company than before consummation of the asset exchange and asset purchase integrating separate business culture attracting and retaining the necessary personnel associated with the acquired asset and creating uniform standard control procedure policy and information system and controlling the cost associated with such matter and the impact on our business of providing service to greatland connection which will also face the foregoing difficulty charter and comcast have agreed to provide each other with transition service in connection with the transferred system and relevant asset providing such service could divert management attention and result in additional cost particularly charter start up infrastructure and staff to take over transition service and provides transition service to comcast for former charter system in addition the inability to procure such service could negatively impact our expected result of operation there is no assurance that the asset acquired in the asset exchange and asset purchase will be successfully or cost effectively integrated into the business we operated prior to the asset exchange and asset purchase the process of integrating the acquired asset into our operation prior to the asset exchange and asset purchase may cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activity of our business if our management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activity are interrupted result of the integration process our business could suffer and our liquidity result of operation and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted even if we are able to successfully integrate the new asset it may not be possible to realize the benefit that are expected to result from the asset exchange and asset purchase or realize these benefit within the time frame that is expected for example the elimination of duplicative cost may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated or the benefit from the asset exchange and asset purchase may be offset by cost incurred or delay in integrating the company programming dis synergy could also be larger than expected if we fail to realize the benefit we anticipate from the acquisition our liquidity result of operation or financial condition may be adversely affected the value of our interest in greatland connection following the transaction may fluctuate from time to time based on factor beyond our control following the transaction the value of our interest in greatland connection will depend on greatland connection operational performance and fluctuation in it share price we will not control the management and operation of greatland connection and we will therefore not be able to prevent or address any decline in the operational performance or trading value of greatland connection in addition the operational performance and trading value of greatland connection may be influenced by other outside our control including risk resulting from the separation of the cable system from comcast change in earnings estimated by security analyst or greatland connection ability to meet those estimate and domestic and foreign economic condition if the operating result for greatland connection following the transaction are poor we may not achieve the increase in revenue and earnings per share that we expect result of the transaction we have projected that we will derive portion of our revenue and earnings per share from greatland connection after the transaction through receipt of service fee of of greatland connection revenue pursuant to service agreement in addition we will record of greatland connection net income which will also have an impact on our operating result therefore any negative impact on greatland connection or the operation of greatland connection business could harm our operating result some of the significant factor that could harm greatland connection and the operation of the greatland connection business and therefore harm our future operating result after the transaction include competitive pressure from existing or new company and decline in the market served by greatland connection if the operating result of the twc asset acquired in the asset exchange and the asset purchase are le than our expectation or an increase in the capital expenditure to upgrade and maintain those asset well to keep pace with technological development is necessary charter may not achieve the expected level of financial result from the transaction we have projected that we will derive portion of our revenue and earnings per share from the operation of the twc asset that we will acquire in the asset exchange and the asset purchase therefore any negative impact on the twc asset to be acquired by or the operating result derived from such exchanged and purchased asset could harm our operating result our business is characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction of new product and service we intend to make all digital investment in the twc asset acquired in the asset exchange and asset purchase and transition toward only using two way interactive set top box the increase in capital expenditure necessary for the all digital investment and the transition toward two way set top box in the twc asset may negatively impact the expected financial result from the transaction we may not be able to fund the capital expenditure necessary to keep pace with technological development execute the plan to do so or anticipate the demand of our customer for product and service requiring new technology or bandwidth our inability to maintain expand and upgrade our existing or acquired asset including through all digital initiative for the twc asset could materially adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation because of high debt level we may not be able to service our debt obligation in accordance with our term after the transaction our ability to meet our expense and debt service obligation contained in the agreement governing our indebtedness will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic and other factor including potential change in customer preference the success of product and marketing innovation and pressure from competitor should our sale decline after the transaction we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay our debt service obligation when due if we are unable to meet our debt service obligation after the transaction or should we fail to comply with our financial and other restrictive covenant contained in the agreement governing our indebtedness we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt sell important strategic asset at unfavorable price or borrow more money we may not be able to at any given time refinance our debt sell asset or borrow more money on term acceptable to or at all our inability to refinance our debt could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and result from operation after the transaction we may have difficulty attracting motivating and retaining executive and other employee in light of the transaction uncertainty about the effect of the transaction on our employee may have an adverse effect on this uncertainty may impair our ability to attract retain and motivate personnel until the transaction are completed employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the transaction employee may feel uncertain about their future role with after the transaction if our employee depart because of issue relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration our ability to realize the anticipated benefit of the transaction could be reduced similar challenge exist for in retaining employee being transferred to charter in the transaction and in attracting any additional personnel we may need after the transaction delay in the completion of the transaction may diminish the anticipated benefit of the transaction completion of the transaction is conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental consent and approval order authorization and ruling including the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period or extension thereof under the hsr act and the adoption of an order by the fcc granting it consent to the transfer of control or assignment of certain license and authorization issued by the fcc the requirement to receive these consent and approval order authorization and ruling the transaction could delay the completion of the transaction if for example government agency request additional information from the party in order to facilitate their review of the transaction or require any condition precedent to granting their approval of the transaction in addition these governmental agency may attempt to condition their approval of the transaction on the imposition of condition that could have material adverse effect on after the transaction including but not limited to our operating result or the value of charter class common stock any delay in the completion of the transaction could diminish the anticipated benefit of the transaction or result in additional transaction cost loss of revenue or other effect associated with uncertainty about the transaction any uncertainty over the ability of the company to complete the transaction could make it more difficult for and greatland connection to retain key employee or to pursue business strategy in addition until the transaction are completed the attention of our management may be diverted from ongoing business concern and regular business responsibility to the extent management is focused on matter relating to the transaction failure to complete the transaction could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial result if the transaction are not completed for any reason our ongoing business may be adversely affected and without realizing any of the benefit of having completed the transaction we would be subject to number of risk we may experience negative reaction from the financial market including negative impact on our stock price we may experience negative reaction from our customer regulator and employee we may be required to pay significant cost relating to the transaction and will have paid significant cost related to the transaction such interest on the billion of debt incurred to fund the transaction the transaction agreement place certain restriction on the conduct of our business with respect to our asset being transferred to comcast prior to completion of the transaction such restriction the waiver of which is subject to the consent of the other party in certain case not to be unreasonably withheld conditioned or delayed may have prevented from taking certain specified action or otherwise pursuing business opportunity during the pendency of the transaction and matter relating to the transaction including integration planning will require substantial commitment of time and resource by our management and expenditure which would otherwise have been devoted to day to day operation and other opportunity that may have been beneficial to in the absence of the transaction if the transaction are not completed the risk described above may materialize and they may adversely affect our business financial condition financial result and stock price in addition we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the transaction or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against to perform our obligation under the transaction agreement if the spin off doe not qualify tax free reorganization under section and of the code including result of subsequent acquisition of stock of greatland connection then comcast may recognize very substantial amount of taxable gain and greatland connection and in certain circumstance charter may be obligated to indemnify comcast for these tax the completion of the transaction is conditioned upon the receipt of opinion from counsel to the tax free nature of certain of the transaction including the spin off the opinion of counsel will be based on among other thing current law and certain assumption and representation to factual matter made by comcast greatland connection and charter any change in currently applicable law which may be retroactive or the failure of any representation to be true correct and complete could adversely affect the conclusion reached by counsel in the opinion moreover the opinion will not be binding on the internal revenue service irs or the court and the irs or the court may not agree with the conclusion reached in the opinion even if the spin off otherwise qualifies tax free spin off for federal income tax purpose the spin off will be taxable to comcast pursuant to section of the code if or more of the stock of either comcast or greatland connection is acquired directly or indirectly taking into account the stock of greatland connection acquired by new charter in the merger and the stock of comcast and greatland connection acquired by twc shareholder in the transaction between comcast and twc and in the spin off part of plan or series of related transaction that includes the spin off because greatland connection stockholder that are former comcast shareholder exclusive of former twc shareholder will own more than of the common stock of greatland connection following the merger the merger standing alone is not expected to cause the spin off to be taxable to comcast under section of the code however if the irs were to determine that other acquisition of greatland connection common stock or comcast common stock either before or after the spin off are part of plan or series of related transaction that includes the spin off such determination could result in the recognition of gain by comcast under section of the code if section of the code applied comcast might recognize very substantial amount of taxable gain the tax sharing agreement that will be entered into by comcast greatland connection and to limited extent new charter in certain circumstance and subject to certain limitation greatland connection will be required to indemnify comcast against tax on the spin off that arise result of certain action or failure to act by greatland connection or result of certain change in ownership of the stock of greatland connection after the completion of the transaction greatland connection will be unable to take certain action after the transaction because such action could adversely affect the tax free status of the spin off and such restriction could be significant if greatland connection is required to indemnify comcast in the event the spin off is taxable this indemnification obligation would be substantial and could have material adverse effect on greatland connection moreover under the tax sharing agreement in certain circumstance and subject to certain limitation new charter will be required to indemnify comcast against tax on the spin off that arise from new charter taking any action that would result in new charter holding greatland connection share in excess of the percentage of greatland connection share acquired in the merger during the two year period following the spin off if new charter is required to indemnify comcast in the event the spin off is taxable this indemnification obligation would be substantial and could have material adverse effect on new charter new charter and greatland connection will be unable to take certain action after the transaction because such action could adversely affect the tax free status of the spin off and such restriction could be significant the tax sharing agreement will prohibit new charter charter and greatland connection from taking action that could cause the spin off to be taxable to comcast in particular for two year after the completion of the transaction new charter and greatland connection will not be permitted to take action that would result in new charter holding or being treated holding greatland connection share in excess of the percentage of greatland connection share acquired by new charter in the merger these action could include entering into certain merger or consolidation transaction certain stock issuance and certain other desirable strategic transaction because of these restriction greatland connection may be limited in the amount of stock that it can issue to make acquisition or raise additional capital in the two year subsequent to the completion of the charter merger which could have material adverse effect on greatland connection liquidity and financial condition the tax sharing agreement will also provide that in certain circumstance and subject to certain limitation greatland connection and new charter will be required to indemnify comcast against tax on the spin off that arise result of action in violation of the prohibition and limitation described above if greatland connection or new charter is required to indemnify comcast in the event the spin off is taxable this indemnification obligation would be substantial and could have material adverse effect on greatland connection or new charter applicable we will incur significant transaction related cost in connection with the transaction we expect to incur number of non recurring cost associated with the transaction before at and after closing the transaction we also will incur transaction fee and cost related to formulating and implementing integration plan including facility and system implementation cost and employment related cost we continue to ass the magnitude of these cost and additional unanticipated cost may be incurred in the transaction and integration although we expect that the elimination of duplicative cost well the realization of other efficiency related to the integration of the business should allow to offset integration related cost over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all in addition if the transaction are not consummated we would bear some or all of these cost without the benefit of efficiency from the integration of the business such cost could have material adverse impact on our financial result sale of our common stock after the transaction may negatively affect the market price of new charter common stock the share of our common stock to be issued in the transaction to holder of greatland connection common stock initially the comcast shareholder will generally be eligible for immediate resale the market price of our common stock could decline result of sale of large number of share of our common stock in the market after the consummation of the transaction or even the perception that these sale could occur currently comcast shareholder may include index fund that have performance tied to the standard poor index or other stock index and institutional investor subject to various investing guideline because new charter may not be included in these index following the consummation of the transaction or may not meet the investing guideline of some of these institutional investor these index fund and institutional investor may decide to or may be required to sell the common stock that they receive the transaction these sale or the possibility that these sale may occur may also make it more difficult for new charter to obtain additional capital by selling equity security in the future at time and at price that it deems appropriate risk related to regulatory and legislative matter our business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation which could adversely affect our business regulation of the cable industry ha increased cable operator operational and administrative expense and limited their revenue cable operator are subject to various law and regulation including those covering the following the provisioning and marketing of cable equipment and compatibility with new digital technology subscriber and employee privacy and data security limited rate regulation of video service copyright royalty for retransmitting broadcast signal when cable system must carry particular broadcast station and when it must first obtain retransmission consent to carry broadcast station the provision of channel capacity to unaffiliated commercial leased access programmer limitation on our ability to enter into exclusive agreement with multiple dwelling unit complex and control our inside wiring the provision of high speed internet service including net neutrality rule the provision of voice communication cable franchise renewal and transfer equal employment opportunity emergency alert system disability access technical standard marketing practice customer service and consumer protection and approval for merger and acquisition often accompanied by the imposition of restriction and requirement on an applicant business in order to secure approval of the proposed transaction additionally many aspect of these law and regulation are often the subject of judicial proceeding and administrative or legislative proposal there are also ongoing effort to amend or expand the federal state and local regulation of some of the service offered over our cable system which may compound the regulatory risk we already face and proposal that might make it easier for our employee to unionize some state are considering adopting energy efficiency regulation governing the operation of equipment such broadband modem that we use to deliver internet service which could constrain innovation in broadband service and equipment congress is considering whether to rewrite the entire communication act to account for change in the communication marketplace congress and various federal agency are also considering more focused change such new privacy restriction and new restriction on the use of personal and profiling information for behavioral advertising in response to recent global data breach malicious activity and cyber threat well the general increasing concern regarding the protection of consumer personal information congress and various federal agency are also considering the adoption of new data security and cybersecurity legislation and regulation that could result in additional network and information security requirement for our business these new law well existing legal and regulatory obligation could affect our operation and require significant expenditure in addition federal state and local regulator could deny necessary approval of the transaction or impose additional regulatory condition in connection with their review of the transaction that could affect our operation our cable system franchise are subject to non renewal or termination the failure to renew franchise in one or more key market could adversely affect our business our cable system generally operate pursuant to franchise permit and similar authorization issued by state or local governmental authority controlling the public right of way many franchise establish comprehensive facility and service requirement well specific customer service standard and monetary penalty for non compliance in many case franchise are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with significant provision set forth in the franchise agreement governing system operation franchise are generally granted for fixed term and must be periodically renewed franchising authority may resist granting renewal if either past performance or the prospective operating proposal is considered inadequate franchise authority often demand concession or other commitment condition to renewal in some instance local franchise have not been renewed at expiration and we have operated and are operating under either temporary operating agreement or without franchise while negotiating renewal term with the local franchising authority the traditional cable franchising regime ha recently undergone significant change result of various federal and state action some state franchising law do not allow incumbent operator like to opt into favorable statewide franchising quickly entrant and often require to retain certain franchise obligation that are more burdensome than those applied to new entrant we can not assure you that we will be able to comply with all significant provision of our franchise agreement and certain of our franchisers have from time to time alleged that we have not complied with these agreement additionally although historically we have renewed our franchise without incurring significant cost we can not assure you that we will be able to renew or to renew favorably our franchise in the future termination of or sustained failure to renew franchise in one or more key market could adversely affect our business in the affected geographic area our cable system franchise are non exclusive accordingly local and state franchising authority can grant additional franchise and create additional competition for our product resulting in overbuilds which could adversely affect result of operation our cable system franchise are non exclusive consequently local and state franchising authority can grant additional franchise to competitor in the same geographic area or operate their own cable system in some case local government entity and municipal utility may legally compete with on more favorable term result competing operator may build system in area in which we hold franchise the fcc ha adopted rule that streamline entry for new competitor particularly those affiliated with telephone company and reduce franchising burden for these new entrant at the same time substantial number of state have adopted new franchising law principally designed to streamline entry for new competitor and often provide advantage for these new entrant that are not immediately available to existing operator broadband delivery of video content is not necessarily subject to the same franchising obligation applicable to our traditional cable system the fcc administers program that collect universal service fund contribution from telecommunication service provider and us them to subsidize the provision of telecommunication service in high cost area and to low income consumer and the provision of internet and telecommunication service to school library and certain health care provider variety of regulatory change may lead the fcc to expand the collection of universal service fund contribution to encompass internet service provider the fcc already ha begun to redirect the expenditure of some universal service funding to broadband deployment in way that could assist competitor in competing with our service local franchise authority have the ability to impose additional regulatory constraint on our business which could further increase our expense in addition to the franchise agreement cable authority in some jurisdiction have adopted cable regulatory ordinance that further regulate the operation of cable system this additional regulation increase the cost of operating our business local franchising authority may impose new and more restrictive requirement local franchising authority who are certified to regulate rate in the community where they operate generally have the power to reduce rate and order refund on the rate charged for basic service and equipment tax legislation and administrative initiative or challenge to our tax position could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition we operate cable system in location throughout the united state and result we are subject to the tax law and regulation of federal state and local government from time to time various legislative and or administrative initiative may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax position there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payment will not be adversely affected by these initiative certain state and locality have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional tax or fee on our service or changing the methodology or base on which certain fee and tax are computed the federal internet tax freedom act which prohibits many tax on internet access service will expire october unless it is renewed by congress potential change include additional tax or fee on our service which could impact our customer combined reporting and other change to general business tax central unit level assessment of property tax and other matter that could increase our income franchise sale use and or property tax liability in addition federal state and local tax law and regulation are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretation there can be no assurance that our tax position will not be challenged by relevant tax authority or that we would be successful in any such challenge regulation of the cable industry could impair our ability to raise rate to cover our increasing cost resulting in increased loss currently rate regulation of cable system is strictly limited to the basic service tier and associated equipment and installation activity however the fcc and congress continue to be concerned that cable rate increase are exceeding inflation it is possible that either the fcc or congress will further restrict the ability of cable system operator to implement rate increase for our video service or even for our high speed internet and voice service should this occur it would impede our ability to raise our rate if we are unable to raise our rate in response to increasing cost our loss would increase there ha been legislative and regulatory interest in requiring company that own multiple cable network to make each of them available on standalone rather than bundled basis to cable operator and in requiring cable operator to offer historically bundled programming service on an la carte basis to consumer while any new regulation or legislation designed to enable cable operator to purchase programming on standalone basis could be beneficial to charter any regulation or legislation that limit how we sell programming could adversely affect our business action by pole owner might subject to significantly increased pole attachment cost pole attachment are cable wire that are attached to utility pole cable system attachment to investor owned public utility pole historically have been regulated at the federal or state level generally resulting in favorable pole attachment rate for attachment used to provide cable service in contrast utility pole owned by municipality or cooperative are not subject to federal regulation and are generally exempt from state regulation in the fcc amended it pole attachment rule to promote broadband deployment the order overall strengthens the cable industry ability to access investor owned utility pole on reasonable rate term and condition it also allows for new penalty in certain case involving unauthorized attachment that could result in additional cost for cable operator the new rule were affirmed in future regulatory change in this area could impact the pole attachment rate we pay utility company increasing regulation of our internet service product could adversely affect our ability to provide new product and service on may the fcc initiated rulemaking to issue new network neutrality regulation potentially including reclassification of broadband service title ii common carrier service which could subject our service to far more extensive and burdensome federal and state regulation on february the chairman of the fcc released fact sheet describing his proposed new rule the chairman proposal reclassifies wireline and wireless broadband service title ii common carrier service the new rule would prohibit isps from engaging in blocking throttling and paid prioritization and the existing transparency rule compelling the disclosure of network management policy would be enhanced the fcc would also have authority under the proposed rule to hear complaint and take enforcement action if it determines that the interconnection of isps are not just and reasonable or if isps fail to meet new general obligation not to harm consumer or edge provider we do not know at the current time whether the regulation proposed by the chairman will be adopted by the full commission at meeting scheduled for february whether any rule adopted actually will go into effect or be struck down by legal appeal or how any new rule actually would be administered by the fcc but such rule could limit our ability to efficiently manage our cable system and respond to operational and competitive challenge change in channel carriage regulation could impose significant additional cost on cable operator also face significant regulation of their video channel carriage we can be required to devote substantial capacity to the carriage of programming that we might not carry voluntarily including certain local broadcast signal local public educational and governmental access peg programming and unaffiliated commercial leased access programming required channel capacity for use by person unaffiliated with the cable operator who desire to distribute programming over cable system the fcc adopted revised commercial leased access rule which would dramatically reduce the rate we can charge for leasing this capacity and dramatically increase our administrative burden but these remain stayed while under appeal legislation ha been introduced in congress in the past that if adopted could impact our carriage of broadcast signal by simultaneously eliminating the cable industry compulsory copyright license and the retransmission consent requirement governing cable retransmission of broadcast signal the fcc also continues to consider change to the rule affecting the relationship between programmer including broadcaster and multichannel video distributor future regulatory change could disrupt existing programming commitment interfere with our preferred use of limited channel capacity increase our programming cost and limit our ability to offer service that would maximize our revenue potential it is possible that other legal restraint will be adopted limiting our discretion over programming decision voice service is subject to regulatory burden which may increase causing to incur additional cost we offer voice communication service over our broadband network using voip service the fcc ha ruled that competitive telephone company that support voip service such those we offer our customer are entitled to interconnect with incumbent provider of traditional telecommunication service which ensures that our voip service can compete in the market the scope of these interconnection right are being reviewed in current fcc proceeding which may affect our ability to compete in the provision of voice service or result in additional cost the fcc ha also declared that certain voip service are not subject to traditional state public utility regulation the full extent of the fcc preemption of state and local regulation of voip service is not yet clear telecommunication company generally are subject to other significant regulation which could also be extended to voip provider if additional telecommunication regulation are applied to our voip service it could cause to incur additional cost the fcc ha already extended certain traditional telecommunication carrier requirement to many voip provider such including universal service fund collection calea privacy of customer proprietary network information number porting network outage reporting rural call completion reporting disability access and discontinuance of service requirement in november the fcc released an order significantly changing the rule governing intercarrier compensation payment for the origination and termination of telephone traffic between carrier including voip service provider like the united state court of appeal for the tenth circuit upheld the rule in may the new rule will result in substantial decrease in intercarrier compensation payment over multi year period we received intercarrier compensation of approximately million million and million for the year ended december and respectively item

and voice service including in some case wireless service and they also offer these service in bundle similar to ours customer have been more willing to consider our competitor product partially because of increased marketing highlighting perceived difference between competitive video product especially when those competitor are often offering significant incentive to switch provider some consumer have chosen to receive video over the internet rather than through pay television service including from thereby reducing our video revenue see part item business competition in the recent

policy and estimate certain of our accounting policy require our management to make difficult subjective and or complex judgment management ha discussed these policy with the audit committee of charter board of director and the audit committee ha reviewed the following disclosure we consider the following policy to be the most critical in understanding the estimate assumption and judgment that are involved in preparing our financial statement and the uncertainty that could affect our result of operation financial condition and cash flow property plant and equipment capitalization of labor and overhead cost valuation and impairment of property plant and equipment useful life of property plant and equipment intangible asset valuation and impairment of franchise valuation and

our financial statement that require estimate or judgment that are not deemed critical such the allowance for doubtful account and valuation of our derivative instrument but change in estimate or judgment in these other item could also have material impact on our financial statement property plant and equipmentthe cable industry is capital intensive and large portion of our resource are spent on capital activity associated with extending rebuilding and upgrading our cable network of december and the net carrying amount of our property plant and equipment consisting primarily of cable network asset wa approximately billion representing of total asset and billion representing of total asset respectively total capital expenditure for the year ended december and were approximately billion billion and billion respectively of labor and overhead cost cost associated with network construction initial customer installation installation refurbishment and the addition of network equipment necessary to provide new or advanced video service are capitalized while our capitalization is based on specific activity capitalized we track these cost by fixed asset category at the cable system level and not on specific asset basis for asset that are sold or retired we remove the estimated applicable cost and accumulated depreciation cost capitalized part of initial customer installation include material direct labor and certain indirect cost these indirect cost are associated with the activity of personnel who assist in connecting and activating the new service and consist of compensation and overhead cost associated with these support function the cost of disconnecting service at customer dwelling or reconnecting service to previously installed dwelling are charged to operating expense in the period incurred cost for repair and maintenance are charged to operating expense incurred while equipment replacement including replacement of certain component and betterment including replacement of cable drop from the pole to the dwelling are capitalized we make judgment regarding the installation and construction activity to be capitalized we capitalize direct labor and overhead using standard developed from actual cost and applicable operational data we calculate standard annually or more frequently if circumstance dictate for item such the labor rate overhead rate and the actual amount of time required to perform capitalizable activity for example the standard amount of time required to perform capitalizable activity are based on study of the time required to perform such activity overhead rate are established based on an analysis of the nature of cost incurred in support of capitalizable activity and determination of the portion of cost that is directly attributable to capitalizable activity the impact of change that resulted from these study were not material in the period presented labor cost directly associated with capital project are capitalized capitalizable activity performed in connection with customer installation include such activity dispatching truck roll to the customer dwelling or business for service connection verification of serviceability to the customer dwelling or business determining whether the customer dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable network and or receiving advanced or internet service customer premise activity performed by in house field technician and third party contractor in connection with customer installation installation of network equipment in connection with the installation of advanced service and equipment replacement and betterment and verifying the integrity of the customer network connection by initiating test signal downstream from the headend to the customer digital set top box judgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead cost incurred result from specific capital activity and therefore should be capitalized the primary cost that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are employee benefit and payroll tax associated with capitalized direct labor ii direct variable cost associated with capitalizable activity consisting primarily of installation and construction vehicle cost iii the cost of support personnel such dispatcher who directly assist with capitalizable installation activity and iv indirect cost directly attributable to capitalizable activity while we believe our existing capitalization policy are appropriate significant change in the nature or extent of our system activity could affect management judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future we monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policy and perform update to our internal study on an ongoing basis to determine whether fact or circumstance warrant change to our capitalization policy we capitalized internal direct labor and overhead of million million and million respectively for the year ended december and valuation and impairment we evaluate the recoverability of our property plant and equipment upon the occurrence of event or change in circumstance indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable such event or change in circumstance could include such factor the impairment of our indefinite life franchise change in technological advance fluctuation in the fair value of such asset adverse change in relationship with local franchise authority adverse change in market condition or deterioration of current or expected future operating result long lived asset is deemed impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flow associated with the asset no impairment of long lived asset to be held and used were recorded in the year ended december and we utilize the cost approach the primary method used to establish fair value for our property plant and equipment in connection with business combination the cost approach considers the amount required to replace an asset by constructing or purchasing new asset with similar utility then adjusts the value in consideration of all form of depreciation of the appraisal date for physical depreciation and function and economic obsolescence the cost approach relies on management assumption regarding current material and labor cost required to rebuild and repurchase significant component of our property plant and equipment along with assumption regarding the age and estimated useful life of our property plant and equipment life of property plant and equipment we evaluate the appropriateness of estimated useful life assigned to our property plant and equipment based on annual analysis of such useful life and revise such life to the extent warranted by changing fact and circumstance any change in estimated useful life result of this analysis are reflected prospectively beginning in the period in which the study is completed our analysis of useful life in did not indicate change in useful life the effect of one year decrease in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property plant and equipment of december would be an increase in annual depreciation expense of approximately million the effect of one year increase in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property plant and equipment of december would be decrease in annual depreciation expense of approximately million depreciation expense related to property plant and equipment totaled billion billion and billion for the year ended december and respectively representing approximately and of cost and expense respectively depreciation is recorded using the straight line composite method over management estimate of the useful life of the related asset listed below cable distribution system yearscustomer equipment and installation yearsvehicles and equipment yearsbuildings and leasehold improvement

asset and billion representing of total asset respectively for more information and complete discussion of how we test franchise asset for impairment see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statement contained in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data in and we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the franchise asset in each unit of accounting exceeds the carrying value of such asset and therefore did not perform quantitative analysis at our last quantitative assessment the fair value of franchise exceeded the book value for each unit of accounting by to valuation and impairment of goodwill the net carrying value of goodwill of december and wa approximately billion representing of total asset and billion representing of total asset respectively for more information and complete discussion on our valuation methodology see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statement contained in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data with our franchise impairment testing in and we elected to perform qualitative assessment for our goodwill impairment testing and concluded that our goodwill is not impaired valuation impairment and amortization of customer relationship the net carrying value of customer relationship of december and wa approximately billion representing of total asset and billion representing of total asset respectively amortization expense related to customer relationship for the year ended december and wa approximately million million and million respectively for more information and complete discussion on our valuation methodology see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statement contained in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data impairment of trademark the net carrying value of trademark of both december and wa approximately million and million respectively representing of total asset for both period for more information and complete discussion on our valuation methodology see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statement contained in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data the qualitative analysis in and did not identify any factor that would indicate that it wa more likely than not that the fair value of trademark were le than the carrying value and thus resulted in no impairment income tax all of charter operation are held through charter holdco and it direct and indirect subsidiary charter holdco and the majority of it subsidiary are generally limited liability company that are not subject to income tax however certain of these liability company are subject to state income tax in addition the indirect subsidiary that are corporation are subject to federal and state income tax all of the remaining taxable income gain loss deduction and credit of charter holdco pas through to charter and it direct subsidiary of december charter and it indirect corporate subsidiary had approximately billion of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in gross deferred tax asset of approximately billion federal tax net operating loss carryforwards expire in the year through these loss resulted from the operation of charter holdco and it subsidiary in addition of december charter and it indirect corporate subsidiary had state tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in gross deferred tax asset net of federal tax benefit of approximately million state tax net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in the year through due to uncertainty in projected future taxable income valuation allowance have been established against the gross deferred tax asset for book accounting purpose except for future taxable income that will result from the reversal of existing temporary difference for which deferred tax liability are recognized such tax loss carryforwards can accumulate and be used to offset charter future taxable income of december billion of federal tax loss carryforwards are unrestricted and available for charter immediate use while approximately billion of federal tax loss carryforwards are still subject to section and other restriction pursuant to these restriction charter estimate that approximately billion and million in the year and respectively and an additional million annually over each of the next eight year of federal tax loss carryforwards should become unrestricted and available for charter use both charter indirect corporate subsidiary and state tax loss carryforwards are subject to similar but varying restriction in addition to it tax loss carryforwards charter also ha tax basis of billion in intangible asset and billion in property plant and equipment of december the tax basis in these asset is not subject to section limitation and therefore is currently deductible depreciated or amortized for illustrative purpose charter expects to reflect tax deductible amortization and depreciation on asset owned of december beginning at approximately billion in and billion between through decelerating annually the foregoing projected deduction do not include any amortization or depreciation related to future capital spend or potential acquisition in addition the deduction assume charter doe not dispose of material portion of it business or make modification to the underlying partnership it owns all of which may materially affect the timing or amount of it existing amortization and depreciation deduction any one of these factor including pending transaction future legislation or adjustment by the irs upon examination could also affect the projected deduction of december and we have recorded net deferred income tax liability of billion and billion respectively net deferred tax liability included approximately million and million at december and respectively relating to certain indirect subsidiary of charter holdco that file separate federal or state income tax return the remainder of our net deferred tax liability arose from charter investment in charter holdco and wa largely attributable to the characterization of franchise for financial reporting purpose indefinite lived part of our net liability on december and we had gross deferred tax asset of billion and billion respectively which primarily relate to tax loss allocated to charter from charter holdco in assessing the realizability of deferred tax asset management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will be realized due to our history of loss and limitation imposed by section of the code discussed above we were unable to assume future taxable income in our analysis and accordingly valuation allowance have been established except for deferred benefit available to offset certain deferred tax liability that will reverse over time accordingly our gross deferred tax asset have been offset with corresponding valuation allowance of billion and billion at december and respectively the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable and therefore reflected in the consolidated balance sheet would be increased at such time that it is more likely than not future taxable income will be realized during the carryforward period we periodically evaluate the fact and circumstance surrounding this assessment and at the time this consideration is met an adjustment to reverse some portion of the existing valuation allowance would result in determining our tax provision for financial reporting purpose charter establishes reserve for uncertain tax position unless such position are determined to be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination based on their technical merit in evaluating whether tax position ha met the more likely than not recognition threshold we presume the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that ha full knowledge of all relevant information tax position that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statement the tax position is measured the largest amount of benefit that ha greater than likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved there is considerable judgment involved in determining whether position taken on the tax return are more likely than not of being sustained charter adjusts it uncertain tax reserve estimate periodically because of ongoing examination by and settlement with the various taxing authority well change in tax law regulation and interpretation tax year for charter or charter holdco for income tax purpose are currently under examination by the irs tax year ending through remain subject to examination and assessment year prior to remain open solely for purpose of examination of charter loss and credit carryforwards litigationlegal contingency have high degree of uncertainty when loss from contingency becomes estimable and probable reserve is established the reserve reflects management best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised fact and circumstance change reserve is released when matter is ultimately brought to closure or the statute of limitation lapse we have established reserve for certain matter although certain matter are not expected individually to have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition result of operation or liquidity such matter could have in the aggregate material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition result of operation or liquidity programming agreement we exercise significant judgment in estimating programming expense associated with certain video programming contract our policy is to record video programming cost based on our contractual agreement with our programming vendor which are generally multi year agreement that provide for to make payment to the programming vendor at agreed upon market rate based on the number of customer to which we provide the programming service if programming contract expires prior to the party entry into new agreement and we continue to distribute the service we estimate the programming cost during the period there is no contract in place in so we consider the previous contractual rate inflation and the status of the negotiation in determining our estimate when the programming contract term are finalized an adjustment to programming expense is recorded if necessary to reflect the term of the new contract we also make estimate in the recognition of programming expense related to other item such the accounting for free period timing of rate increase and credit from service interruption well the allocation of consideration exchanged between the party in multiple element transaction significant judgment is also involved when we enter into agreement that result in receiving cash consideration from the programming vendor usually in the form of advertising sale channel positioning fee launch support or marketing support in these situation we must determine based upon fact and circumstance if such cash consideration should be recorded revenue reduction in programming expense or reduction in another expense category marketing of operation the following table set forth the percentage of revenue

in programming cost is primarily result of annual contractual rate adjustment including increase in amount paid for retransmission consent broader carriage of certain network result of our all digital initiative and the introduction of new network to charter video offering we expect programming expense to continue to increase due to variety of factor including annual increase imposed by programmer with additional selling power result of medium consolidation increased demand by owner of broadcast station for payment for retransmission consent or linking carriage of other service to retransmission consent and additional programming particularly new sport service we have been unable to fully pas these increase on to our customer nor do we expect to be able to do so in the future without potential loss of customer cost to service customer include residential and commercial cost related to field operation network operation and customer care including internal and third party labor for installation service and repair maintenance billing and collection occupancy and vehicle cost the increase in cost to service customer wa primarily the result of higher spending on labor to

liability related to indefinite lived asset by million our tax provision in future period will vary based on various factor including change in our deferred tax liability attributable to indefinite lived intangible well future operating result however we do not anticipate having such large reduction in income tax expense attributable to these item unless we enter into restructuring transaction or similar future financing the ultimate impact on the tax provision of such future financing and restructuring activity if any will be dependent on the underlying fact and circumstance at the time net loss we incurred net loss of million million and million for the year ended december and respectively primarily result of the factor described above loss per common share during and net loss per

various aspect of our business adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are non gaap financial measure and should be considered in addition to not substitute for net loss and net cash flow from operating activity reported in accordance with gaap these term defined by may not be comparable to similarly titled measure used by other company adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are reconciled to net loss and net cash flow from operating activity respectively below adjusted ebitda is defined net loss plus net interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization stock compensation expense loss on extinguishment of debt gain loss on derivative instrument net and other operating expense such merger and acquisition cost special charge and gain loss on sale or retirement of asset such it eliminates the significant non cash depreciation and amortization expense that result from the capital intensive nature of our business well other non cash or special item and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activity adjusted ebitda is used by management and charter board of director to evaluate the performance of our business however this measure is limited in that it doe not reflect periodic cost of certain capitalized tangible and intangible asset used in generating revenue and our cash cost of financing management evaluates these cost through other financial measure free cash flow is defined net cash flow from operating activity le capital expenditure and change in accrued expense related to capital expenditure we believe that adjusted ebitda and free cash flow provide information useful to investor in assessing our performance and our ability to service our debt fund operation and make additional investment with internally generated fund in addition adjusted ebitda generally correlate to the leverage ratio calculation under our credit facility or outstanding note to determine compliance with the covenant contained in the facility and note all

the future economic benefit of the right to solicit and service potential customer customer marketing right and the right to deploy and market new service to potential customer service marketing right management estimate the fair value of franchise right at the date of acquisition and determines if the franchise ha finite life or an indefinite life all franchise that qualify for indefinite life treatment are tested for impairment annually or more frequently warranted by event or change in circumstance in determining whether our franchise have an indefinite life the company considered the likelihood of franchise renewal the expected cost of franchise renewal and the technological state of the associated cable system with view to whether or not it is in compliance with any technology upgrading requirement specified in franchise agreement the company ha concluded that of december and all of it franchise qualify for indefinite life treatment franchise asset are aggregated into essentially inseparable unit of accounting to conduct valuation the unit of accounting generally represent geographical clustering of our cable system into group the company ass qualitative factor to determine whether the existence of event or circumstance lead to determination that it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset ha been impaired if after this qualitative assessment the company determines that it is not more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset ha been impaired then no further quantitative testing is necessary in completing the impairment testing the company evaluated the impact of various factor to the expected future cash flow attributable to it unit of accounting and to the assumed discount rate which would be used to present value those cash flow such factor included macro economic and industry condition including the capital market regulatory and competitive environment and cost of programming and customer premise equipment along with change to our organizational structure and strategy after consideration of these qualitative factor the company concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the franchise communication inc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statementsdecember and dollar in million except share or per share data or where indicated asset in each unit of accounting exceeds the carrying value of such asset and therefore did not perform quantitative analysis in or if the company is required to perform quantitative analysis to test it franchise asset for impairment the company determines the estimated fair value utilizing an income approach model based on the present value of the estimated discrete future cash flow attributable to each of the intangible asset identified assuming discount rate the fair value of franchise for impairment testing is determined based on estimated discrete discounted future cash flow using assumption consistent with internal forecast the franchise after tax cash flow is calculated the after tax cash flow generated by the potential customer obtained le the anticipated customer churn and the new service added to those customer in future period the sum of the present value of the franchise after tax cash flow in year through and the continuing value of the after tax cash flow beyond year yield the fair value of the franchise this approach make use of unobservable factor such projected revenue expense capital expenditure and discount rate applied to the estimated cash flow the determination of the discount rate is based on weighted average cost of capital approach which us market participant cost of equity and after tax cost of debt and reflects the risk inherent in the cash flow the company estimate discounted future cash flow using reasonable and appropriate assumption including among others penetration rate for video high speed internet and voice revenue growth rate operating margin and capital expenditure the assumption are based on the company and it peer historical operating performance adjusted for current and expected competitive and economic factor surrounding the cable industry the estimate and assumption made in the company valuation are inherently subject to significant uncertainty many of which are beyond it control and there is no assurance that these result can be achieved the primary assumption for which there is reasonable possibility of the occurrence of variation that would significantly affect the measurement value include the assumption regarding revenue growth programming expense growth rate the amount and timing of capital expenditure and the discount rate utilized goodwill is tested for impairment of november of each year or more frequently warranted by event or change in circumstance accounting guidance also permit qualitative assessment for goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of reporting unit exceeds it fair value if after this qualitative assessment the company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount then no further quantitative testing would be necessary if the company is required to perform the two step test under the accounting guidance the first step involves comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to it carrying amount if the estimated fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step of the goodwill impairment is not necessary if the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds it estimated fair value then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed and comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared to it carrying amount to determine the amount of impairment if any the fair value of the reporting unit when performing the second step of the goodwill impairment test is determined using consistent income approach model that used for franchise impairment testing with the company franchise impairment testing the company elected to perform qualitative assessment for it goodwill impairment testing in and and concluded that goodwill is not impaired customer relationship for valuation purpose represent the value of the business relationship with existing customer le the anticipated customer churn and are calculated by projecting the discrete future after tax cash flow from these customer including the right to deploy and market additional service to these customer the present value of these after tax cash flow yield the fair value of the customer relationship the use of different valuation assumption or definition of franchise or customer relationship such our inclusion of the value of selling additional service to our current customer within customer relationship versus franchise could significantly impact our valuation and any resulting impairment customer relationship are amortized on an accelerated method over useful life of year based on the period over which current customer are expected to generate cash flow customer relationship are evaluated for impairment upon the occurrence of event or change in circumstance indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable customer
