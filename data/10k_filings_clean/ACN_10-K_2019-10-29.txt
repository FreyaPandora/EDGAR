material impact on the equity ownership position of accenture of contentsitem risk factor in addition to the other information set forth in this report should carefully consider the following factor which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition result of operation including revenue and profitability and or stock price our business is also subject to general risk and uncertainty that may broadly affect company including additional risk and uncertainty not currently known to or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business financial condition result of operation and or stock price our result of operation could be adversely affected by volatile negative or uncertain economic and political condition and the effect of these condition on our client business and level of business activity global macroeconomic and geopolitical condition affect our client business and the market they serve volatile negative or uncertain economic and political condition in our significant market have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant market or in other market which are increasingly interdependent and cause our client to reduce or defer their spending on new initiative and technology or may result in client reducing delaying or eliminating spending under existing contract with which would negatively affect our business growth in the market we serve could be at slow rate or could stagnate or contract in each case for an extended period of time differing economic condition and pattern of economic growth and contraction in the geographical region in which we operate and the industry we serve have affected and may in the future affect demand for our service and solution we operate globally and have significant business in many market an economic slowdown in any of those market could adversely affect our result of operation ongoing economic and political volatility and uncertainty and changing demand pattern affect our business in number of other way including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plan particularly in consulting economic and political volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effect and change in demand pattern resulting from these and other factor to manifest themselves in our business and result of operation changing demand pattern from economic and political volatility and uncertainty including result of the united kingdom referendum in favor of exiting the european union change in global trade policy trade dispute and trend such populism and economic nationalism and their impact on our client and the industry we serve could have significant negative impact on our result of operation our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing profitable client demand for our service and solution including through the adaptation and expansion of our service and solution in response to ongoing change in technology and offering and significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our result of operation our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our service and solution with favorable margin which could be negatively affected by numerous factor many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product described above volatile negative or uncertain global economic and political condition and lower growth in the market we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our service and solution our success depends in part on our ability to continue to develop and implement service and solution that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing change in technology and offering to serve the evolving need of our client example of area of significant change include digital cloud and security related offering which are continually evolving well development in area such artificial intelligence augmented reality automation blockchain internet of thing quantum computing and service solution technological development may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our client and in the case of service solution could affect the nature of how we generate revenue some of these technology have reduced and replaced some of our historical service and solution and may continue to do so in the future this ha caused and may in the future cause client to delay spending under existing contract and engagement and to delay entering into new contract while they evaluate new technology such delay can negatively impact our result of operation if the pace and level of spending on new technology is not sufficient to make any shortfall development in the industry we serve which may be rapid also could shift demand to new service and solution if result of new technology or change in the industry we serve our client demand new service and solution we may be le competitive in these new area or need to make significant investment to meet that demand our growth strategy focus on responding to these type of development by driving innovation that will enable to expand our business into new growth area if we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry development or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale or if we do not make the right strategic investment to respond to these development and successfully drive innovation our service and of contentssolutions our result of operation and our ability to develop and maintain competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be negatively affected we operate in rapidly evolving environment in which currently are and we expect will continue to be new technology entrant new service or technology offered by competitor or new entrant may make our offering le differentiated or le competitive compared to other alternative which may adversely affect our result of operation in addition company in the industry we serve sometimes seek to achieve economy of scale and other synergy by combining with or acquiring other company if one of our current client merges or consolidates with company that relies on another provider for the service and solution we offer we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunity from the merger or consolidation in particular operating group business industry or geography small number of client have contributed or may in the future contribute significant portion of the revenue of such operating group business industry or geography and any decision by such client to delay reduce or eliminate spending on our service and solution could have disproportionate impact on the result of operation in the relevant operating group business industry and or geography many of our consulting contract are le than month in duration and these contract typically permit client to terminate the agreement with little day notice longer term larger and more complex contract such the majority of our outsourcing contract generally require longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our cost or make up for anticipated ongoing revenue and profit lost upon termination of the contract many of our contract allow client to terminate delay reduce or eliminate spending on the service and solution we provide additionally client could choose not to retain for additional stage of project try to renegotiate the term of it contract or cancel or delay additional planned work when contract are terminated or not renewed we lose the anticipated revenue and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenue lost consequently our result of operation in subsequent period could be materially lower than expected the specific business or financial condition of client change in management and change in client strategy are also all factor that can result in termination cancellation or delay if we are unable to keep our supply of skill and resource in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professional with strong leadership skill our business the utilization rate of our professional and our result of operation may be materially adversely affected our success is dependent in large part on our ability to keep our supply of market leading skill and capability in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skill to lead our business globally we must hire or reskill retain and motivate appropriate number of talented people with diverse skill in order to serve client across the globe respond quickly to rapid and ongoing change in technology industry and the macroeconomic environment and continuously innovate to grow our business for example if we are unable to hire or retrain our employee to keep pace with the rapid and continuous change in technology and the industry we serve or change in the type of service and solution client are demanding we may not be able to innovate and deliver new service and solution to fulfill client demand there is intense competition for scarce talent with market leading skill and capability in new technology and our competitor have directly targeted our employee with these highly sought after skill and may continue to do so result we may be unable to cost effectively hire and retain employee with these market leading skill which may cause to incur increased cost or be unable to fulfill client demand for our service and solution we are particularly dependent on retaining member of accenture leadership with critical capability if we are unable to do so our ability to innovate generate new business opportunity and effectively lead large and complex transformation and client relationship could be jeopardized we depend on identifying developing and retaining top talent to innovate and lead our business this includes developing talent and leadership capability in emerging market the depth of skilled employee may be limited and competition for these resource is intense our ability to expand in our key market depends in large part on our ability to attract develop retain and integrate both leader for the local business and people with critical capability similarly our profitability depends on our ability to effectively source and staff people with the right mix of skill and experience to perform service for our client including our ability to transition employee to new assignment on timely basis if we are unable to effectively deploy our employee globally on timely basis to fulfill the need of our client our profitability could suffer if the utilization rate of our professional is high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition the quality of the work performed well our ability to staff project if our utilization rate is too low our profitability and the engagement of our employee could suffer the cost associated with recruiting and training employee are significant an important element of our global business model is the deployment of our employee around the world which allows to move talent needed therefore if we are not of contentsable to deploy the talent we need because of increased regulation of immigration or work visa including limitation placed on the number of visa granted limitation on the type of work performed or location in which the work can be performed and new or higher minimum salary requirement it could be more difficult to staff our employee on client engagement and could increase our cost our equity based incentive compensation plan are designed to reward high performing individual for their contribution and provide incentive for them to remain with if the anticipated value of such incentive doe not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or if our total compensation package is not viewed competitive our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected in addition if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity award under our share plan in the amount we believe are necessary our ability to attract and retain personnel could be negatively affected there is risk that at certain point in time and in certain geographical region we will find it difficult to hire and retain sufficient number of employee with the skill or background to meet current and or future demand in these case we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractor to fill certain labor need and if not done effectively our profitability could be negatively impacted additionally if demand for our service and solution were to escalate at high rate we may need to adjust our compensation practice which could put upward pressure on our cost and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased cost at certain time however we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill set or geography or at compensation level that are not aligned with skill set in these situation we have engaged and may in the future engage in action to rebalance our resource including reducing the rate of new hire and increasing involuntary termination mean to keep our supply of skill and resource in balance with client demand if we are not successful in these initiative our result of operation could be adversely affected we could face legal reputational and financial risk if we fail to protect client and or accenture data from security breach or cyberattacks we are dependent on information technology network and system to securely process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our location around the world and with our people client alliance partner and vendor the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow including result of the use of mobile technology social medium and cloud based service the risk of security breach and cyberattacks increase such breach could lead to shutdown or disruption of or damage to our system and those of our client alliance partner and vendor and unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information including personal data in the past we have experienced data security breach resulting from unauthorized access to our and our service provider system which to date have not had material impact on our operation however there is no assurance that such impact will not be material in the future in providing service and solution to client we often manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or accenture data including personal data and we expect these activity to increase including through the use of artificial intelligence the internet of thing and analytics unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or accenture data whether through system failure employee negligence fraud misappropriation or other intentional or unintentional act could damage our reputation cause to lose client and could result in significant financial exposure similarly unauthorized access to or through our or our service provider information system or those we develop for our client whether by our employee or third party including cyberattack by computer programmer hacker member of organized crime and or state sponsored organization who continuously develop and deploy virus ransomware or other malicious software program or social engineering attack could result in negative publicity significant remediation cost legal liability damage to our reputation and government sanction and could have material adverse effect on our result of operation cybersecurity threat are constantly expanding and evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending them and maintaining effective security measure and protocol we are subject to numerous law and regulation designed to protect this information such the european union general data protection regulation gdpr various federal and state law governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information and data privacy and cybersecurity law in other region these law and regulation continue to evolve are increasing in complexity and number and increasingly conflict among the various country in which we operate which ha resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for the gdpr imposes new compliance obligation regarding the handling of personal data and ha significantly increased financial penalty for noncompliance for example failure to comply with the gdpr may lead to regulatory enforcement action which can result in monetary penalty of up to of worldwide revenue order to discontinue certain data processing operation private lawsuit or reputational damage if any person including any of our employee negligently disregard or intentionally breach our established control with respect to client or accenture data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to significant litigation monetary damage regulatory of contentsenforcement action fine and or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdiction these monetary damage might not be subject to contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damage and could be significant in addition our liability insurance which includes cyber insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover against claim related to security breach cyberattacks and other related breach the market in which we operate are highly competitive and we might not be able to compete effectively the market in which we offer our service and solution are highly competitive our competitor include large multinational provider including the service arm of large global technology provider that offer some or all of the service and solution that we do off shore service provider in lower cost location particularly in india that offer service globally that are similar to the service and solution we offer accounting firm that provide consulting and other service and solution in area that compete with solution or service provider that compete with in specific geographic market industry segment or service area including digital and advertising agency and emerging start ups and other company that can scale rapidly to focus on or disrupt certain market and provide new or alternative product service or delivery model and in house department of large corporation that use their own resource rather than engage an outside firm for the type of service and solution we provide some competitor may have greater financial marketing or other resource than we do and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professional may be able to innovate and provide new service and solution faster than we can or may be able to anticipate the need for service and solution we do even if we have potential offering that address marketplace or client need competitor may be more successful at selling similar service they offer including to company that are our client some competitor are more established in certain market and that may make executing our growth strategy to expand in these market more challenging additionally competitor may also offer more aggressive contractual term which may affect our ability to win work our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully and expand in the market we currently serve if we are unable to compete successfully we could lose market share and client to competitor which could materially adversely affect our result of operation in addition we may face greater competition due to consolidation of company in the technology sector through strategic merger or acquisition consolidation activity may result in new competitor with greater scale broader footprint or offering that are more attractive than over time our access to certain technology product and service may be reduced result of this consolidation the technology company described above including many of our alliance partner are increasingly able to offer service related to their software platform and other solution or are developing software platform and other solution that require integration service to lesser extent these more integrated service and solution may represent more attractive alternative to client than some of our service and solution which may materially adversely affect our competitive position and our result of operation change in our level of tax well audit investigation and tax proceeding or change in tax law or in their interpretation or enforcement could have material adverse effect on our effective tax rate result of operation cash flow and financial condition we are subject to tax in numerous jurisdiction we calculate and provide for tax in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate tax accounting often involves complex matter and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income tax and other tax liability we are subject to ongoing audit investigation and tax proceeding in various jurisdiction tax authority have disagreed and may in the future disagree with our judgment and are taking increasingly aggressive position opposing the judgment we make including with respect to our intercompany transaction we regularly ass the likely outcome of our audit investigation and tax proceeding to determine the appropriateness of our tax liability however our judgment might not be sustained result of these audit investigation and tax proceeding and the amount ultimately paid could be materially different from the amount previously recorded in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by challenge to our intercompany transaction change in the valuation of deferred tax asset and liability and change in tax law or in their interpretation or enforcement change in the mix of earnings in country with differing statutory tax rate the expiration of current tax benefit and change in accounting principle including the generally accepted accounting principle tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we operate may change materially result of shifting economic condition of contentsand tax policy in addition change in tax law treaty or regulation or their interpretation or enforcement have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent which could materially adversely affect our tax position number of country where we do business including the united state and many country in the european union have implemented and are considering implementing change in relevant tax accounting and other law regulation and interpretation for example in december the enacted the tax cut and job act the tax act which significantly changed tax law the tax act base erosion and anti abuse tax provision and regulation issued thereunder adversely impact our effective tax rate by limiting our ability to deduct certain expense the overall tax environment ha made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporation to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdiction for example the european commission ha been conducting investigation focusing on whether local country tax ruling or tax legislation provide preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rule furthermore the organization for economic co operation and development oecd which represents coalition of member country is supporting change to numerous long standing tax principle through it base erosion and profit shifting project which is focused on number of issue including the shifting of profit among affiliated entity located in different tax jurisdiction the change recommended by the oecd have been or are being adopted by many of the country in which we do business in addition the european commission ha expanded upon the oecd guideline with anti tax avoidance directive to be applied by it member state among other thing the directive require company to provide increased country by country disclosure of their financial information to tax authority which in turn could lead to disagreement by jurisdiction over the proper allocation of profit them in connection with the oecd base erosion and profit shifting project the oecd ha undertaken new project focused on addressing the tax challenge of the digitalization of the economy this project may impact all multinational business by implementing global model for minimum taxation additionally the european commission and some foreign jurisdiction have introduced proposal to impose separate tax on specified digital service activity there is significant uncertainty regarding such proposal the increasingly complex global tax environment and any unfavorable resolution of these uncertainty could have material adverse effect on our effective tax rate result of operation cash flow and financial condition although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the united state and ireland legislative or diplomatic action could be taken or the treaty may be amended in such way that would prevent from being able to rely on such treaty our inability to rely on the treaty would subject to increased taxation or significant additional expense in addition congressional proposal could change the definition of person for federal income tax purpose which could also subject to increased taxation in addition we could be materially adversely affected by future change in tax law or policy or in their interpretation or enforcement in ireland or other jurisdiction where we operate including their treaty with ireland or the united state these change could be exacerbated by economic budget or other challenge facing ireland or these other jurisdiction our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our service and solution if we are unable to remain competitive if our cost management strategy are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiency our profitability is highly dependent on variety of factor and could be materially impacted by any of the following our result of operation could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to meet our profitability expectation if we are not able to obtain favorable pricing for our service and solution our revenue and profitability could materially suffer the rate we are able to charge for our service and solution are affected by number of factor including general economic and political condition our client desire to reduce their cost the competitive environment in our industry our ability to accurately estimate our service delivery cost upon which our pricing is sometimes determined includes our ability to estimate the impact of inflation and foreign exchange on our service delivery cost over long term contract and the procurement practice of client and their use of third party advisor our profitability could suffer if we are not able to remain competitive the competitive environment in our industry affect our ability to secure new contract at our target economics in number of way any of which could have material negative impact on our result of operation the le we are able to differentiate our service and solution and or clearly convey the value of our service and solution the more risk we have in winning new work in sufficient volume and at our target pricing and overall economics in addition the introduction of new service or product by competitor could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing and impact our overall economics for the of contentsservices or solution we offer competitor may be willing at time to price contract lower than in an effort to enter the market or increase market share our profitability could suffer if our cost management strategy are unsuccessful and we may not be able to improve our profitability our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our cost including taking action to reduce certain cost our cost management strategy include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our service and solution and the workforce needed to deliver them if we are not effective in managing our operating cost in response to change in demand or pricing or if we are unable to cost effectively hire and retain personnel with the knowledge and skill necessary to deliver our service and solution particularly in area of new technology and offering and in the right geographic location we may incur increased cost which could reduce our ability to continue to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rate of growth and our desired level of profitability if we do not accurately anticipate the cost risk and complexity of performing our work or if third party upon we rely do not meet their commitment our contract could have delivery inefficiency and be le profitable than expected or unprofitable our contract profitability is highly dependent on our forecast regarding the effort and cost necessary to deliver our service and solution which are based on available data and could turn to be materially inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the effort cost or timing for meeting our contractual commitment and or completing engagement to client satisfaction our contract could yield lower profit margin than planned or be unprofitable similarly if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulty due to our management the failure of third party or our client to meet their commitment or for any other reason our contract could yield lower profit margin than planned or be unprofitable in particular large and complex arrangement often require that we utilize subcontractor or that our service and solution incorporate or coordinate with the software system or infrastructure requirement of other vendor and service provider including company with which we have alliance our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractor vendor and service provider to deliver their product and service in timely manner and in accordance with the project requirement well on our effective oversight of their performance in some case these subcontractor are small firm and they might not have the resource or experience to successfully integrate their service or product with large scale engagement or enterprise some of this work involves new technology which may not work intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted in addition certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structure and alliance some of which require to assume responsibility for the performance of third party whom we do not control any of these factor could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject to additional liability which could have material adverse effect on our relationship with client and on our result of operation our result of operation could be materially adversely affected by fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate although we report our result of operation in dollar majority of our revenue is denominated in currency other than the dollar unfavorable fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate have had an adverse effect and could in the future have material adverse effect on our result of operation because our consolidated financial statement are presented in dollar we must translate revenue expense and income well asset and liability into dollar at exchange rate in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore change in the value of the dollar against other currency will affect our revenue operating income and the value of balance sheet item including intercompany payable and receivables originally denominated in other currency these change cause our growth stated in dollar to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other period our currency hedging program which are designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the change in value of certain balance sheet item might not be successful additionally some transaction and balance may be denominated in currency for which there is no available market to hedge we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of our expense are incurred in currency other than those in which we bill for the related service an increase in the value of certain currency such the indian rupee or philippine peso against the currency in which our revenue is recorded could increase cost for delivery of service at off shore site by increasing labor and other cost that are denominated in local currency our contractual provision or cost management effort might not be able to offset their impact and our currency hedging activity which are designed to partially offset this impact might not be successful this could result in decrease in the profitability of our contract that are utilizing delivery center resource in addition our currency hedging activity are themselves subject to risk these include risk related to counterparty performance under hedging contract risk related to ineffective hedge and risk related to currency fluctuation we also face risk that extreme economic condition political instability or hostility or disaster of the type described below could impact or perhaps eliminate of contentsthe underlying exposure that we are hedging such an event could lead to loss being recognized on the currency hedge then in place that are not offset by anticipated change in the underlying hedge exposure result of our geographically diverse operation and our growth strategy to continue to expand in our key market around the world we are more susceptible to certain risk we have office and operation in more than city in country around the world one aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand in our key market around the world our growth strategy might not be successful if we are unable to manage the risk of our global operation and growth strategy including the concentration of our global delivery capability in india and the philippine international hostility terrorist activity natural disaster and security or data breach failure to maintain compliance with our client control requirement and multiple legal and regulatory system our result of operation and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected in addition emerging market generally involve greater financial and operational risk such those described below than our more mature market negative or uncertain political climate in country or geography where we operate could also adversely affect our global delivery capability is concentrated in india and the philippine which may expose to operational risk our business model is dependent on our global delivery capability which includes accenture personnel based at more than delivery center around the world while these delivery center are located throughout the world we have based large portion of our delivery capability in india where we have the largest number of people located in our delivery center and the philippine where we have the second largest number of people located concentrating our global delivery capability in these location present number of operational risk including those listed in the following paragraph many of which are beyond our control our business continuity and disaster recovery plan may not be effective particularly if catastrophic event occur if any of these circumstance occurs we have greater risk that interruption in communication with our client and other accenture location and personnel and any time in important process we operate for client could result in material adverse effect on our result of operation and our reputation in the marketplace international hostility terrorist activity natural disaster pandemic and infrastructure disruption could prevent from effectively serving our client and thus adversely affect our result of operation act of terrorist violence political unrest regional and international hostility and international response to these hostility natural disaster volcanic eruption sea level rise flood drought and the increasing frequency and severity of adverse weather condition health emergency or pandemic or the threat of or perceived potential for these event and other act of god could have negative impact on these event could adversely affect our client level of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant change in regional and global economic condition and cycle these event also pose significant risk to our people and to physical facility and operation around the world whether the facility are ours or those of our alliance partner supplier or client by disrupting communication and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel these type of event impact our ability to deliver our service and solution to our client extended disruption of electricity other public utility or network service at our facility well physical infrastructure damage to system failure at cyberattacks on or security breach in our facility or system could also adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and serve our client we might be unable to protect our people facility and system against all such occurrence we generally do not have insurance for loss and interruption caused by terrorist attack conflict and war if these disruption prevent from effectively serving our client our result of operation could be adversely affected we could be subject to strict restriction on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currency in some country we could be subject to strict restriction on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currency which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operation and expose to more extreme currency fluctuation this risk could increase we continue to expand in our key market around the world which include emerging market that are more likely to impose these restriction than more established market our global operation expose to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirement and violation of these regulation could harm our business we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regime on matter diverse anticorruption import export control content requirement trade restriction tariff taxation sanction immigration internal and disclosure control obligation security regulation anti competition anti money laundering data privacy and protection government compliance wage and hour standard and employment and labor relation the global nature of our operation including emerging market where legal system may be le developed or understood by and the diverse nature of our operation across number of regulated industry further increase the difficulty of compliance compliance with diverse legal requirement is costly time consuming and requires significant resource violation of one or more of these regulation in the conduct of our business could result in significant fine enforcement action or criminal sanction against and or our employee prohibition on business and damage to our reputation violation of these regulation in connection with the of contentsperformance of our obligation to our client also could result in liability for significant monetary damage fine enforcement action and or criminal prosecution or sanction unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage and restriction on our ability to effectively carry out our contractual obligation and thereby expose to potential claim from our client due to the varying degree of development of the legal system of the country in which we operate local law may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our right in particular in many part of the world including country in which we operate and or seek to expand practice in the local business community might not conform to international business standard and could violate anticorruption law or regulation including the foreign corrupt practice act and the uk bribery act our employee subcontractor vendor agent alliance or joint venture partner the company we acquire and their employee subcontractor vendor and agent and other third party with which we associate could take action that violate policy or procedure designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption law or regulation violation of these law or regulation by our employee or any of these third party could subject to criminal or civil enforcement action whether or not we participated or knew about the action leading to the violation including fine or penalty disgorgement of profit and suspension or disqualification from work including federal contracting any of which could materially adversely affect our business including our result of operation and our reputation change in law and regulation could also mandate significant and costly change to the way we implement our service and solution or could impose additional tax on our service and solution for example change in law and regulation to limit using off shore resource in connection with our work or to penalize company that use off shore resource which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdiction could adversely affect our result of operation such change may result in contract being terminated or work being transferred on shore resulting in greater cost to in addition these change could have negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government client our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability we are subject to and may become party to variety of litigation or other claim and suit that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employee client alliance partner subcontractor supplier competitor shareholder government agency or others through private action class action whistleblower claim administrative proceeding regulatory action or other litigation regardless of the merit of the claim the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant and such matter can be time consuming and divert management attention and resource the result of litigation and other legal proceeding are inherently uncertain and adverse judgment or settlement in some or all of these legal dispute may result in materially adverse monetary damage fine penalty or injunctive relief against any claim or litigation even if fully indemnified or insured could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligation contribute to internal control or other deficiency of client or otherwise breach obligation to third party including client alliance partner employee and former employee and other party with whom we conduct business or if our subcontractor breach or dispute the term of our agreement with them and impede our ability to meet our obligation to our client for example by taking over the operation of certain portion of our client business including function and system that are critical to the core business of our client we may be exposed to additional and evolving operational regulatory reputational or other risk specific to these area including risk related to data security failure of client system based on our service or solution could also subject to claim for significant damage that could materially adversely affect our result of operation we may enter into agreement with non standard term because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guideline in addition the contracting practice of competitor along with the demand of increasingly sophisticated client may cause contract term and condition that are unfavorable to to become new standard in the industry we may find committed to providing service or solution that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause financial loss if we can not or do not meet our contractual obligation and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the term of our agreement liability limitation are not enforced or third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent from relying upon those contractual protection we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our result of operation could be materially adversely affected in addition we expand our service and solution into new area we may be exposed to additional and evolving risk specific to these new area while we maintain insurance for certain potential liability such insurance doe not cover all type and amount of potential liability and is subject to various exclusion well cap on amount recoverable even if we believe of contentsa claim is covered by insurance insurer may dispute our entitlement to recovery for variety of potential reason which may affect the timing and if they prevail the amount of our recovery our work with government client expose to additional risk inherent in the government contracting environment our client include national provincial state and local governmental entity our government work carry various risk inherent in the government contracting process these risk include but are not limited to the following government entity particularly in the united state often reserve the right to audit our contract cost and conduct inquiry and investigation of our business practice and compliance with government contract requirement government agency including the defense contract audit agency routinely audit our contract cost including allocated indirect cost for compliance with the cost accounting standard and the federal acquisition regulation these agency also conduct review and investigation and make inquiry regarding our accounting information technology and other system in connection with our performance and business practice with respect to our government contract negative finding from existing and future audit investigation or inquiry or failure to comply with applicable it security requirement could affect our future sale and profitability by preventing by operation of law or in practice from receiving new government contract for some period of time in addition if the government concludes that certain cost are not reimbursable have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimate of our work then we will not be allowed to bill for such cost may have to refund money that ha already been paid to or could be required to retroactively and prospectively adjust previously agreed to billing or pricing rate for our work negative finding from existing and future audit of our business system including our accounting system may result in the government preventing from billing at least temporarily percentage of our cost result of prior negative finding in connection with audit investigation and inquiry we have from time to time experienced some of the adverse consequence described above and may in the future experience further adverse consequence which could materially adversely affect our future result of operation if government client discovers improper or illegal activity in the course of audit or investigation we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalty including those under the civil false claim act and administrative sanction which may include termination of contract forfeiture of profit suspension of payment fine and suspension or debarment from doing business with other agency of that government the inherent limitation of internal control may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activity government contracting regulation impose strict compliance and disclosure obligation disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of credible evidence of violation of federal criminal law involving fraud conflict of interest bribery or improper gratuity violation of the civil false claim act or receipt of significant overpayment from the government failure to make required disclosure could be basis for suspension and or debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the federal level reported matter also could lead to audit or investigation and other civil criminal or administrative sanction government contract are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risk compared to contract with commercial client for example government contract and the proceeding surrounding them are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity negative publicity including an allegation of improper or illegal activity regardless of it accuracy may adversely affect our reputation term and condition of government contract also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate for example these contract often contain high or unlimited liability for breach and feature le favorable payment term and sometimes require to take on liability for the performance of third party government entity typically fund project through appropriated monies while these project are often planned and executed multi year project government entity usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these project for lack of approved funding and or at their convenience change in government or political development including budget deficit shortfall or uncertainty government spending reduction or other debt constraint could result in our project being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether which also could limit our recovery of incurred cost reimbursable expense and profit on work completed prior to the termination furthermore if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination cost we may not be able to fully recover our investment political and economic factor such pending election the outcome of recent election change in leadership among key executive or legislative decision maker revision to governmental tax or other policy and reduced tax revenue can affect the number and term of new government contract signed or the speed at which new contract are signed decrease future level of spending and authorization for program that of contentswe bid shift spending priority to program in area for which we do not provide service and or lead to change in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rule or law is assessed our ability to work for the government is impacted by the fact that we are an irish company we elected to enter into proxy agreement with the department of defense that enhances the ability of our federal government contracting subsidiary to perform certain work for the government the proxy agreement regulates the management and operation of and limit the control we can exercise over this subsidiary in addition legislative and executive proposal remain under consideration or could be proposed in the future which if enacted could place additional limitation on or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contract in the united state or could include requirement that would otherwise affect our result of operation various federal and state legislative proposal have been introduced and or enacted in recent year that deny government contract to certain company that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the united state while accenture wa not company that reincorporated outside the united state it is possible that these contract ban and other legislative proposal could be applied in way that negatively affect accenture the occurrence or condition described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entity involved but also our business with other entity of the same or other governmental body or with certain commercial client and could have material adverse effect on our business or our result of operation if we are unable to manage the organizational challenge associated with our size we might be unable to achieve our business objective of august we had approximately employee worldwide our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenge it might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standard across large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge it might also become more difficult to maintain our culture effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operation and effectively communicate our core value policy and procedure strategy and goal particularly given our world wide operation the size and scope of our operation increase the possibility that we will have employee who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose to unacceptable business risk despite our effort to train them and maintain internal control to prevent such instance for example employee misconduct could involve the improper use of our client sensitive or confidential information or the failure to comply with legislation or regulation regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information furthermore the inappropriate use of social networking site by our employee could result in breach of confidentiality unauthorized disclosure of non public company information or damage to our reputation if we do not continue to develop and implement the right process and tool to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core value into all of our employee our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objective could be impaired in addition from time to time we have made and may continue to make change to our operating model including how we are organized the need and size of our business change and if we do not successfully implement the change our business and result of operation may be negatively impacted our ability to attract and retain business and employee may depend on our reputation in the marketplace we believe the accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate asset that help distinguish our service and solution from those of competitor and also contribute to our effort to recruit and retain talented employee however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by event such dispute with client cybersecurity breach or service outage internal control deficiency delivery failure compliance violation government investigation or legal proceeding we may also experience reputational damage from employee advocacy group and other stakeholder that disagree with the service and solution that we offer or the client that we serve similarly our reputation could be damaged by action or statement of current or former client director employee competitor vendor alliance partner joint venture partner adversary in legal proceeding legislator or government regulator well member of the investment community or the medium including social medium influencers there is risk that negative or inaccurate information about accenture even if based on rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business damage to our reputation could be difficult expensive and time consuming to repair could make potential or existing client reluctant to select for new engagement resulting in loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention effort damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in materially adversely affecting our share price of contentsif we do not successfully manage and develop our relationship with key alliance partner or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliance in new technology our result of operation could be adversely affected we have alliance with company whose capability complement our own significant portion of our revenue and service and solution are based on technology or software provided by major alliance partner see business alliance the business that we conduct through these alliance could decrease or fail to grow for variety of reason the priority and objective of our alliance partner may differ from ours and our alliance partner are not prohibited from competing with or forming closer or preferred arrangement with our competitor in addition some of our alliance partner are also large client or supplier of technology to the decision we make vi vi an alliance partner may impact our ongoing alliance relationship in addition our alliance partner could experience reduced demand for their technology or software including for example in response to change in technology which could lessen related demand for our service and solution we must anticipate and respond to continuous change in technology and develop alliance relationship with new provider of relevant technology we must secure meaningful alliance with these provider early in their life cycle so that we can develop the right number of certified people with skill in new technology if we are unable to maintain our relationship with current partner and identify new and emerging provider of relevant technology to expand our network of alliance partner we may not be able to differentiate our service or compete effectively in the market if we do not obtain the expected benefit from our alliance relationship for any reason we may be le competitive our ability to offer attractive solution to our client may be negatively affected and our result of operation could be adversely affected we might not be successful at acquiring investing in or integrating business entering into joint venture or divesting business we expect to continue pursuing strategic acquisition investment and joint venture to enhance or add to our skill and capability or offering of service and solution or to enable to expand in certain geographic and other market depending on the opportunity available we may increase the amount of capital invested in such opportunity we may not succeed in completing targeted transaction including result of the market becoming increasingly competitive or achieve desired result of operation furthermore we face risk in successfully integrating any business we might acquire or create through joint venture ongoing business may be disrupted and our management attention may be diverted by acquisition investment transition or integration activity in addition we might need to dedicate additional management and other resource and our organizational structure could make it difficult for to efficiently integrate acquired business into our ongoing operation and assimilate and retain employee of those business into our culture and operation the loss of key executive employee customer supplier vendor and other business partner of business we acquire may adversely impact the value of the asset operation or business furthermore acquisition or joint venture may result in significant cost and expense including those related to retention payment equity compensation severance pay early retirement cost intangible asset amortization and asset impairment charge assumed litigation and other liability and legal accounting and financial advisory fee which could negatively affect our profitability we may have difficulty result of entering into new market where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitor may have stronger market position we might fail to realize the expected benefit or strategic objective of any acquisition investment or joint venture we undertake we might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money we may be adversely impacted by liability that we assume from company we acquire or in which we invest including from that company known and unknown obligation intellectual property or other asset terminated employee current or former client or other third party in addition we may fail to identify or adequately ass the magnitude of certain liability shortcoming or other circumstance prior to acquiring investing in or partnering with company including potential exposure to regulatory sanction or liability resulting from an acquisition target previous activity internal control and security environment if any of these circumstance occurs they could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure unfavorable accounting treatment unexpected increase in tax or other adverse effect on our business in addition we have lesser degree of control over the business operation of the joint venture and business in which we have made minority investment or in which we have acquired le than of the equity this lesser degree of control may expose to additional reputational financial legal compliance or operational risk litigation indemnification claim and other unforeseen claim and liability may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired business for example we may face litigation or other claim result of certain term and condition of the acquisition agreement such earnout payment or closing net asset adjustment alternatively shareholder litigation of contentsmay arise result of proposed acquisition if we are unable to complete the number and kind of investment for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired business into our operation we may not be able to achieve our planned rate of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific market or service we also periodically evaluate and have engaged in the disposition of asset and business divestiture could involve difficulty in the separation of operation service product and personnel the diversion of management attention the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employee after reaching an agreement with buyer for the disposition of business the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of pre closing condition including obtaining necessary regulatory and government approval which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent from completing the transaction divestiture may also involve continued financial involvement in or liability with respect to the divested asset and business such indemnity or other financial obligation in which the performance of the divested asset or business could impact our result of operation any divestiture we undertake could adversely affect our result of operation if we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property right or if our service or solution infringe upon the intellectual property right of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others our business could be adversely affected our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our proprietary methodology process software and other solution existing law of the various country in which we provide service or solution may offer only limited intellectual property protection of our service or solution and the protection in some country may be very limited we rely upon combination of confidentiality policy nondisclosure and other contractual arrangement and patent trade secret copyright and trademark law to protect our intellectual property right these law are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to obtain or maintain intellectual property protection there is uncertainty concerning the scope of patent and other intellectual property protection for software and business method which are field in which we rely on intellectual property law to protect our right even where we obtain intellectual property protection our intellectual property right may not prevent or deter competitor former employee or other third party from reverse engineering our solution or proprietary methodology and process or independently developing service or solution similar to or duplicative of ours further the step we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitor former employee or other third party and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely step to enforce our intellectual property right enforcing our right might also require considerable time money and oversight and we may not be successful in enforcing our right in addition we can not be sure that our service and solution including for example our software solution or the solution of others that we offer to our client do not infringe on the intellectual property right of third party and these third party could claim that we or our client are infringing upon their intellectual property right additionally individual and firm have purchased intellectual property asset in order to assert claim of infringement against technology provider and customer that use such technology these claim could harm our reputation cause to incur substantial cost or prevent from offering some service or solution in the future any related proceeding could require to expend significant resource over an extended period of time in most of our contract we agree to indemnify our client for expense and liability resulting from claimed infringement of the intellectual property right of third party in some instance the amount of these indemnity could be greater than the revenue we receive from the client any claim or litigation in this area could be time consuming and costly damage our reputation and or require to incur additional cost to obtain the right to continue to offer service or solution to our client if we can not secure this right at all or on reasonable term or we are unable to implement in cost effective manner alternative technology our result of operation could be materially adversely affected the risk of infringement claim against may increase we expand our industry software solution and continue to develop and license our software to multiple client any infringement action brought against or our client could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against further we rely on third party software in providing some of our service and solution if we lose our ability to continue using any such software for any reason including because it is found to infringe the right of others we will need to obtain substitute software or seek alternative mean of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such service and solution our inability to replace such software or to replace such software in timely or cost effective manner could materially adversely affect our result of operation of contentsour result of operation and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal control the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal control we are required to provide report from management to our shareholder on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these control internal control over financial reporting ha inherent limitation including human error the possibility that control could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed condition and fraud because of these inherent limitation internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatement or fraud if we can not maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved control that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statement for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation incur incremental compliance cost fail to meet our public reporting requirement on timely basis be unable to properly report on our business and our result of operation or be required to restate our financial statement and our result of operation our share price and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected change to accounting standard or in the estimate and assumption we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statement could adversely affect our financial result our financial statement have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle it is possible that change in accounting standard could have material adverse effect on our result of operation and financial position the application of generally accepted accounting principle requires to make estimate and assumption about certain item and future event that affect our reported financial condition and our accompanying disclosure with respect to among other thing revenue recognition and income tax our most critical accounting estimate are described in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation under critical accounting policy and estimate we base our estimate on historical experience contractual commitment and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance and at the time they are made these estimate and assumption involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty some of which are beyond our control if our estimate or the assumption underlying such estimate are not correct actual result may differ materially from our estimate and we may need to among other thing adjust revenue or accrue additional cost that could adversely affect our result of operation many of our contract include fee subject to the attainment of target or specific service level this could increase the variability of our revenue and impact our margin many of our contract include clause that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreed upon performance standard or milestone if we fail to satisfy these measure it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fee under the contract increase the cost to of meeting performance standard or milestone delay expected payment or subject to potential damage claim under the contract term client also often have the right to terminate contract and pursue damage claim under the contract for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitment we also have number of contract in which portion of our compensation depends on performance measure such cost saving revenue enhancement benefit produced business goal attained and adherence to schedule these goal can be complex and may depend on our client actual level of business activity or may be based on assumption that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate these provision could increase the variability in revenue and margin earned on those contract we might be unable to access additional capital on favorable term or at all if we raise equity capital it may dilute our shareholder ownership interest in we might choose to raise additional fund through public or private debt or equity financing in order to take advantage of opportunity including more rapid expansion acquire other business or asset repurchase share from our shareholder develop new service and solution or respond to competitive pressure any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholder ownership percentage in furthermore any additional financing we need might not be available on term favorable to or at all we are incorporated in ireland and significant portion of our asset is located outside the united state result it might not be possible for shareholder to enforce civil liability provision of the federal or state of contentssecurities law of the united state we may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in ireland we are organized under the law of ireland and significant portion of our asset is located outside the united state shareholder who obtains court judgment based on the civil liability provision of federal or state security law may be unable to enforce the judgment against in ireland or in country other than the united state where we have asset in addition there is some doubt to whether the court of ireland and other country would recognize or enforce judgment of court obtained against or our director or officer based on the civil liability provision of the federal or state security law of the united state or would hear action against or those person based on those law although the united state and ireland do not currently have treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgment in civil and commercial matter the irish court will recognize judgment if the following important requirement are satisfied the originating court is court of competent jurisdiction the judgment is final and conclusive and the judgment wa not obtained by fraud and it recognition is not contrary to irish public policy any judgment obtained in contravention of the rule of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in ireland similarly judgment might not be enforceable in country other than the united state where we have asset some company that conduct substantial business in the united state but which have parent domiciled in certain other jurisdiction have been criticized improperly avoiding tax or creating an unfair competitive advantage over company accenture never conducted business under parent company and pay tax on all of it operation nonetheless we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in ireland irish law differs from the law in effect in the united state and might afford le protection to shareholder our shareholder could have more difficulty protecting their interest than would shareholder of corporation incorporated in jurisdiction of the united state an irish company we are governed by the company act the company act differs in some significant and possibly material respect from law applicable to corporation and shareholder under various state corporation law including the provision relating to interested director merger and acquisition takeover shareholder lawsuit and indemnification of director under irish law the duty of director and officer of company are generally owed to the company only shareholder of irish company do not generally have right to take action against director or officer of the company under irish law and may only do so in limited circumstance director of an irish company must in exercising their power and performing their duty act with due care and skill honestly and in good faith with view to the best interest of the company director have duty not to put themselves in position in which their duty to the company and their personal interest might conflict and also are under duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of it subsidiary if director or officer of an irish company is found to have breached duty to that company could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty under irish law we must have authority from our shareholder to issue any share including share that are part of the company authorized but unissued share capital in addition unless otherwise authorized by it shareholder when an irish company issue share for cash to new shareholder it is required first to offer those share on the same or more favorable term to existing shareholder on pro rata basis if we are unable to obtain these authorization from our shareholder or are otherwise limited by the term of our authorization our ability to issue share under our equity compensation plan

favorable currency translation our revenue revenue growth and result of operation in dollar may be higher if the dollar strengthens against other currency resulting in unfavorable currency translation our revenue revenue growth and result of operation in dollar may be lower the dollar strengthened against various currency during fiscal resulting in unfavorable currency translation and dollar revenue growth that wa approximately lower than our revenue growth in local currency for the year assuming that exchange rate stay within recent range we estimate that our full fiscal revenue growth

primarily by compensation cost for business development activity marketing and advertising related activity and certain acquisition related cost general and administrative cost primarily include cost for non client facing personnel information system office space and certain acquisition related cost utilization for fiscal wa consistent with fiscal we continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand we proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take action needed to address change in the anticipated demand for our service and solution given that compensation cost are the most significant portion of our operating expense based on current and projected future demand we have increased our headcount the majority of which serve our client to approximately of august compared to approximately of august the year over year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our service and solution well headcount added in connection with acquisition attrition excluding involuntary termination for fiscal wa up from in fiscal we evaluate voluntary attrition adjust level of new hiring and use involuntary termination mean to keep our supply of skill and resource in balance with change in client demand in addition we adjust compensation in certain skill set and geography in order to attract and retain appropriate number of qualified employee for the majority of our personnel compensation increase become effective december of each fiscal year we strive to adjust pricing and or the mix of resource to reduce the impact of compensation increase on our margin our ability to grow our revenue and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to keep our supply of skill and resource in balance with change in the type or amount of service and solution client are demanding recover increase in compensation deploy our employee globally on timely basis manage attrition and or effectively

tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of the tax law change in fiscal we believe doing so facilitates understanding to both the impact of these change and our financial performance when comparing these period our operating income and diluted earnings per share are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuation on revenue and cost most of our cost are incurred in the same currency the related revenue where practical we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for cost not incurred in the same currency the related revenue such the cost associated with our global delivery model by using currency protection provision in our customer contract and through our hedging program for more information on our hedging program see note financial instrument to our consolidated financial statement under item financial statement and supplementary data bookingsnew booking for fiscal were billion with consulting booking of billion and outsourcing booking of billion we provide information regarding our new booking which include new contract including those acquired through acquisition well renewal extension and change to existing contract because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding change in the volume of our new business over time new booking can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of small number of large outsourcing contract the type of service and solution client are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new booking to revenue for example outsourcing booking which are typically for multi year contract generally convert to revenue over longer period of time compared to consulting booking information regarding our new booking is not comparable to should it be substituted for an analysis of our revenue over time new booking involve estimate and judgment there are no third party standard or requirement governing the calculation of booking we do not update our new booking for material subsequent termination or reduction related to booking originally recorded in prior fiscal year new booking are recorded using then existing foreign currency exchange rate and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation the majority of our contract are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalty and some without notice under topic only the non cancelable portion of these contract is included in our performance obligation accordingly significant portion of what we consider contract booking is not included in our remaining performance obligation of contentscritical accounting policy and estimate the preparation of our consolidated financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle requires to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability and disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the consolidated financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense we continually evaluate our estimate judgment and assumption based on available information and experience because the use of estimate is inherent in the financial reporting process actual result could differ from those estimate certain of our accounting policy require higher degree of judgment than others in their application these include certain aspect of accounting for revenue recognition and income tax revenue recognition determining the method and amount of revenue to recognize requires to make judgment and estimate specifically complex arrangement with nonstandard term and condition may require contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting including whether promised good and service specified in an arrangement are distinct performance obligation and should be accounted for separately other judgment include determining whether performance obligation are satisfied over time or at point in time and the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion we measure progress towards completion for technology integration consulting service using cost incurred to date relative to total estimated cost at completion revenue including estimated fee are recorded proportionally cost are incurred the amount of revenue recognized for these contract in period is dependent on our ability to estimate total contract cost we continually evaluate our estimate of total contract cost based on available information and experience additionally the nature of our contract give rise to several type of variable consideration including incentive fee many contract include incentive or penalty related to cost incurred benefit produced or adherence to schedule that may increase the variability in revenue and margin earned on such contract we conduct review prior to signing such contract to evaluate whether these incentive are reasonably achievable our estimate are monitored over the life of our contract and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance historical experience and other information available at the time for additional information see note revenue to our consolidated financial statement under item financial statement and supplementary data income tax on december the enacted the tax cut and job act the tax act which significantly changed tax law the tax act lowered the statutory federal income tax rate from to effective january resulting in blended statutory federal income tax rate of for our fiscal year ended august and statutory federal income tax rate of for our fiscal year ended august the tax act base erosion and anti abuse tax provision and regulation issued thereunder adversely impact our effective tax rate by limiting our ability to deduct certain expense determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense income tax liability and deferred tax asset and liability involves judgment deferred tax asset and liability measured using enacted tax rate are recognized for the future tax consequence of temporary difference between the tax and financial statement base of asset and liability global company we calculate and provide for income tax in each of the tax jurisdiction in which we operate this involves estimating current tax exposure in each jurisdiction well making judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred tax asset tax exposure can involve complex issue and may require an extended period to resolve in assessing the realizability of deferred tax asset we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly factor considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset tax planning strategy and historical and projected taxable income well tax liability for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located valuation allowance will be subject to change in each future reporting period result of change in one or more of these factor change in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before tax can affect the overall effective tax rate we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating result to determine the interim provision for income tax expense change in judgment that impact the measurement of tax position taken in prior year is recognized discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs in the event there is significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating result the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs of contentsno tax have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested if future event including material change in estimate of cash working capital and long term investment requirement necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for tax may apply which could materially affect our future effective tax rate we currently do not foresee any event that would require to distribute these indefinitely reinvested earnings for additional information see note income tax to our consolidated financial statement under item financial statement and supplementary data matter of course we are regularly audited by various taxing authority and sometimes these audit result in proposed assessment where the ultimate resolution may result in owing additional tax we establish tax liability or reduce tax asset when despite our belief that our tax return position are appropriate and supportable under local tax law we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain position if challenged in evaluating tax position we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeal or litigation process based on the technical merit of the position our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumption based on past experience judgment about potential action by taxing jurisdiction well judgment about the likely outcome of issue that have been raised by taxing jurisdiction the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon settlement we evaluate tax position each quarter and adjust the related tax liability or asset in light of changing fact and circumstance such the progress of tax audit or the expiration of statute of limitation we believe the estimate and assumption used to support our evaluation of tax position are reasonable however final determination of prior year tax liability either by settlement with tax authority or expiration of statute of limitation could be materially different from estimate reflected in asset and liability and historical income tax provision the outcome of these final determination could have material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flow in the period in which that determination is made we believe our tax position comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for these position revenue by segment operating group

similar characteristic and are subject to the same factor pressure and challenge however the economic environment and it effect on the industry served by our operating group affect revenue and operating expense within our operating group to differing degree the mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating group local currency fluctuation also tend to affect our operating group differently depending on the geographic concentration and location of their business while we provide discussion about our result of operation below we can not measure how much of our revenue growth in particular period is attributable to change in price or volume management doe not track standard measure of unit or rate volume instead our measure of volume and price are extremely

financial statement and accompanying disclosure although these estimate are based on management best knowledge of current event and action that we may undertake in the future actual result may be different from those estimate revenue recognition we account for revenue in accordance with fasb asu no revenue from contract with customer topic which we adopted on september using the modified retrospective method performance obligation performance obligation is promise in contract to transfer distinct good or service to the client and is the unit of accounting in topic contract transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized revenue when or the performance obligation is satisfied for contract with multiple performance obligation we allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus margin approach under which we forecast our expected cost of satisfying performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service based on margin for similar service sold on standalone basis while determining relative standalone selling price and identifying separate performance obligation require judgment generally relative standalone selling price and the separate performance obligation are readily identifiable we sell those performance obligation unaccompanied by other performance obligation contract modification are routine in the performance of contentsaccenture plcnotes to consolidated financial statement continued in thousand of dollar except share and per share amount or otherwise disclosed of our contract contract are often modified to account for change in the contract specification requirement or duration if contract modification result in the addition of performance obligation priced at standalone selling price or if the post modification service are distinct from the service provided prior to the modification the modification is accounted for separately if the modified service are not distinct they are accounted for part of the existing contract our revenue are derived from contract for outsourcing service technology integration consulting service and non technology consulting service these contract have different term based on the scope performance obligation and complexity of the engagement which frequently require to make judgment and estimate in recognizing revenue we have many type of contract including time and material contract fixed price contract fee per transaction contract and contract with multiple fee type the nature of our contract give rise to several type of variable consideration including incentive fee many contract include incentive or penalty related to cost incurred benefit produced or adherence to schedule that may increase the variability in revenue and margin earned on such contract these variable amount generally are awarded or refunded upon achievement of or failure to achieve certain performance metric milestone or cost target and can be based upon client discretion we include these variable fee in the estimated transaction price when there is basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee and it is not probable significant reversal of revenue will occur these estimate reflect the expected value of the variable fee and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance historical experience and other information available at the time our performance obligation are satisfied over time work progress or at point in time the majority of our revenue are recognized over time based on the extent of progress towards satisfying our performance obligation the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the contract and the nature of the service to be provided outsourcing contract our outsourcing contract typically span several year revenue are generally recognized on outsourcing contract over time because our client benefit from the service they are performed outsourcing contract require to provide series of distinct service each period over the contract term revenue from unit priced contract are recognized transaction are processed when contractual billing represent an amount

when we satisfy our performance obligation and the client obtains control of the promised good or service contract estimate estimate of total contract revenue and cost are continuously monitored over the life of our contract and recorded revenue and cost estimate are subject to revision the contract progress if at any time the estimate of contentsaccenture plcnotes to consolidated financial

asset and deferred revenue contract liability on our consolidated balance sheet amount are billed work progress in accordance with agreed upon contractual term either at periodic interval monthly or quarterly or upon achievement of contractual milestone our receivables are right to consideration that are conditional only upon the passage of time compared to our contract asset which are right to consideration conditional upon additional factor when we bill or receive payment from our client before revenue is recognized we record contract liability contract asset and liability are reported on our consolidated balance sheet on contract by contract basis at the end of each reporting period for some outsourcing contract we receive payment for transition or set up activity which are deferred and recognized revenue the service are provided these advance payment are typically not significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demand in the early stage of

deferred tax asset and liability measured using enacted tax rate are recognized for the future tax consequence of temporary difference between the tax and financial statement base of asset and
