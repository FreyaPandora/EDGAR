and construction contract critical accounting policy and estimatesthe preparation of the consolidated financial statement and note to consolidated financial statement presented in this form requires to make estimate that affect the reported amount of asset liability sale and expense and related disclosure of contingent asset and liability we base these estimate on historical result and various other assumption believed to be reasonable all of which form the basis for making estimate concerning the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily available from other source actual result may differ from these estimate our significant accounting policy are described in note to the consolidated financial statement we believe that the following accounting policy affect the most significant estimate and management judgment used in preparing the consolidated financial statement merchandise inventorydescriptionwe record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventory below cost this reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory level sale trend and historical experience during our reserve decreased approximately million to million of january we also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventory this reserve is based primarily on actual shrinkage result from previous physical inventory during the inventory shrinkage reserve increased approximately million to million of january in addition we receive fund from vendor in the normal course of business principally result of purchase volume sale early payment or promotion of vendor product generally these vendor fund do not represent the reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable cost that we incurred to sell the vendor product therefore we treat these fund reduction in the cost of inventory the amount are accrued and recognize these fund reduction of cost of sale when the of contentsinventory is sold fund that are determined to be reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable cost incurred to sell vendor product are recorded an offset to the related expense judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimatewe do not believe that our merchandise inventory are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practice based on anticipated sale trend and general economic condition however change in consumer purchasing pattern or deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserve likewise change in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary based on the timing and result of physical inventory we also apply judgment in the determination of level of obsolete inventory and assumption about net realizable value for vendor fund we develop accrual rate based on the provision of the agreement in place due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreement we perform analysis and review historical purchase trend and volume throughout the year adjust accrual rate appropriate and confirm actual amount with select vendor to ensure the amount earned are appropriately recorded amount accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volume differ from projected purchase volume especially in the case of program that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volume are met effect if actual result differ from assumptionswe have not made any material change in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserve for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal year we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimate for both of these inventory reserve however it is possible that actual result could differ from recorded reserve change in either the amount of product considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately million for change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrinkage reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately million for we have not made any material change in the methodology used to recognize vendor fund during the past three fiscal year if actual result are not consistent with the assumption and estimate used we could be exposed to additional adjustment that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory however substantially all receivables associated with these activity do not require subjective long term estimate because they are collected within the following fiscal year adjustment to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material equity method investmentsdescriptionwe use the equity method to account for investment in company if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over operating and financial policy of the investee our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these company is included in consolidated net earnings each of the company equity method investment is subject to review for impairment if and when circumstance indicate that the fair value of our investment could be le than the carrying value if the result of our review indicate an other than temporary decline in the carrying value of our investment the company would write the investment to it estimated fair value judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimateour impairment evaluation for equity method investment require to apply judgment in determining whether decrease in value that is other than temporary ha occurred if we need to ass the recoverability of our equity method investment we will make assumption regarding estimated future cash flow of those investment these calculation require to apply judgment including assumption of future performance based on business plan and forecast recent economic and business trend and competitive condition effect if actual result differ from assumptionsin the fourth quarter of fiscal year we made the decision to exit our australian joint venture investment with woolworth limited woolworth and recorded million impairment of our investment due to determination that there wa decrease in value that wa other than temporary we own one third share in the joint venture hydrox holding pty ltd which operates master home improvement store and home timber and hardware group retail store and wholesale distribution in australia result of our decision to exit woolworth will be required to purchase lowe one third share in the joint venture at an agreed upon fair value of january the date of our notification of our intention to exit the process for the two party agreeing on fair value is prescribed in the joint venture agreement finalization of the purchase price for lowe interest in the joint venture and completion of the sale is expected to occur in the million non cash impairment charge which includes the cumulative impact of the strengthening dollar over the life of the investment of contentswas based on the company estimate of the value of it portion of the overall joint venture fair value this value wa determined using an income approach based on expected discounted cash flow and wa validated for reasonableness by comparison to similar transaction multiple the assumption that most significantly affect the fair value determination include the continuation going concern projected revenue projected margin rate and the discount rate further change in this estimate are possible the party proceed through the final stage of the valuation process defined in the joint venture agreement change in our current estimate of fair value of the joint venture would have affected net earnings by approximately million for long lived asset impairmentdescriptionwe review the carrying amount of location whenever certain event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable when evaluating location for impairment our asset group is at an individual location level that is the lowest level for which cash flow are identifiable cash flow for individual location do not include an allocation of corporate overhead we evaluate location for triggering event relating to long lived asset impairment on quarterly basis to determine when location asset carrying value may not be recoverable for operating location our primary indicator that asset carrying value may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for month period for those location that have been open in the same location for sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating result management also monitor other factor when evaluating operating location for impairment including individual location execution of their operating plan and local market condition including incursion which is the opening of either other lowe location or those of direct competitor within the same market we also consider there to be triggering event when there is current expectation that it is more likely than not that given location will be closed significantly before the end of it previously estimated useful life potential impairment ha occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location asset are le than the carrying amount of the asset when determining the stream of projected future cash flow associated with an individual operating location management make assumption incorporating local market condition about key store variable including sale growth rate gross margin and controllable expense such store payroll and occupancy expense well asset residual value or lease rate an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds it fair value we use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating location which requires discounting projected future cash flow this involves making assumption regarding both location future cash flow described above and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flow we discount our cash flow estimate at rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participant would assign to the cash flow the selected market participant represent group of other retailer with market footprint similar in size to ours judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimateour impairment evaluation for long lived asset require to apply judgment in determining whether triggering event ha occurred including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that location will be closed significantly before the end of it previously estimated useful life our impairment loss calculation require to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flow including estimated sale margin and controllable expense assumption about market performance for operating location and estimated selling price or lease rate for location identified for closure we also apply judgment in estimating asset fair value including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair value determined using an income approach effect if actual result differ from assumptionsduring two operating location experienced triggering event and both location were determined to be impaired we recorded impairment loss related to these two operating location of million during compared to impairment loss of million related to three operating location impaired during we have not made any material change in the methodology used to estimate the future cash flow of operating location or location identified for closure during the past three fiscal year if the actual result are not consistent with the assumption and judgment we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that location will be closed significantly before the end of it useful life or in estimating future cash flow and determining asset fair value our actual impairment loss could vary positively or negatively from our estimated impairment loss of contentsself insurancedescriptionwe are self insured for certain loss relating to worker compensation automobile general and product liability extended protection plan and certain medical and dental claim our self insured retention or deductible applicable is limited to million per occurrence involving worker compensation million per occurrence involving general or product liability and million per occurrence involving automobile we do not have any insurance coverage for self insured extended protection plan or medical and dental claim self insurance claim filed and claim incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimate of the discounted ultimate cost for self insured claim incurred using actuarial assumption followed in the insurance industry and historical experience during our self insurance liability decreased approximately million to million of january judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimatethese estimate are subject to change in the regulatory environment utilized discount rate projected exposure including payroll sale and vehicle unit well the frequency lag and severity of claim effect if actual result differ from assumptionswe have not made any material change in the methodology used to establish our self insurance liability during the past three fiscal year although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate loss related to claim it is possible that actual result could differ from recorded self insurance liability change in our self insurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately million for basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately million for revenue recognitiondescriptionsee note to the consolidated financial statement for discussion of our revenue recognition policy the following accounting estimate relating to revenue recognition require management to make assumption and apply judgment regarding the effect of future event that can not be determined with certainty we sell separately priced extended protection plan contract under lowe branded program for which the company is ultimately self insured the company recognizes revenue from extended protection plan sale on straight line basis over the respective contract term extended protection plan contract term primarily range from one to four year from the date of purchase or the end of the manufacturer warranty applicable the company consistently group and evaluates extended protection plan contract based on the characteristic of the underlying product and the coverage provided in order to monitor for expected loss loss on the overall contract would be recognized if the expected cost of performing service under the contract exceeded the amount of unamortized acquisition cost and related deferred revenue associated with the contract deferred revenue associated with the extended protection plan contract decreased million to million of january we defer revenue and cost of sale associated with settled transaction for which customer have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation ha not yet been completed revenue is deferred based on the actual amount received we use historical gross margin rate to estimate the adjustment to cost of sale for these transaction during deferred revenue associated with these transaction increased million to million of january judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimatefor extended protection plan there is judgment inherent in our evaluation of expected loss result of our methodology for grouping and evaluating extended protection plan contract and from the actuarial determination of the estimated cost of the contract there is also judgment inherent in our determination of the recognition pattern of cost of performing service under these contract for the deferral of revenue and cost of sale associated with transaction for which customer have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation ha not yet been completed there is judgment inherent in our estimate of gross margin rate effect if actual result differ from assumptionswe have not made any material change in the methodology used to recognize revenue on our extended protection plan contract during the past three fiscal year we currently do not anticipate incurring any overall contract loss on our extended protection plan contract although we believe that we have the ability to adequately monitor and estimate expected loss of contentsunder the extended protection plan contract it is possible that actual result could differ from our estimate in addition if future evidence indicates that the cost of performing service under these contract are incurred on other than straight line basis the timing of revenue recognition under these contract could change change in the amount of revenue recognized in under these contract would have affected net earnings by approximately million we have not made any material change in the methodology used to reverse net sale and cost of sale related to amount received for which customer have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation ha not yet been completed we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimate related to the impact to cost of sale for these transaction however if actual result are not consistent with our estimate or assumption we may incur additional income or expense change in the estimate of the gross margin rate applied to these transaction would have affected net earnings by approximately million in disclosure regarding forward looking statementswe speak throughout this annual report on form in
