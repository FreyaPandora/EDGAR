in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation included in our annual report in item cautionary note concerning factor that may affect future result and in item risk factor in this form each business unit is subject to significant competition from large number of company in the and other country and each competes on the basis of price delivery schedule product performance and service our aerospace business are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturer foreign manufacturer whose government sometimes provide research and development assistance marketing subsidy and other assistance for certain of their commercial product beyond the assistance that may be available in the and company that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare part in particular pratt whitney experience intense competition for new commercial airframe engine combination engine supplier may offer substantial discount and other

regarding customer financing commitment participation in guarantee of customer financing arrangement and performance and operating cost guarantee primarily related to pratt whitney see note and to the consolidated financial statement in our annual report customer selection of engine and component can also have significant impact on later sale of part and service in addition the government and other government policy of purchasing part from supplier other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare part sale significant element of our aerospace business such spare part sale for

factor and item legal proceeding in this form and note to the consolidated financial statement in our annual report compliance with environmental and other government regulationsour operation are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal state and local authority in the and regulatory authority with jurisdiction our foreign operation we have incurred and will likely continue to incur liability under various government statute for the cleanup of pollutant previously released into the environment we do not anticipate that compliance with current provision relating

giving rise to the violation been corrected in addition we could be affected by future law or regulation imposed in response to concern over climate change change in climate change concern or in the regulation of such concern including greenhouse gas emission could subject to additional cost and restriction including compliance cost and increased energy and raw material cost we conduct our business through subsidiary and affiliate worldwide change in legislation or government policy can affect our worldwide operation for example governmental regulation of refrigerant and energy efficiency standard and fire safety regulation are important to our utc climate control security business and elevator safety code are important to the business of otis while government safety and performance regulation restriction on aircraft engine noise and emission and government procurement practice can impact our aerospace business law regulation order and other measure concerning the

source for our purchase of material component service and supply used in our manufacturing we work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce cost we pursue cost reduction through number of mechanism including consolidating our purchase reducing the number of supplier strategic global sourcing and using bidding competition among potential supplier in some instance we depend upon single source of supply or participate in commodity market that may be subject to allocation of limited supply by supplier like other user in the we are largely dependent upon foreign source for certain raw material requirement such cobalt tantalum chromium rhenium and nickel we have number of ongoing program to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk including long term agreement and the conservation of material through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing process we believe that our supply management practice are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risk and the cost of alternative practice although at time high price for some raw material important to our business for example steel copper aluminum titanium and nickel have caused margin and cost pressure we do not foresee near term unavailability of material component or supply that would have material adverse effect on our competitive position result of operation cash flow or

could affect the global economy these economic condition affect business such in number of way tightening of credit in financial market could adversely affect the ability of our customer and supplier to obtain financing for significant purchase and operation and could result in decrease in or cancellation of order for our product and service well impact the ability of our customer to make payment similarly such tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or of our supplier to experience financial distress or bankruptcy our global business is also adversely affected by decrease in the general level of economic activity such decrease in business and consumer spending air travel construction activity the financial strength of airline and business jet operator and government procurement our financial performance is dependent on the condition of the construction and aerospace industry the result of our commercial and industrial business which generated approximately percent of our consolidated sale in are influenced by number of external factor including fluctuation in residential and commercial construction activity regulatory change interest rate labor cost foreign currency exchange rate customer attrition raw material and energy cost global credit market condition and other global and political factor for example slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect the financial performance of otis and utc climate control security in addition the financial performance of utc climate control security can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and particularly in it residential business weather condition the result of our commercial and military aerospace business which generated approximately percent of our consolidated sale in are directly tied to the economic condition in the commercial aviation and defense industry which are cyclical in nature capital spending and demand for aircraft engine aerospace product and component aftermarket part and service by commercial airline aircraft operator and aircraft manufacturer are influenced by wide variety of factor including current and predicted traffic level load factor aircraft fuel pricing labor issue worldwide airline profit airline consolidation bankruptcy competition the retirement of older aircraft regulatory change terrorism and related safety concern general economic condition corporate profitability cost reduction effort and backlog level any of these condition could reduce the sale and margin of our aerospace business other factor including future terrorist action pandemic health issue or major natural disaster could also dramatically reduce the demand for air travel which could negatively impact the sale and margin of our aerospace business additionally substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customer is scheduled for delivery beyond change in economic condition may cause customer to request that firm order be rescheduled or canceled at time our aerospace business also enter into firm fixed price development contract which may require to bear cost overrun related to unforeseen technical and design challenge that arise during the development and early production stage of the program in addition our aerospace business face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturer of new equipment and spare part spare part sale and aftermarket of contentsservice trend are affected by similar factor including usage pricing technological improvement regulatory change and the retirement of older aircraft furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing product in these business segment to market we can not predict the economic condition that will exist any new product is complete reduction in capital spending in the commercial aviation or defense industry could have significant effect on the demand for our product which could have material adverse effect on our competitive position result of operation cash flow or financial condition the defense industry is also affected by changing and global political environment continued pressure on and global defense spending and foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operation government deficit reduction measure congressional and executive branch dispute over budget and debt ceiling and the impact of sequestration have increased market uncertainty and adversely affected our military business should these factor continue and overall government defense spending decline it could result in significant reduction to revenue cash flow profit and backlog for our military business one or more of the program that we currently support or are currently pursuing could be phased limited or terminated reduction in these existing program unless offset by other program and opportunity could have material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flow result of operation or financial condition our international operation subject to economic risk our result of operation may be adversely affected by change in foreign currency fluctuation economic condition and change in local government regulation we conduct our business on global basis with approximately percent of our total segment sale derived from international operation including export sale change in local and regional economic condition including fluctuation in exchange rate may affect product demand and reported profit in our non operation especially the commercial business and canada transaction are generally denominated in local currency in addition currency fluctuation may affect the price we pay supplier for material used in our product result our operating margin also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuation that result in higher cost for certain cross border transaction our financial statement are denominated in dollar accordingly fluctuation in exchange rate may also give rise to translation gain or loss when financial statement of non operating unit are translated into dollar given that the majority of our sale are non based strengthening of the dollar other major foreign currency could adversely affect our result of operation the majority of sale in the aerospace business are transacted in dollar consistent with established industry practice while the majority of cost at location outside the are incurred in the applicable local currency principally the euro the canadian dollar and the polish zloty for operating unit with dollar sale and local currency cost there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our result of operation depending on market change in the exchange rate of the dollar against the applicable foreign currency to manage certain exposure we employ long term hedging strategy associated with dollar sale see note and to the consolidated financial statement in our annual report for further discussion of our hedging strategy our international sale and operation are subject to risk associated with change in local government law regulation and policy including those related to tariff and trade barrier investment taxation exchange control capital control employment regulation and repatriation of earnings government policy on international trade and investment such import quota capital control punitive tax or tariff whether adopted by individual government or addressed by regional trade bloc can affect demand for our product and service impact the competitive position of our product or prevent from being able to manufacture or sell product in certain country the implementation of more restrictive trade policy or the renegotiation of existing trade agreement in the or country where we sell large quantity of product and service or procure supply and other material incorporated into our product could negatively impact our business result of operation and financial condition for example government adoption of buy national policy or retaliation by another government against such policy could have negative impact on our result of operation our international sale and operation are also sensitive to change in foreign national priority including government budget well to political and economic instability international transaction may involve increased financial and legal risk due to differing legal system and custom in foreign country for example condition of sale or award of contract some international customer require to agree to offset arrangement which may include in country purchase manufacturing and financial support arrangement the contract may provide for penalty in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirement in addition part of our globalization strategy we have invested in certain country including argentina brazil china india indonesia mexico poland russia south africa and country in the middle east that carry high level of currency political compliance and economic risk we expect that sale to emerging market will continue to account for significant portion of our sale our business evolve and these and other developing nation and region around the world increase their demand for our product emerging market operation can present many risk including cultural difference such employment and business practice volatility in gross domestic product economic and government instability and the imposition of exchange control and capital control while these factor and their impact are difficult to predict any one or of contentsmore of could have material adverse effect on our competitive position result of operation cash flow or financial condition we use variety of raw material supplier provided part component sub system and contract manufacturing service in our business and significant shortage supplier capacity constraint supplier production disruption or price increase could increase our operating cost and adversely impact the competitive position of our product our reliance on supplier including third party contract manufacturing and logistics and commodity market to secure raw material part component and sub system used in our product expose to volatility in the price and availability of these material in many instance we depend

seek to grow through strategic acquisition in addition to internal growth in the past several year we have made various acquisition and have entered into joint venture arrangement intended to complement and expand our business and expect to continue to do in the future our due diligence review may not identify all of the material issue necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingency of particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanction resulting from an acquisition target previous activity for example we may incur unanticipated cost expense or other liability result of an acquisition target violation of applicable law such the foreign corrupt practice act fcpa or other anti bribery and corruption law in non jurisdiction we may incur unanticipated cost or expense including post closing asset impairment charge expense associated with eliminating duplicate facility litigation and other liability we also may encounter difficulty in integrating acquisition with our operation applying our internal control process to these acquisition or in managing strategic investment additionally we may not realize the degree or timing of benefit we anticipate when we first enter into transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and result of operation in addition accounting requirement relating to business combination including the requirement to expense certain acquisition cost incurred may cause to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during period in which we acquire new business furthermore we make strategic divestiture from time to time our divestiture may result in continued financial exposure to the divested business such through guarantee or other financial arrangement or continued supply and service arrangement following the transaction under these arrangement nonperformance by those divested business could result in obligation being imposed on that could have material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flow result of operation or financial condition the success of future acquisition and divestiture will depend on the

financing at attractive rate the impact on our credit rating and the availability of domestic cash the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock additionally repurchase of our share will reduce the number of outstanding share of our common stock there can be no assurance that any share repurchase will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the level at which we repurchased share of common stock although our share repurchase program is intended to

whitney is currently producing the purepower geared turbofan engine to power various aircraft including the family of aircraft which entered into service in january the level of order received for the purepower family of engine coupled with requirement to achieve mature production level in short timeframe are necessitating significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity if our production ramp up effort are delayed or if supplier can not timely deliver or perform to our standard we may not meet customer production schedule which could result in material additional cost including penalty that could be assessed under existing contractual provision our ability to realize the anticipated benefit of our technological advancement depends on variety of factor including meeting development production certification and regulatory approval schedule execution of internal and external performance plan availability of supplier and internally produced part and material performance of supplier and subcontractor hiring and training of qualified personnel achieving cost and production efficiency identification of emerging technological trend in our target end market validation of innovative technology the level of customer interest in new technology and product and customer acceptance of our product and product that incorporate technology we develop for example certain of our aerospace product are incorporated into larger system and end product manufactured by our customer these system and end product may incorporate additional technology manufactured by third party and involve additional risk and uncertainty result the performance and market acceptance of these larger system and end product could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our own product in the marketplace any development effort divert resource from other potential investment in our business and these effort may not lead to the development of new technology or product on timely basis or meet the need of our customer fully competitive offering in addition the market for our product or product that incorporate our technology may not develop or grow we anticipate we or our customer supplier or subcontractor may encounter difficulty in developing and producing new product and service and may not realize the degree or timing of benefit initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequence due to the design complexity of our product we may in the future experience delay in completing the development and introduction of new product any delay could result in increased development cost or deflect resource from other project in particular we can not predict with certainty whether when and in of
