our network may decrease the number of transaction we process materially and adversely affecting our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business we have agreement with some issuer under which they agree to issue certain payment card that use only the visa network or receive incentive if they do so in addition certain issuer of some debit product choose to include only the visa network we refer to these various practice network exclusivity in addition certain network or issuer rule or practice may be interpreted limiting the routing option of merchant multiple debit network co reside on visa debit card increased regulatory scrutiny in the united state ha already resulted in law that will limit our and issuer ability to impose rule for or choose various form of network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area see the wall street reform and consumer protection act may have material adverse impact on our revenue our prospect for future growth and our overall business these restriction and future regulation like them in the united state and elsewhere have the potential to cause material decrease in the number of transaction we process in order to retain that transaction volume we might have to reduce the fee we charge to issuer or acquirer or we might have to increase the payment and other incentive we provide to issuer or acquirer or directly to merchant any of these eventuality could have material adverse affect on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business interchange reimbursement fee and related practice have been receiving significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide and the resulting regulation may have material adverse impact on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business interchange represents transfer of value between the financial institution participating in payment network such ours in connection with transaction initiated with card in our payment system interchange reimbursement fee are typically paid to issuer the financial institution that issue visa card to cardholder they are typically paid by acquirer the financial institution that offer visa network connectivity and payment acceptance service to merchant we refer to system like ours in which payment network intermediate between the issuer and the acquirer an open loop system table of content we generally do not receive any portion of interchange reimbursement fee they are however factor on which we compete with other payment provider and therefore an important determinant of the volume of transaction we process over our network consequently change to these fee can have substantial impact on our revenue we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fee in the united state and other country however in certain jurisdiction interchange rate and related practice are subject to increased government regulation increased regulatory scrutiny in the united state ha already resulted in limitation on our ability to establish default interchange rate in the debit area see the wall street reform and consumer protection act may have material adverse impact on our revenue our prospect for future growth and our overall business in addition interchange rate have become subject to increased scrutiny elsewhere and regulatory authority and central bank in number of jurisdiction have reviewed or are reviewing them these include australia canada brazil and south africa if we can not set default interchange rate at optimal level issuer and acquirer may find our payment system unattractive this could materially lower overall transaction volume it could also materially increase the attraction of closed loop payment system those with direct connection to both merchant and consumer and other form of payment in addition issuer could begin to charge higher fee to consumer this would make our card program le desirable and reduce our transaction volume and profitability acquirer could elect to charge higher discount rate to merchant regardless of the level of visa interchange leading merchant not to accept card for payment or to steer visa cardholder to alternate payment system in addition issuer and acquirer could attempt to decrease the expense of their card program by seeking incentive from or reduction in the fee that we charge any of the foregoing could have substantial adverse impact on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business the wall street reform and consumer protection act may have material adverse effect on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business the wall street reform and consumer protection act recently enacted in the united state includes provision that will regulate the selection of payment network by issuer and the routing of debit transaction by retailer this may result in the routing of debit transaction onto competing network potentially reducing the processing fee we earn on debit transaction the legislation also establishes regulation and oversight by the federal reserve board of debit interchange rate and certain other network industry practice in addition the federal reserve now ha the power to regulate network fee to the extent necessary to prevent evasion of the new rule on interchange rate the act also created new independent consumer financial protection bureau within the federal reserve system the bureau will assume responsibility for most federal consumer protection law in the area of financial service and will have new authority with respect to consumer issue the bureau action may make payment card transaction le attractive to card issuer this could result in reduction in our payment volume and revenue the new legislation may have material adverse impact on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business failure by our client or by successfully to adjust our strategy to compete in the new environment would increase this impact table of content new regulation in one jurisdiction or of one product segment may lead to new regulation in other jurisdiction or of other product regulator around the world increasingly look at each other approach to the regulation of the payment industry consequently development in any one country state or region may influence regulatory approach in other country state or region this includes the recent wall street reform and consumer protection act similarly new law and regulation in country state or region involving one product segment may cause lawmaker there to extend the regulation to another product for example regulation like those affecting debit payment could eventually spread to regulate credit result the risk created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential they have to be replicated affecting our business in another place or involving another product segment these include matter like interchange rate network exclusivity and preferred routing agreement conversely if widely varying regulation come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty adjusting our product service fee and other important aspect of our business with the effect either of these eventuality could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation government action may prevent from competing effectively against provider of domestic payment service in certain country materially and adversely affecting our ability to maintain or increase our revenue government in certain country provide resource or protection to selected national payment card and processing provider these government may take this action in order to support these provider they may also take this action to keep from entering these country to force to leave or to restrict substantially our activity there for example china significant emerging market ha increasingly tightened it rule requiring use of it payment system for domestic transaction additionally government in certain country are considering or may consider regulatory requirement that mandate processing of domestic payment entirely in that country this would prevent from utilizing our global processing capability for our client our effort to effect change in these country may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenue and extend our global brand regulation in the area of consumer privacy and data use and security could decrease the number of payment card issued our payment volume and our revenue recently privacy data use and security have received heightened legislative and regulatory focus in the united state at the federal and state level and in other country for example in many jurisdiction consumer must be notified in the event of data breach these measure may materially increase our cost and our client cost they may also decrease the number of our card our client issue this would materially and adversely affect our profitability in addition our failure or the failure of our client to comply with these law and regulation could result in fine sanction litigation and damage to our global reputation and our brand if government regulator determine that we are systemically important payment system we may have to change our settlement procedure or other operation making it costlier to operate our business and reducing our operational flexibility number of international initiative are underway to maintain financial stability by strengthening financial infrastructure the committee on payment and settlement system of the central bank of the group of ten country ha developed set of core principle for systemically important payment system government regulator in the united state or elsewhere may determine that we are table of content systemically important payment system and impose settlement risk management requirement on these could include new settlement procedure or other operational rule to address credit and operational risk they could also include new criterion for member participation and merchant access to our payment system any of these development could increase the cost of operating our business recent increased global regulatory focus on the payment industry may result in costly new compliance burden on our client and on leading to increased cost and decreased payment volume and revenue regulation of the payment industry ha increased significantly in recent year example include anti money laundering regulation the patriot act and similar law in other jurisdiction require to maintain comprehensive anti money laundering program treasury office of foreign asset control regulation regulation imposed by the treasury office of foreign asset control or ofac restrict from dealing with certain country and party considered to be connected with money laundering terrorism or narcotic non visa international member may not be similarly restricted so our payment system may be used for transaction in or involving country or party subject to ofac administered sanction potentially subjecting to penalty reputational damage or loss of business regulation of the price of credit many jurisdiction in which our card are used have new or proposed regulation that could increase the cost of card issuance or decrease the flexibility of card issuer to charge interest rate and fee on credit card account these include the credit card act and proposed regulation under it they also include proposed change to the federal truth in lending act which if implemented along with regulation required to be promulgated under the credit card act could result in decrease in our payment volume and revenue regulation of internet transaction proposed legislation in various jurisdiction may make it le desirable or more costly to complete internet transaction using our card by affecting the legality of those transaction the law that governs them their taxation and the allocation of intellectual property right and safety and soundness regulation recent federal banking regulation may make some financial institution le attracted to becoming an issuer of our card because they may be subject to more conservative accounting procedure increased risk management or higher capital requirement complying with these and other regulation may increase our cost similarly the impact of such regulation on our client may reduce the volume of payment we process moreover such regulation could limit the type of product and service that we offer the country in which our card are used and the type of cardholder and merchant can obtain or accept our card any of these occurrence could materially and adversely affect our business prospect for future growth financial condition and result of operation litigation risk finding of liability in the interchange litigation may result in substantial damage since approximately class action and individual complaint have been filed on behalf of merchant against mastercard and or other defendant including certain financial institution that issue visa branded payment card and acquire visa branded payment transaction in the we refer to this the interchange litigation among other antitrust allegation the plaintiff allege that table of content visa setting of default interchange rate violated federal and state antitrust law the lawsuit have been transferred to multidistrict litigation in the district court for the eastern district of new york the plaintiff in the interchange litigation seek damage for alleged overcharge in merchant discount fee well injunctive and other relief the consolidated class action complaint alleges that the plaintiff estimate that damage will range in the ten of billion of dollar because these lawsuit were brought under the federal antitrust law any actual damage will be trebled and we may be subject to joint and several liability among the defendant if liability is established this could significantly magnify the effect of any adverse judgment the interchange litigation is part of the covered litigation that our retrospective responsibility plan is intended to address the retrospective responsibility plan may not however adequately insulate from the impact of settlement of or judgment in the interchange litigation failure to successfully defend or settle the interchange litigation would result in liability that to the extent not covered by our retrospective responsibility plan could have material adverse effect on our financial condition result of operation and cash flow or in certain circumstance even cause to become insolvent in addition even if our retrospective responsibility plan covered our direct financial exposure settlement or judgment involving the multidistrict litigation could include restriction on our ability to conduct business which could increase our cost of business and limit our prospect for future growth see our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate from the impact of settlement and judgment in the covered litigation and will not insulate from other pending or future litigation and see note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item in this report our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate from the impact of settlement or final judgment our retrospective responsibility plan address monetary liability from settlement of or final judgment in the covered litigation which is described in note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report the retrospective responsibility plan consists of several related mechanism to fund settlement or judgment in the covered litigation these include an escrow account funded with portion of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and potential subsequent offering of our share of class common stock or deposit of cash to the escrow account in lieu of such offering loss sharing agreement and judgment sharing agreement in addition our member are obligated to indemnify pursuant to visa certificate of incorporation and bylaw and in accordance with their membership agreement these mechanism are unique and complicated and if we can not use one or more of them we could have difficulty funding the payment of settlement or final judgment against in covered litigation this could have material adverse effect on our financial condition result of operation and cash flow or in certain circumstance even cause to become insolvent the retrospective responsibility plan only address the covered litigation the plan doe not cover other pending litigation or any litigation that we may face in the future except for case that include claim for damage relating to the period prior to our initial public offering that are transferred for pre trial proceeding or otherwise included in the interchange litigation in addition our retrospective responsibility plan cover only the potential monetary liability from settlement of or judgment in the covered litigation non monetary settlement term and judgment in the covered litigation may require to modify the way we do business in the future this could adversely affect our revenue increase our expense and or limit our prospect for growth therefore even if our retrospective responsibility plan adequately safeguard from the monetary impact of settlement of and judgment in the covered litigation it may not insulate from all potential adverse consequence of them table of content if the settlement of our currency conversion case do not become final and we are unsuccessful in any of the various lawsuit relating to visa and visa international currency conversion practice our business may be materially and adversely affected visa and visa international are defendant in several state and federal lawsuit alleging that their currency conversion practice are or were deceptive anti competitive or otherwise unlawful on july and september visa and visa international entered into agreement to settle or otherwise dispose of these matter under the settlement agreement visa paid approximately million part of the defendant settlement fund for the federal action and approximately million to fund settlement of the state case although the federal court ha granted final approval of the settlement agreement the settlement are subject to resolution of any appeal if we are unsuccessful in any appellate proceeding all of the agreement resolving the federal and state action will terminate if that occurs and we are unsuccessful in defending against some or all of these lawsuit on the merit we may have to pay restitution damage or both and we may be required to modify our currency conversion practice the potential amount of damage restitution or both could be substantial in addition although we have substantially changed the practice at issue in these litigation court ordered change to our currency conversion and cross border transaction practice could materially and adversely affect our business see note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item in this report if we are found liable in certain other pending or future lawsuit we may have to pay substantial damage or change our business practice or pricing structure which may have material adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation like many large company we are defendant in number of civil action and investigation alleging violation of competition antitrust law security law consumer protection law or intellectual property law among others these lawsuit and investigation have been initiated by wide variety of party including the department of justice or the doj state attorney general merchant and consumer example of such claim are described more fully in note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item in this report some lawsuit involve complex claim that are subject to substantial uncertainty and unspecified damage therefore we can not ascertain the probability of loss or estimate the damage accordingly we have not established allowance for such legal proceeding in the united state private plaintiff often seek class action certification in case against this is particularly so in case involving merchant and consumer due to the size and scope of our business if we are found liable in large class action lawsuit monetary damage could be significant if we are unsuccessful in our defense against any material current or future proceeding we may have to pay substantial damage limit the fee we charge or change other business practice this could limit our payment volume and result in material and adverse effect on our revenue result of operation cash flow financial condition prospect for future growth and overall business and could even cause to become insolvent limitation on our business that resulted from litigation may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability certain limitation have been placed on our business in recent year because of litigation for example in october we reached settlement subject to court approval with the antitrust division of the doj and number of state attorney general relating to their investigation of certain visa merchant acceptance practice under the agreement visa will allow merchant to offer discount or other incentive to steer cardholder to particular form of payment including to specific table of content network brand or to any card product such non reward visa credit card see note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report the agreement doe not address surcharging or the setting of default interchange and doe not preclude the doj from pursuing future investigation of these or other topic similarly result of the june settlement of merchant lawsuit against visa merchant are able to reject our consumer debit card in the united state while still accepting other visa branded card and vice versa these and other limitation on our business that were the result of settlement of or judgment in litigation could limit the fee we charge and reduce our payment volume which could materially and adversely affect our revenue operating result prospect for future growth and overall business tax audit or dispute or change in the tax law applicable to could materially increase our tax payment we exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income tax and other tax liability although we believe our tax estimate are reasonable many factor may decrease their accuracy we are currently under audit by the internal revenue service and other tax authority and we may be subject to additional audit in the future the tax authority may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material item and thereby increase our tax liability in addition change in existing law such recent proposal for fundamental and international tax reform may also increase our effective tax rate substantial increase in our tax burden could have material adverse effect on our financial result see also note income tax to our consolidated financial statement included in item in this report our agreement with visa europe includes indemnity obligation that could expose to significant liability under our framework agreement with visa europe we indemnify it for loss resulting from all claim outside it region arising from our or their activity and relating to our or their payment business this obligation applies even if neither we nor any of our related party or agent participated in the action giving rise to such claim such an obligation could expose to significant liability for activity over which we have little or no control our retrospective responsibility plan would not cover these liability business risk the intense pressure we face on client pricing may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profit we offer incentive to client in order to increase payment volume enter new market segment and expand our card base these include up front cash payment fee discount credit performance based incentive marketing support payment and other support over the past several year we have increased the use of incentive such up front cash payment and fee discount in many country including the united state in order to stay competitive we may have to continue to increase our use of incentive this pressure may make the provision of certain product and service le profitable or unprofitable and materially and adversely affect our operating revenue and profitability pressure on client pricing also pose indirect risk presenting the potential for the same adverse effect if we continue to increase incentive to our client we will need to find way to offset the financial impact by increasing payment volume the amount of fee based service we provide or both we may not succeed in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment in addition we benefit from long term contract with certain client including those that are large contributor to our table of content revenue continued pressure on our fee could prevent from entering into such agreement in the future on favorable term we may also have to modify existing agreement in order to maintain relationship or comply with regulation finally increased pricing pressure enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiative in area other than those surrounding client incentive and we may not succeed in these effort our business financial condition and result of operation may suffer because of intense competition in our industry the global payment industry is intensely competitive our payment program compete against all form of payment these include cash check and electronic transaction such wire transfer and automatic clearinghouse payment in addition our payment program compete against the card based payment system of our competitor such mastercard american express discover and private label card issued by merchant some of our competitor may develop substantially greater financial and other resource than we have they may offer wider range of program and service than we do they may use advertising and marketing strategy that are more effective than ours achieving broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance than we do they may develop better security solution or more favorable pricing arrangement than we have they may also introduce more innovative program and service than we provide certain of our competitor operate with different business model have different cost structure or participate selectively in different market segment these include domestic network in the united state china canada australia and other country and region they may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to new regulatory technological and other development in many case these competitor have the support of government mandate that prohibit limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for or otherwise secure transaction within those country and region our client can reassess their commitment to at any time or develop their own competitive service this is especially so given the recent wall street reform and consumer protection act which restricts our ability to require network exclusivity in the debit sector most of our larger client relationship are not exclusive these include those with our largest client jpmorgan chase and bank of america in certain circumstance our client may terminate these relationship sometimes on relatively short notice and in many case subject to significant early termination fee because significant portion of our operating revenue is concentrated among our largest client our operating revenue would decline significantly if we lost one or more of them this could have material adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operation see note enterprise wide disclosure and concentration of business to our consolidated financial statement included in item in this report we expect there to be change in the competitive landscape in the future for example competitor client and others may develop product that compete with or replace the value added service we provide to support our transaction processing party that process our transaction in certain country may try to eliminate our position in the payment value chain participant in the payment industry may merge form joint venture or enter into other business combination that strengthen their existing business proposition or create new competing payment service or competition may increase from alternative type of payment service such mobile payment service online payment service and service that permit direct debit of consumer checking account or ach payment table of content our failure to compete effectively against any of these threat could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business disintermediation from the payment value chain would harm our business our position in the payment value chain underpins our business certain of our competitor including american express discover private label card network and certain alternative payment system operate closed loop payment system with direct connection to both merchant and consumer and no intermediary these competitor seek to derive competitive advantage from this business model in addition they have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practice operator of multi party payment system such ours we also run the risk of disintermediation by virtue of increasing bilateral agreement between entity that would rather not use payment network for processing payment for example merchant could process transaction directly with issuer or processor could process transaction directly between issuer and acquirer additional consolidation in the banking industry could result in our losing business and create pressure on the fee we charge our client materially and adversely affecting our revenue and profitability the banking industry ha recently undergone substantial accelerated consolidation which could continue significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in the acquisition of one or more of our largest client by an institution with strong relationship with one of our competitor this could result in the acquired bank visa business shifting to that competitor resulting in substantial loss of business to in addition one or more of our client could merge with or acquire one of our competitor shifting it payment volume to that competitor any such transaction could have material adverse effect on our business and prospect continued consolidation in the banking industry would also reduce the overall number of our client and potential client and could increase the negotiating power of our remaining client and potential client this consolidation could lead financial institution to seek greater pricing discount or other incentive with in addition consolidation could prompt our existing client to seek to renegotiate their pricing agreement with to obtain more favorable term we may also be adversely affected by price compression should one of our client absorb another financial institution and qualify for higher volume based discount on the combined volume of the merged business pressure on the fee we charge our client caused by such consolidation could materially and adversely affect our revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business in addition the current economic environment could lead some client to curtail or postpone near term investment in growing their card portfolio limit credit line or take other action that affect adversely the growth of our volume and revenue stream from these client merchant continued focus on the cost associated with payment card acceptance may result in more litigation regulation regulatory enforcement and incentive arrangement we rely in part on merchant and their relationship with our client to maintain and expand the acceptance of our payment card consolidation in the retail industry is producing group of larger merchant that is significant impact on all participant in the global payment industry some merchant are seeking to reduce their cost associated with payment card acceptance by lobbying for new legislation and regulatory enforcement and by bringing litigation if they continue these effort could materially and adversely affect our revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business table of content we along with our client negotiate pricing discount and other incentive arrangement with certain large merchant to increase acceptance and usage of our payment card if merchant continue to consolidate our client and we may have to increase the incentive provided to certain larger merchant this could materially and adversely affect our revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business competitive and regulatory pressure on pricing could make it difficult to offset the cost of these incentive certain financial institution have exclusive or nearly exclusive relationship with our competitor to issue payment card and these relationship may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenue certain financial institution have longstanding exclusive or nearly exclusive relationship with our competitor to issue payment card these relationship may make it difficult or cost prohibitive for to conduct material amount of business with them in order to increase our revenue in addition these financial institution may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our client which could put at competitive disadvantage failure to maintain relationship with our client and others and failure of client to provide service on our behalf could materially and adversely affect our business we depend and will continue to depend significantly on relationship with our client and on their relationship with cardholder and merchant to support our program and service we do not issue card extend credit to cardholder or determine the interest rate if any or other fee charged to cardholder using card that carry our brand each issuer determines these and most other competitive card feature in addition we do not generally solicit merchant to accept our card and we do not establish the discount rate charged to merchant for card acceptance which rate are the responsibility of acquirer result the success of our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our client and the strength of our relationship with them in many country outside the united state our client or other processor authorize clear and settle most domestic transaction using our payment card without involving our processing system in addition we do not generally have direct relationship with merchant and do not have direct relationship with cardholder consequently we depend on our close working relationship with our client to effectively manage the processing of transaction involving our card our inability to control the end to end processing for card carrying our brand in these country may put at competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to ensure the quality of the service supporting our brand in addition we depend on third party to provide various service on our behalf and to the extent that third party vendor fail to deliver service our business and reputation could be impaired our perception in the marketplace may affect our brand and reputation which are key asset of our business our brand and their attribute are key asset of our business the ability to attract and retain consumer cardholder and corporate client to visa branded product depends highly upon the external perception of our company and our industry our business may be affected by action taken by our client that change the perception of our brand from time to time our client may take action that we do not believe to be in the best interest of our brand such creditor practice that may be subject to challenge which may materially and adversely affect our business further visa europe ha broad latitude to operate the visa business in and use our brand and technology within visa europe region in which we have only limited control over the operation of the visa business visa europe is not required to spend any minimum amount of money promoting or building the visa brand table of content in it region and the strength of the visa global brand depends in part on the effort of visa europe to maintain product and service recognition and quality in europe finally adverse development with respect to our industry may also by association impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny unprecedented economic event in financial market around the world have and are likely to continue to affect our client merchant and cardholder resulting in material and adverse impact on our prospect growth profitability revenue and overall business the competitive and evolving nature of the global payment industry provides both challenge to and opportunity for the continued growth of our business unprecedented event that began in continue to affect the financial market around the world this includes decreased consumer spending increased unemployment deflation increased saving decreased debt excess housing inventory lowered government spending le export activity continued challenge in the credit environment continued equity market volatility additional government intervention and the uncertainty arising from new government policy this economic turmoil ha affected the economy of the united state and other mature economy in particular the fragility of the current situation would be exacerbated if additional negative economic development were to arise these could include among other thing policy misstep exhaustion of and other national economic stimulus package dramatic increase in oil price tax increase economic turmoil in china the euro zone or japan or significant decline in the commercial real estate market some existing client have been placed in receivership or administration or have significant amount of their stock owned by their government many financial institution are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence including potential change in law and regulation many of our client merchant that accept our brand and cardholder who use our brand have been directly and adversely affected our financial result may be negatively affected by action taken by individual financial institution or by governmental or regulatory body in response to the economic crisis the severity of the economic environment may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risk to our financial performance that have historically been present result our revenue growth ha been and may be negatively affected or we may be affected in several way including but not limited to the following constriction of consumer and business confidence may continue to decrease cardholder spending uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our client business may reduce the accuracy of our estimate of our revenue rebate

expense reduction which may reduce our revenue our client may decrease spending for optional or enhanced service affect our revenue and reduce cardholder desire to use these product government intervention or investment in our client may negatively affect our business with those institution or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our product tightening of credit availability could affect the ability of participating financial institution to lend to under the term of our credit facility table of content our client may default on their settlement obligation our business and prospect well our revenue and profitability could be materially and adversely affected by consolidation of our client in addition regulatory body may seek to impose rule and price control on certain aspect of our business and the payment industry any of these development could have material adverse impact on our prospect growth revenue profitability and overall business decline in non and cross border activity and in multi currency transaction could adversely affect our revenue and profitability we generate significant portion of our revenue from such transaction we generate significant amount of our revenue from cross border transaction our client pay fee in connection with cross border transaction some of those fee may differ if conversion from the merchant currency to the cardholder billing currency is required thus revenue from processing cross border transaction for our client fluctuates with cross border travel and the need for transaction to be converted into different currency cross border travel may be adversely affected by world geopolitical economic and other condition these include the threat of terrorism natural disaster the effect of climate change and outbreak of disease decline in cross border travel could adversely affect our revenue and profitability decline in the need for conversion of currency might also adversely affect our revenue and profitability in addition visa derives revenue from foreign currency exchange activity that result from our client settlement in different currency reduction in multi currency transaction may reduce the need for foreign currency exchange activity and adversely affect our revenue transaction outside the united state represent an increasingly important part of our strategy in order to continue to grow in those area we will need to ensure that we maintain consistency in the type of product we provide the quality of our service and the viability of our brand if we can not employ our organizational resource effectively we will be unable to do so finally because we are domiciled in the united state negative perception of the united state arising from it political or other position could harm the perception of our company and our brand any of these factor could materially and adversely affect our revenue operating result prospect for future growth and overall business we risk loss or insolvency if our client fail to fund settlement obligation we have guaranteed we indemnify issuer and acquirer for any settlement loss they suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to fund it daily settlement obligation in certain instance we may indemnify issuer or acquirer even in situation in which transaction is not processed by our system this indemnification creates settlement risk for due to the difference in timing between the date of payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement the term and amount of our indemnification obligation are unlimited concurrent settlement failure involving more than one of our largest client or several of our smaller client may exceed our available financial resource could systemic operational failure lasting more than single day any such failure could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation in addition even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover table of content settlement failure we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment this could expose to significant loss materially and adversely affecting our financial condition result of operation and cash flow we estimate settlement at risk or exposure based on the sum of three input the first is average daily volume during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of day to settle plus safety margin the second is four month of rolling average chargebacks volume the third is the total balance for outstanding traveler cheque additionally from time to time we review and revise our risk management methodology and input necessary see note settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report some of our client are composed of group of financial institution some of these client have elected to limit their responsibility for settlement loss arising from the failure of their constituent financial institution in exchange for managing their constituent financial institution in accordance with our credit risk policy to the extent that any settlement failure resulting from constituent financial institution exceeds the limit established by our credit risk policy we would have to absorb the cost of such settlement failure which could materially and adversely affect our cash flow if our transaction processing system are disrupted or we can not process transaction efficiently the perception of our brand and our revenue or operating result could be materially and adversely affected our transaction processing system may experience service interruption or degradation because of processing or other technology malfunction fire natural disaster power loss disruption in long distance or local telecommunication access fraud terrorism climate change or accident our visibility in the global payment industry may attract terrorist and hacker to conduct physical or computer based attack leading to an interruption in service increased cost or the compromise of data security additionally we rely on service provider for the timely transmission of information across our global data network if service provider fails to provide the communication capacity or service we require because of natural disaster operational disruption terrorism or any other reason the failure could interrupt our service adversely affect the perception of our brand reliability and materially reduce our revenue or profitability if we can not keep pace with rapid technological development to provide new and innovative payment program and service the use of our card could decline reducing our revenue and net income rapid significant technological change are confronting the payment industry these include development in smart card ecommerce mobile commerce and radio frequency and proximity payment device such contactless card we can not predict the effect of technological change on our business we rely in part on third party including some of our competitor and potential competitor for the development of and access to new technology we expect that new service and technology applicable to the payment industry will continue to emerge these new service and technology may be superior to or render obsolete the technology we currently use in our card product and service in addition our ability to adopt new service and technology that we develop may be inhibited by industry wide standard by resistance to change from client or merchant or by third party intellectual property right our success will depend in part on our ability to develop new technology and adapt to technological change and evolving industry standard account data breach involving card data stored by third party or by could adversely affect our reputation and revenue our client merchant others and we store cardholder account information in connection with our payment card in addition our client may use third party processor to process transaction table of content generated by card carrying our brand breach of the system storing sensitive cardholder data and account information could lead to fraudulent activity involving visa branded card to reputational damage and to claim against if we are sued in connection with any data security breach we could be involved in protracted litigation if unsuccessful in defending such lawsuit we may have to pay damage or change our business practice or pricing structure any of which could have material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability in addition any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach at one or more of our client merchant or other third party could decrease the use and acceptance of our card which could have material adverse impact on our payment volume revenue and future growth prospect finally any data security breach could result in additional regulation which could materially increase our cost an increase in fraudulent and other illegal activity involving our card could lead to reputational damage to our brand and reduce the use and acceptance of our card criminal are using increasingly sophisticated method to capture cardholder account information they use the information to conduct fraudulent transaction outsourcing and specialization of function within the payment system are increasing result more third party are involved in processing transaction using our card rise in fraud level involving our card could lead to reputational damage to our brand this could reduce the use and acceptance of our card or lead to greater regulation which could increase our compliance cost failure to maintain interoperability between visa inc and visa europe authorization and clearing and settlement system could damage the business and global perception of the visa brand before our reorganization in october visa europe and we shared authorization clearing and settlement system visa europe completed and substantially deployed it own system in the fiscal year result visa europe and we will have to ensure that the two system can process every transaction regardless of where it originates visa europe newly independent system operation could present challenge to our business due to the heightened difficulty of maintaining the interoperability of our respective system they diverge over time failure to authorize or clear and settle transaction quickly and accurately could impair the global perception of the visa brand risk related to our structure and organization we have little ability to control visa europe operation and limited recourse if it breach it obligation to visa europe ha very broad right to operate the visa business in it region under the agreement that governs our relationship if we want to change global rule or require visa europe to implement certain change that would not have positive return for visa europe and it member visa europe is not required to implement that rule or change unless we agree to pay for the implementation cost and expense that visa europe and it member will incur consequence of the implementation if visa europe fails to meet it obligation our remedy under this agreement are limited we can not terminate the agreement even upon visa europe material uncured breach although we have call right to acquire visa europe we can exercise that right under only extremely limited circumstance these and other feature of the license granted under the agreement may also raise issue concerning the characterization of the license for purpose of tax treatment of entry into the license and payment received thereunder table of content in some instance in the case of cybersource visa europe may have the right to control the activity of newly acquired entity within visa europe territory in any event visa europe exclusive license right in europe may hinder our ability to acquire new entity or to operate them effectively any inconsistency in the payment processing service and product that we can provide could negatively affect cardholder from visa europe using card in the country we serve or our cardholder using card in visa europe region if visa europe make acquire all of it outstanding stock we will incur substantial cost and may suffer material and adverse effect on our operation and net income we have granted visa europe put option requiring to purchase all outstanding capital stock from it member if exercised we will incur substantial financial obligation if visa europe exercise this option visa europe may do so at any time we may need to obtain third party financing in order to meet our obligation by either borrowing fund or selling stock an equity offering or the payment of part of the exercise price in our stock would dilute the ownership interest of our stockholder we would have only day to pay the exercise price sufficient financing might not be available to within that time on reasonable term see note visa europe to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report if visa europe exercise the put option we may encounter difficulty in integrating visa europe business and system into our existing operation if we can not do so quickly and cost effectively the integration could divert the time and attention of senior management disrupt our current operation and adversely affect our result of operation in addition we would become subject to the many regulation of the european union that govern the operation of visa europe including any regulatory dispute we are required to record quarterly any change in the fair value of the put option we record these adjustment through our consolidated statement of operation consequently the adjustment affect our reported net income and earnings per share these quarterly adjustment and their resulting impact on our reported statement of operation could be significant the existence of these change could adversely affect our ability to raise capital or the cost involved in raising it if we can not remain organizationally effective we will be unable to address the opportunity and challenge presented by our strategy and by the increasingly challenging competitive economic and regulatory environment since our reorganization in october we have increasingly centralized our management and operation for to succeed we must effectively integrate our operation actively work to ensure consistency throughout our organization and avoid centric thinking if we fail to do so we may be unable to expand rapidly we plan and the result of our expansion may be unsatisfactory in addition the current competitive economic and regulatory environment will require our organization to adapt rapidly and nimbly to new opportunity and challenge we will be unable to do so if we do not make important decision quickly enough define our appetite for risk specifically enough implement new governance managerial and organizational process smoothly enough and communicate role and responsibility clearly enough we may be unable to attract and retain key management and other key employee our employee particularly our key management are vital to our success and difficult to replace we may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employee particularly if we do not offer employment term

exclusive license granted to visa europe in most acquisition and major investment that involve country in the visa europe territory regulatory constraint particularly competition regulation may affect the extent to which we can maximize the value of acquisition or investment furthermore the integration of any acquisition or investment may divert management time and resource from our core business and disrupt our operation we may spend time and money on project that do not increase our revenue moreover our cash reserve contract to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition or investment in cash although we periodically evaluate potential acquisition of and investment in business product and technology and anticipate continuing to make these evaluation we can not guarantee that we will be able to execute and integrate any such acquisition and investment future sale of our class common stock or the expiration or waiver of transfer restriction on our class and common stock could result in dilution to holder of share of our existing class common stock adversely affecting their right and depressing the market price of our class common stock the market price and voting power of our class common stock could decline because of increase in the number of such share outstanding the market price of our class common stock may also suffer from the perception that

consolidated financial statement and related note included in item overview visa is global payment technology company that connects consumer business bank and government around the world enabling them to use digital currency instead of cash and check we provide financial institution with payment processing platform that encompass consumer credit debit prepaid and commercial payment we facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institution merchant consumer business and government entity each of these constituency ha played key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper based to electronic form of payment and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunity particularly outside the united state we continue to explore additional opportunity to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment service to benefit our existing client and to position visa to serve more and different constituency overall economic condition and regulatory environment our business is affected by overall economic condition and consumer spending we continue to monitor the progress of the global economic recovery which ha shown sign of slow but gradual improvement we expect consumer and commercial spending and our payment volume to continue to increase in the near term if the economic recovery maintains momentum the wall street reform and consumer protection act enacted in the in july includes provision that will establish regulation and oversight of debit interchange rate and certain other network industry practice in the while the legislation doe not directly regulate the network fee we charge except to ensure that fee are not used to evade the new regulation of interchange rate it may give retailer greater ability to route debit transaction onto competitive network which can reduce the processing fee we currently earn on debit transaction because the implementation detail for this new legislation will be determined over the next year the expected impact on our consolidated financial statement is unknown at this time however we expect to see the impact of the legislation beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal other regulatory measure previously enacted in the became effective in the second quarter of fiscal these regulatory measure primarily impacted our client but have not resulted in any notable impact to our payment volume we continue to believe that our broad platform of payment product provides substantial value to both retailer and consumer and that the continuing worldwide secular shift to digital currency will buffer the impact of our current regulatory environment reflected in our overall payment volume growth and in particular payment volume growth outside the funding of the litigation escrow account during may and subsequently in october after our fiscal year end we deposited million and million

expand our online payment fraud and security management capability and is expected to accelerate our growth in the ecommerce category the result of cybersource are included in our result from the acquisition date see note cybersource acquisition to our consolidated financial statement nominal payment volume and transaction count we believe that payment volume and processed transaction are key driver of our business payment volume is the basis for service revenue and processed transaction are the basis for data processing revenue the growth in nominal payment volume in fiscal compared to fiscal in particular credit and debit wa primarily driven by growth outside the comparing fiscal with fiscal nominal payment volume declined in credit and commercial product which wa offset by growth in debit resulting in minimal year over year nominal payment volume impact the number of processed transaction continues to increase reflecting the continued shift to electronic payment globally the

change in million except percentage operating revenue rest of world operating revenue visa europe operating revenue total operating revenue percentage change calculated based on whole number not rounded number table of content growth in operating revenue primarily reflects an increase in nominal payment volume continued growth of processed transaction and the impact of pricing modification made on various service result of innovation in our product line and improvement in our service model the benefit of pricing modification are partially offset by increase to volume and support incentive we continue to monitor the progress of nominal payment volume growth part of the overall global economic recovery and evaluate the potential impact to operating revenue under our current regulatory environment we may adjust our pricing strategy to ensure that it competitively aligns with the value and growth opportunity provided to our client revenue from processing cross border transaction for our client fluctuate with cross border travel and the extent to which visa branded product are utilized for travel purpose cross border transaction have shown sign of improvement in all geography during fiscal our operating revenue primarily service revenue and international transaction revenue are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the dollar payment volume and related revenue denominated in local or regional currency are converted to dollar the effect of the general weakening of the dollar during fiscal wa moderated by our hedging activity resulting in net increase in total operating revenue in comparison the general strengthening of the dollar during fiscal net against the impact from our hedging activity resulted in decline in total operating revenue we are substantially hedged through fiscal we do not expect any significant impact from currency fluctuation next year the following table set forth the component of our total operating revenue fiscal year endedseptember change change in million except percentage service revenue data processing revenue international transaction revenue other revenue volume and support incentive total operating revenue percentage change calculated based on whole number not rounded number service revenue increased in fiscal primarily due to growth in nominal payment volume the growth in service revenue wa slower than the growth in nominal payment volume primarily reflecting difference in the geographic mix of our service revenue and the impact of our hedging program against the weakening dollar we expect service revenue to increase in fiscal we continue to align our pricing strategy across the globe to ensure it reflects the competitive value and growth opportunity provided to our client service revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to strategic pricing modification implemented in the second half of fiscal combined with modest growth of in nominal global payment volume data processing revenue increased during fiscal due to competitive pricing action across various geography which became effective in the second half of fiscal combined with growth of in the number of transaction processed data processing table of content revenue also benefitted slightly from the inclusion of cybersource activity since the july acquisition we do not believe that the current rate of growth in data processing revenue is representative of sustainable future revenue growth due to the inclusion of these pricing action which have largely anniversaried in the fourth quarter of fiscal however we will benefit from the inclusion of full year cybersource activity in fiscal data processing revenue increased in fiscal due to growth in the number of transaction processed during the year combined with other strategic pricing modification international transaction revenue increased in fiscal primarily due to growth of in nominal cross border payment volume combined with strategic pricing modification which took place after the third quarter of fiscal we generally expect international transaction revenue to grow in line with increased cross border transaction volume although economic downturn or other adverse international condition could hinder this growth international transaction revenue increased in fiscal despite an decline in cross border nominal payment volume primarily due to strategic pricing modification made after fiscal other revenue increased during fiscal primarily due to license fee from cielo formerly known companhia brasileira de meios de pagamento or visanet do brasil for the use of visa trademark and technology intellectual property we entered into this licensing arrangement with visanet do brasil following it initial public offering and the sale of our equity interest in the third quarter of fiscal the increase also reflects growth in other new license and royalty fee other revenue increased in fiscal primarily due to growth in the visa extra loyalty platform for administrative and reward fulfillment service performed in support of the platform volume and support incentive increased in fiscal primarily due to growth in global payment volume and incentive incurred on significant long term customer contract that were initiated or renewed in fiscal these increase were offset by lower one time incentive incurred for early renewal compared to fiscal anticipated volume and support incentive percentage of gross revenue were approximately in fiscal we expect incentive percentage of gross revenue to be in the range of to for the full fiscal year the actual amount of volume and support incentive will vary based on modification to performance expectation for these contract amendment to

exercised will require to purchase all of the outstanding share of capital stock of visa europe from it member visa europe may exercise the put option at any time the put option provides formula for determining the purchase price of the visa europe share which subject to certain adjustment applies visa inc forward price to earnings multiple or the ratio defined in the option agreement at the time the option is exercised to visa europe adjusted sustainable income for the forward month period or the adjusted sustainable income the calculation of visa europe adjusted sustainable income under the term of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustment for cost synergy and other negotiated item upon exercise the key input to this formula including visa europe adjusted sustainable income will be the result of negotiation between and visa europe the put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two party are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price table of content at september we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately million while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september it doe not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised the purchase price we could be obligated to pay day after exercise will represent substantial financial obligation which could be several billion dollar or more we may need to obtain third party financing either by borrowing fund or undertaking subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment the amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on among other thing visa europe adjusted sustainable income and our ratio in each case negotiated at the time the put option is exercised given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic condition which could be present at the time of exercise our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise can not be reliably estimated the following table calculates our total obligation assuming for illustrative purpose only range of ratio for visa inc and assuming that visa europe demonstrates million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise the million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below for illustrative purpose only is based on visa europe forecasted financial result for the year ended september however this doe not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income visa europe would have been able to demonstrate at september or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future should visa europe elect to exercise it option we believe it is likely that it will implement change in it business operation to move to for profit model in order to maximize adjusted sustainable income and result to increase the purchase price the table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout assuming the same range of estimated ratio for each million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed million demonstrated at the time of exercise at september our estimated long term ratio wa and the long term differential the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to visa europe wa at september the spot ratio wa and the spot differential the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to visa europe wa these ratio are for reference purpose only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future visa inc forward price to earnings ratio payout assuming adjusted sustainable income of million increase decrease in payout for each million of adjusted sustainable income above below million in million in million given the large range of different economic environment and circumstance under which visa europe could decide to exercise it option the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollar or more pension and other postretirement benefit we sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plan which generally provide benefit based on year of service age and eligible compensation employee hired before january earn benefit based on their pay during their last five year of employment employee hired

but ha the positive impact of reducing future period expense for the plan in fiscal and we made contribution to our pension and other postretirement plan of million million and million respectively in fiscal we anticipate to fund our defined benefit pension plan and postretirement plan by approximately million the actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan movement in the discount rate performance of the plan asset and related tax consequence capital expenditure our capital expenditure decreased during fiscal reflecting the completion of our new east coast data center in fiscal the new data center support our technology objective related to reliability scalability security and new product development we expect capital expenditure to be

entity to maximize the use of observable input and minimize the use of unobservable input when measuring fair value observable input are obtained from independent source and can be validated by third party whereas unobservable input reflect assumption regarding third party would use in pricing an asset or liability of september our financial instrument measured at fair value on recurring basis included approximately billion of asset of which million or le than had significant unobservable input for these instrument we lacked observable market data to corroborate either the non binding market consensus price or the non binding broker quote at september debt instrument in this category included auction rate security see note investment and fair value measurement to our consolidated financial statement balance sheet arrangement our off balance sheet arrangement primarily comprise guarantee visa ha no off balance sheet debt other than lease and purchase order commitment discussed

consolidated financial statement contractual obligation our contractual commitment will have an impact on our future liquidity the contractual obligation identified in the table below include both on

generated from our operation and available credit facility see note visa europe note debt note pension postretirement and other benefit note commitment and contingency and note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement payment due by period le year more year total in million purchase order lease volume and support incentive marketing and sponsorship litigation settlement payment debt other total represents agreement to purchase good and service that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify significant term including fixed or minimum quantity to be purchased and fixed

increase payment product acceptance these agreement which range in term from one to thirteen year provide card issuance marketing and program support based on specific performance requirement payment under these agreement will be offset by revenue earned from higher corresponding payment and transaction volume these payment amount are estimate and will change based on customer performance execution of new contract or amendment to existing contract related amount disclosed in note commitment and contingency to our consolidated financial statement represent the associated expected future reduction of revenue related to these agreement visa is party to contractual sponsorship agreement ranging from approximately three year to sixteen year these contract are designed to help increase visa branded card and volume over the life of these contract visa is required to make payment in exchange for certain table of content advertising and promotional right in connection with these contractual commitment visa ha an obligation to spend certain minimum amount for advertising and marketing promotion over the contract term for obligation where the individual year of spend are not specified in the contract we have estimated the timing of when these amount will be spent includes dividend amount of million dividend were declared on october and will be paid on december to all holder of record of visa common stock of november we have liability for uncertain tax position of million net of offsetting tax benefit associated with the corresponding effect of state and foreign income tax at september we also accrued million of interest and million of penalty associated with our uncertain tax position we can not determine the range of cash payment that will be made and the timing of the cash settlement associated with our uncertain tax position therefore no amount related to these obligation have been included in the table visa granted perpetual put option to visa europe which if exercised will require to purchase all of the outstanding share of capital stock of visa europe from it member due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic condition which could exist when the put is exercised the ultimate amount and timing of visa obligation if any can not be reliably estimated therefore no amount related to this obligation have been included in the table the fair value of the visa europe put option totaling million at september ha also been excluded from this table it doe not represent the amount or an estimate of the amount of visa obligation in the event of exercise see liquidity and critical accounting estimate section of this management discussion and analysis and note visa europe to our consolidated financial statement we evaluate the need to make contribution to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan movement in the discount rate performance of the plan asset and related tax consequence expected contribution to our pension plan have not been included in the table such amount are dependent upon the consideration discussed above and may result in wide range of amount see note pension postretirement and other benefit to our consolidated financial statement critical accounting estimate our consolidated financial statement are prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america which requires to make judgment assumption and estimate that affect the amount reported see note summary of significant accounting policy to our consolidated financial statement we have established policy and control procedure which seek to ensure that estimate and assumption are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period however actual result could differ from our assumption and estimate and such difference could be material we believe that the following accounting estimate are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial result they require our most subjective or complex management judgment resulting from the need to make estimate about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable revenue recognition volume and support incentive critical estimate we enter into incentive agreement with client merchant and other business partner to build payment volume and to increase product acceptance these incentive are generally accounted for reduction of operating revenue or expense where an identifiable benefit can be identified certain volume and support incentive are based on performance target and are accrued systematically and rationally based upon estimate of future performance other incentive are based table of content on fixed payment and are generally deferred if certain criterion are met the deferability criterion include the existence of future benefit to visa the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clause management ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clause and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of the deferred amount capitalized amount are amortized over the period of contractual recoverability assumption and judgment estimation of volume and support incentive relies on forecast of payment volume estimate of card issuance and card conversion performance is estimated using customer reported information transactional information accumulated from our system historical information and discussion with our client impact if actual result differ from assumption if our client actual performance or recoverable cash flow are not consistent with our estimate volume and support incentive may be materially different than initially recorded increase in incentive payment are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume result in the event incentive payment exceed estimate such payment are not expected to have material effect on our financial condition result of operation or cash flow the cumulative impact of revision in estimate is recorded in the period such revision become probable and estimable for the year ended september performance adjustment to volume and support agreement were le than of our total operating revenue fair value visa europe put option critical estimate we have granted visa europe perpetual put option under which if exercised we are required to purchase all of the share capital of visa europe from it member at any time the put option provides formula for determining the purchase price of the visa europe share which subject to certain adjustment applies visa inc forward price to earnings multiple defined in the agreement at the time the option is exercised to visa europe adjusted sustainable income for the forward month period or the adjusted sustainable income the calculation of visa europe adjusted sustainable income under the term of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustment for cost synergy and other negotiated item upon exercise the key input to this formula including visa europe adjusted sustainable income will be the result of negotiation between the company and visa europe the put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two party are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price see note visa europe to our consolidated financial statement for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement the fair value of visa europe option wa estimated to be approximately million at september while the put option is in fact non transferable this amount recorded in our financial statement represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay third party market participant to transfer the put option in an orderly transaction at the measurement date the fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price under the term of the put agreement to the estimated fair value of visa europe the fair value of visa europe is defined the estimated amount third party market participant might pay in an arm length transaction under normal business condition probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that visa europe will never exercise it option while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september it doe not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised which could be several billion dollar or more see the liquidity and capital resource section of management discussion and analysis for further discussion table of content assumption and judgment the most significant estimate used in the valuation of the fair value of the put option are the assumed probability that visa europe will elect to exercise it option and the estimated differential between the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock defined in the put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe on standalone basis at the time of exercise which we refer to the differential probability of exercise exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of visa europe on behalf of the visa europe shareholder pursuant to authority granted to visa europe under it article of association we estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including but not limited to visa europe stated intention ii indication that visa europe is preparing to exercise reflected in it reported financial result iii evaluation of market condition including the regulatory environment that could impact the potential future profitability of visa europe and iv qualitative factor applicable to visa europe largest member which could indicate change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holding differential the differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock defined in the put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe at the time of exercise for valuation purpose the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measure and qualitative factor quantitatively we estimate our ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding month the long term calculation and the last trading date the day calculation prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the month starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date this median earnings estimate is obtained from the institutional broker estimate system we then determine the best estimate of our long term price to earnings multiple for valuation purpose by qualitatively evaluating the day calculation compared to the long term calculation in this evaluation we examine both measure to determine whether difference if any are the result of fundamental change in long term value of the company or the result of short term market volatility or other non company specific market factor that may not be indicative of our long term forward we believe given the perpetual nature of the put option that market participant would more heavily weight long term value indicator opposed to short term indicator factor that might indicate fundamental change in long term value include but are not limited to change in the regulatory environment client portfolio long term growth rate or new product innovation consistent methodology is applied to group of comparable public company used to estimate the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to visa europe these estimate therefore are impacted by change in stock price and the financial market expectation of the future earnings of visa inc and the comparable company other estimate of lesser significance applied include growth rate and foreign currency exchange rate applied in the calculation of visa europe adjusted sustainable income the valuation model assumes large range of annual growth rate reflecting the different economic environment and circumstance under which visa europe could decide to exercise the lowest growth rate assumed reflect visa europe current business model an association owned by it member bank while the highest reflect successful shift to for profit model in anticipation of exercise the scenario with higher growth rate are assigned significantly higher probability in the valuation model we believe market participant would more heavily weight these scenario it is likely that should it choose to exercise it option visa europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting for profit business model in advance of exercising the put option the foreign exchange rate used to translate visa europe result from euro to dollar reflects blend of forward exchange rate observed in the marketplace the assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled table of content scenario is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation obligation calculated in later year are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value impact if actual result differ from assumption in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september we have assumed probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and differential at the time of exercise of approximately the use of probability of exercise that is higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option an increase of in the assumed differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option the put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of visa europe such the put option liability is included in accrued liability on our consolidated balance sheet at september classification in current liability is not an indication of management expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within month fair value goodwill and intangible asset critical estimate we are required to estimate the fair value and useful life of asset acquired and liability assumed including intangible asset in business combination the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the asset acquired and liability assumed is goodwill we are subsequently required to ass asset acquired and goodwill for impairment assumption and judgment judgment used in the valuation of asset and liability assumed in business combination including goodwill and intangible asset can include the cash flow that an asset is expected to generate the weighted average cost of capital and discount rate determined by management we believe that the assumption made are comparable to those that market participant would use in making estimate of fair value determining the expected life of an intangible asset requires management judgment and is based on the evaluation of various factor including the competitive environment market share customer history and macroeconomic situation we determined that our visa brand customer relationship and visa europe franchise right are intangible asset with indefinite life based on our significant market share history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and historical retention rate result of acquiring cybersource in july we acquired intangible asset comprising customer relationship tradenames and reseller relationship which we determined have finite useful life ranging from to year see note cybersource acquisition and note intangible asset net to our consolidated financial statement our asset acquired liability assumed and related goodwill are assigned to respective reporting unit and goodwill impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level indefinite lived intangible asset annually or whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that impairment may exist we test each category of indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment on an aggregate basis which may require the allocation of cash flow and or an estimate of fair value to those asset or asset group impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is le than the carrying value we rely on number of factor when completing impairment assessment including review of discounted future cash flow business plan and use of present value technique of july we evaluated our indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment and concluded there wa no impairment of that date no recent event or change in circumstance indicate that impairment may exist thereafter reflected by the overall performance of our business and market capitalization finite lived intangible asset we evaluate the recoverability of finite lived intangible asset for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable if the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flow is le than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group an impairment loss is recognized the loss is table of content measured the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds it fair value no event or change in circumstance indicate that finite lived intangible asset were impaired of september goodwill review of goodwill impairment is completed annually or whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that impairment may exist goodwill impairment is reviewed using two step process that involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying value and comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we rely on number of factor when completing impairment assessment including review of discounted future cash flow business plan and use of present value technique we evaluated our goodwill for impairment on july and concluded there wa no impairment of that date subsequent to this annual assessment we completed the cybersource acquisition on july which resulted in an additional billion in goodwill and established second reporting unit we allocate goodwill to reporting unit based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition of the billion approximately billion wa allocated to the second reporting unit the remainder wa allocated to our original reporting unit to reflect the incremental growth and synergy this acquisition will provide to our existing business no recent event or change in circumstance indicate that impairment exist reflected by the business performance of our reporting unit and overall market capitalization impact if actual result differ from assumption if actual result are not consistent with our assumption and estimate we may be exposed to impairment charge the carrying value of goodwill and intangible asset net were billion and billion respectively including billion of indefinite lived intangible asset and million of finite lived intangible asset net at september legal and regulatory matter critical estimate we are currently involved in various legal proceeding the outcome of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged period of time management is required to ass the probability of loss and amount of such loss if any in preparing our financial statement assumption and judgment we evaluate the likelihood of potential loss from legal or regulatory proceeding to which we are party we record liability for such claim when loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgment are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceeding the merit of our defense and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claim and may revise our estimate our retrospective responsibility plan only address monetary liability from settlement of or final judgment in the covered litigation the plan mechanism include the use of the litigation escrow account the accrual related to covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance we did not record an additional accrual for covered litigation during fiscal see note retrospective responsibility plan to our consolidated financial statement impact if actual result differ from assumption due to the inherent uncertainty of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdiction in which we operate our judgment may be materially different than the actual outcome which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation see note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement table of content income tax critical estimate in calculating our effective tax rate we make judgment regarding certain tax position including the timing and amount of deduction and allocation of income among various tax jurisdiction assumption and judgment we have various tax filing position with regard to the timing and amount of deduction and credit the establishment of reserve for audit matter and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdiction we are also required to inventory evaluate and measure all uncertain tax position taken or to be taken on tax return and to record liability for the amount of such position that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority impact if actual result differ from assumption although we believe that our estimate and judgment are reasonable actual result may differ from these estimate some or all of these judgment are subject to review by the taxing authority including our current and deferred tax benefit associated with the settlement of the american express litigation and the discover litigation and other matter see note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement if one or more of the taxing authority were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit it could have material and adverse effect on our financial result and cash flow quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse change in market factor our exposure to financial market risk result primarily from fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and equity price cash and cash equivalent are not considered to be subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short period of time to maturity aggregate risk exposure are monitored on an ongoing basis we do not hold or enter into derivative or other financial instrument for trading or speculative purpose foreign currency exchange rate risk although most of our activity are transacted in dollar we are exposed to adverse fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation are primarily related to adverse change in the dollar value of revenue generated from foreign currency denominated transaction and adverse change in the dollar value of payment in foreign currency primarily for expense at our non location we manage these risk by entering into foreign currency forward contract with cash flow hedge accounting designation that hedge exposure of the variability in the dollar equivalent of anticipated non dollar denominated cash flow our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces but doe not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movement we utilize rolling hedge strategy program to reduce the exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposure of revenue derived from and payment made in foreign currency during the immediately following month the aggregate notional amount of our foreign currency forward contract outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program wa million and million at september and september respectively the aggregate notional amount of million outstanding at september is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below predetermined and approved threshold however actual result for this period could materially differ from our forecast the effect of hypothetical change of the dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately million on our foreign currency forward contract outstanding at september see note derivative financial instrument to our consolidated financial statement table of content we are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activity this risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with client relative to the timing of market trade for balancing currency position risk in settlement activity is limited through daily operating procedure including the utilization of visa settlement system and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties interest rate risk our investment portfolio asset are held in both fixed rate and adjustable rate security these asset are included in cash equivalent short term available for sale investment and long term available for sale investment investment in fixed rate instrument carry degree of interest rate risk the fair value of fixed rate security may be adversely impacted due to rise in interest rate additionally falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because security mature the proceeds are reinvested at lower rate generating le interest income historically we have been able to hold investment until maturity our operating result or cash flow have not been and are not expected to be materially impacted by sudden change in market interest rate the fair value balance of our fixed rate investment security in fiscal and were million and million respectively hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rate would not have material impact on our investment portfolio at september the fair value balance of our adjustable rate debt security were million and million at september and respectively we also have fixed rate debt which is subject to interest rate risk hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rate would have impacted the fair value of the debt by approximately million at september visa europe put option we have liability related to the put option with visa europe which is recorded at fair market value at september we are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on quarterly basis in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september we have assumed probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and differential at the time of exercise of approximately the use of probability of exercise higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option an increase of in the assumed differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option see liquidity and capital resource and critical accounting estimate above pension plan risk our defined benefit pension plan asset were million and million and projected benefit obligation were million and million at september and september respectively material adverse decline in the value of pension plan asset and or the discount rate for benefit obligation would result in decrease in the funded status of the plan an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding we will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan asset and market condition we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the plan for
