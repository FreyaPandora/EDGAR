the aca to continue to significantly impact it business operation and result of operation including pricing medical benefit ratio mbrs and the geography in which the company product are available while most of the significant aspect of the aca became effective during or prior to part of the aca continue to evolve through the promulgation of executive order regulation and guidance well ongoing litigation additional change to the aca and those regulation and guidance at the federal and or state level are likely and those change are likely to be significant growing federal and state budgetary pressure make it more likely that any change including change at the state level in response to change to or invalidation repeal or replacement of the aca and or change in the funding level and or payment mechanism of federally supported benefit program will be adverse to for example if any element of the aca are invalidated or repealed at the federal level the company expects that some state would seek to enact similar requirement such prohibiting pre existing condition exclusion prohibiting rescission of insurance coverage requiring coverage for dependent up to age requiring guaranteed renewability of insurance coverage and prohibiting lifetime limit on insurance coverage page expansion of health care coverage contemplated by the aca is being funded in part by reduction to the reimbursement the company and other health plan are paid by the federal government for medicare member among other source while not all inclusive the following are some of the key provision of the aca assuming it continues to be implemented in it current form that become effective on or january the company continues to evaluate these provision and the related regulation and regulatory guidance to determine the impact that they will have on it business operation and result of operation the imposition on the company and other health insurer health plan and other market participant of significant fee assessment and tax including an annual non tax deductible industry wide hif that wa billion for and ha been suspended for currently enacted the hif will apply for be higher for than for and

the aca also specifies minimum medical loss ratio mlrs for commercial and medicare insured product specifies feature required to be included in commercial benefit design limit commercial individual and small group rating and pricing practice encourages additional competition including potential incentive for new market entrant and significantly increase federal and state oversight of health plan including regulation and process that could delay or limit the company ability to appropriately increase it health plan premium rate this in turn could adversely affect the company ability to continue to participate in certain product line and or geography that it serf today potential repeal of the aca ongoing legislative regulatory and administrative policy change to the aca the result of congressional and state level election the december district court decision invalidating the aca and other pending litigation challenging aspect of the law or funding for the law and federal budget negotiation continue to create uncertainty about the ultimate impact of the aca the pending litigation challenging the aca includes challenge by various state of the federal government decision to curtail payment related to the cost sharing subsidy program the time frame for conclusion and final outcome and ultimate impact of this litigation are uncertain given the inherent difficulty of foreseeing the nature and scope of future change to the aca and state business and individual will respond to those change the company can not predict the impact on it of future change to the aca it is reasonably possible that invalidation repeal or replacement of or other change to the aca and or state response to such change in the aggregate could have significant adverse effect on the company business result of operation and cash flow medicare regulation the company medicare advantage product compete directly with original medicare and medicare advantage product offered by other medicare advantage organization and medicare supplement product offered by other insurer the company medicare pdp and medicare supplement product are product that medicare beneficiary who are enrolled in original medicare purchase to enhance their original medicare coverage the company continues to expand the number of county in which it offer medicare product the company expects to further expand it medicare service area and product in and is seeking to substantially grow it medicare membership revenue and result of operation over the next several year including through growth in medicare supplement product the anticipated organic expansion of the medicare service area and medicare product offered and the medicare related provision of the aca significantly increase the company exposure to funding and regulation of and change in government policy with respect to and or funding or regulation of the various medicare program in which the company participates including change in the amount payable to under those program and or new reform or surcharge on existing program for example since the contract year the aca ha required minimum mlrs for medicare advantage and medicare part plan of if medicare advantage or medicare part contract pay minimum mlr rebate for three consecutive year it will become ineligible to enroll new member if medicare advantage contract pay rebate for five consecutive year it will be terminated by cm the company medicare advantage and pdp product are heavily regulated by cm the regulation and contractual requirement applicable to the company and other private participant in medicare program are complex expensive to comply with and subject to change for example in the second quarter of cm issued final rule implementing the aca requirement that medicare advantage and pdp plan report and refund to cm overpayment that those plan receive from cm the precise interpretation impact and legality of this rule are not clear and are subject to pending litigation payment the company receives from cm for it medicare advantage and part business also are subject to risk adjustment based on the health status of the individual enrolled element of that risk adjustment mechanism continue to be challenged by the doj the office of inspector general oig and cm itself substantial change in the risk adjustment mechanism including change page result from enforcement or audit action could materially affect the fairness of the company medicare reimbursement require the company to raise price or reduce the benefit offered to medicare beneficiary and

expects cm and the oig to continue auditing risk adjustment data the company also ha received civil investigative demand cid from and provided document and information to the civil division of the doj in connection with current investigation of it patient chart review process in connection with risk adjustment data submission under part and of the medicare program on october cm issued proposed rule related to among other thing change to the radv audit methodology established by cm in cm project that the change to the radv audit methodology would increase it recovery from medicare advantage plan result of radv audit cm ha requested comment on the proposed rule including whether the proposed radv rule change apply retroactively to audit of medicare advantage plan for contract year and forward the company is evaluating the potential adverse effect which could be material on the company result of operation financial condition and cash flow if the proposed radv rule change were adopted proposed cm also ha announced it intent to use third party auditor to attain it ultimate goal of subjecting all medicare advantage contract to either comprehensive or targeted radv audit for each contract year portion of each medicare advantage plan reimbursement is tied to the plan star rating the star rating system considers variety of measure adopted by cm including quality of preventative service chronic illness management compliance and overall customer satisfaction only medicare advantage plan with an overall star rating of four or more star out of five star are eligible for quality bonus in their basic premium rate result the company medicare advantage plan result of operation in and going forward will be significantly affected by their star rating the company star rating and past performance score are adversely affected by the compliance issue that arise each year in it medicare operation cm released the company star rating in october the company star rating will be used to determine which of it medicare advantage plan have rating of four star or higher and qualify for bonus payment in based on the company membership at december of it medicare advantage member were in plan with star rating of at least star cm will release updated star rating in october that will be used to determine which medicare advantage plan have rating of four star or higher and qualify for bonus payment in cm also give pdps star rating which affect pdp enrollment and result in contract termination if the pdp is rated le than three star for three consecutive year cm continues to revise it star rating system to make it harder to achieve four star or more despite the company success in maintaining high star rating and other quality measure for and the continuation of it improvement effort there can be no assurance that it will be successful in maintaining or improving it star rating in future year accordingly the company medicare advantage plan may not be eligible for full level quality bonus which could adversely affect the benefit such plan can offer reduce membership and or reduce profit margin overall the company project the benchmark payment rate in cm april final notice detailing final medicare advantage benchmark payment rate for the final notice will increase funding for the company medicare advantage business excluding the impact of coding trend by approximately percent in compared to this rate increase only partially offset the challenge the company face from the impact of the increasing cost of medical care including prescription medication and cm local and national coverage decision that require the company to pay for service and supply that are not factored into the company bid the federal government may seek to impose restriction on the configuration of pharmacy or other provider network for medicare advantage and or pdp plan or otherwise restrict the ability of these plan to alter benefit negotiate price or establish other term to improve affordability or maintain viability of product the company currently belief that the payment received and will receive in the near term are adequate to justify page company continued participation in the medicare advantage and pdp program although there are economic and political pressure to continue to reduce spending on the program and this outlook could change going forward the company expects cm the oig the doj other federal agency and the united state congress to continue to scrutinize closely each component of the medicare program including medicare advantage pdp demonstration project such medicare medicaid plan and provider network access and adequacy modify the term and requirement of the program and possibly seek to recast or limit private insurer role it is not possible to predict the outcome of this congressional or regulatory activity any of which could adversely affect the company anti remuneration law federal law prohibits among other thing an entity from knowingly

retain qualified and experienced employee is essential to meet our current and future goal and objective there is no guarantee we will be able to attract and retain such employee or that competition among potential employer will not result in increased salary or other benefit if we are unable to retain existing employee or attract additional employee or we experience an unexpected loss of leadership we could experience material adverse effect on our business and result of operation in addition our failure to adequately plan for succession of senior management and other key management role or the failure of key employee to successfully transition into new role could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation the succession plan we have in place and our employment arrangement with certain key executive do not guarantee the service of these executive will continue to be available to we are subject to potential change in public policy law and regulation including reform of the united state health care system that can adversely affect the market for our product and service and our business operation result of operation cash flow and prospect the political environment in which we operate remains uncertain it is reasonably possible that our business operation and result of operation could be materially adversely affected by legislative regulatory and public policy change at the federal or state level increased government involvement in drug reimbursement pricing and or purchasing increased regulation of pbms change to medicare medicaid or the regulatory environment for health care benefit including the aca change to drug reimbursement and or pricing law and regulation change to the law and regulation governing pbms pdps and or managed medicaid organization interaction with government funded health care program change to immigration policy and or many other public policy initiative for example in january hhs proposed regulation that would exclude from the current safe harbor under the federal anti kickback statute manufacturer rebate on prescription drug paid to pbms pdps and managed medicaid organization in connection with federally funded health care program it is not possible to predict whether or when any such change will occur or form any such change may take including through the use of united state presidential executive order other significant change to health care system legislation or regulation well change with respect to tax and trade policy tariff and other government regulation affecting trade between the united state and other country are also possible and could adversely affect if we fail to respond adequately to such change including by implementing strategic and operational initiative or do not do so effectively our competitor our business operation and result of operation may be materially adversely affected in addition to effort to amend repeal or replace the aca and related regulation we expect the federal and state government to continue to enact and seriously consider many broad based legislative and regulatory proposal that will or could materially impact various aspect of the health care and related benefit system and our business potential modification to the aca including change in enforcement and or funding that further destabilize the public exchange well significant change to medicaid funding could impact the number of american with health insurance and consequently prescription drug coverage further change to federal health care law including the aca drug reimbursement and pricing law and or law governing pbms pdps and or managed medicaid organization interaction with government funded health care program are probable we can not predict the effect if any that new health care legislation future change to the aca or the implementation or failure to implement the outstanding provision of aca may have on our retail pharmacy ltc pharmacy specialty pharmacy pharmacy service and or health care benefit operation and or result of operation the federal and many state government also are considering change in the interpretation enforcement and or application of existing program law and regulation including change to payment under and funding of medicare and medicaid program in addition much of the branded and generic drug product that we sell in our retail mail and specialty pharmacy and much of the other merchandise we sell is manufactured in whole or in substantial part outside of the united state in most case the product or merchandise are imported by others and sold to result significant change in tax or trade policy tariff or trade relation between the united state and other country such the imposition of unilateral tariff on imported product could result in significant increase in our cost restrict our access to supplier depress economic activity and have material page effect on our business cash flow and result of operation in addition other country may change their business and trade policy and such change well any negative sentiment towards the united state in response to increased import tariff and other change in united state trade regulation could adversely affect our business we can not predict the enactment or content of new legislation and regulation or change to existing law or regulation or their enforcement interpretation or application or the effect they will have on our business operation or result of operation which could be materially adverse even if we could predict such matter it is not possible to eliminate the adverse impact of public policy change that would fundamentally change the dynamic of one or more of the industry in which we operate example of such change include the federal or one or more state government fundamentally restructuring or reducing the funding available for medicare medicaid dual eligible or dual eligible special need plan program increasing it involvement in drug reimbursement pricing and or purchasing changing the law and regulation governing pbms pdps and or managed medicaid organization interaction with government funded health care program changing the tax treatment of health or related benefit or repealing or otherwise significantly altering the aca the likelihood of adverse change remains high due to state and federal budgetary pressure and our business and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected by such change even if we correctly predict their occurrence for more information on these matter see government regulation included in item of this annual report on form our enterprise strategy may not be an effective response to the changing dynamic in the industry in which we operate or we may not be able to implement our strategy and related strategic project our strategy includes effectively investing our capital and human resource in appropriate strategic project current operation and acquisition to transform our business in response to the changing dynamic in the industry in which we operate our strategic project include among other thing integrating the aetna acquisition significant investment in human and technology resource to expand our consumer oriented product and service optimizing our business platform managing certain significant technology project further improving relation with manufacturer supplier and health care provider negotiating contract change with customer manufacturer supplier and health care provider and implementing other business process improvement implementing our strategic initiative will require significant investment of capital and human resource among other thing we will need to simultaneously acquire and develop new personnel product and system to serve existing and new customer with existing and new product and to enhance our existing customer service information technology control and compliance process and system the future performance of our business will depend in large part on our ability to design and implement our strategic initiative some of which will occur over several year if these initiative do not achieve their objective our result of operation could be adversely affected our enterprise strategy may not be an effective response to the changing dynamic in the industry in which we operate and we may fail to recognize and position to capitalize upon market opportunity we may not have sufficient advance notice and resource to develop and effectively implement an alternative strategy if our existing competitor and or new entrant whether vertical horizontal or online digital commerce into one or more of our business create new disruptive business model and or develop new offering that customer member and or health care provider prefer to our offering we may lose customer member and or provider and our result of operation cash flow and or prospect may be adversely affected in addition our result of operation cash flow and or prospect may be adversely affected by consolidation among the participant in the industry in which we operate and or our customer base our business and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected by such change even if we correctly predict their occurrence risk related to our businessesefforts to reduce reimbursement level and alter health care financing practice could adversely affect our business the continued effort of hmo mcos pbms government entity and other third party payors to reduce prescription drug cost and pharmacy reimbursement rate well litigation and other legal proceeding relating to how drug are priced may adversely affect our profitability in particular increased utilization of generic drug which normally yield higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand named drug ha resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payment to retail specialty ltc and mail order pharmacy for generic drug causing reduction in our margin on sale of generic drug historically the effect of this trend on generic profitability ha been mitigated by the introduction of new multi source generic drug well inflation on brand name drug and by our effort to negotiate reduced acquisition cost of generic drug with manufacturer however in recent year there ha been significant consolidation within the generic manufacturing industry and in we expect fewer new multi source generic drug to be introduced and lower brand name drug inflation than in recent prior year and it is possible that these and other external factor may enhance the ability of manufacturer to sustain or increase pricing of generic drug and diminish our ability to negotiate reduced acquisition cost any inability to offset increased brand name or page prescription drug cost or to modify our activity to lessen the financial impact of such increased cost could have significant adverse effect on our result of operation in addition during the past several year the united state health care industry ha been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and audit at both the federal and state level effort to control health care cost including prescription drug cost are continuing at the federal and state government level changing political economic and regulatory influence may significantly affect health care financing and reimbursement practice for example we anticipate that federal and state government will continue to review and ass alternative health care delivery system payment methodology and operational requirement for health care provider including ltc facility and pharmacy and participant in government funded health care program change in the composition of pharmacy prescription volume toward program offering lower reimbursement rate could adversely affect our profitability any action taken to repeal or replace all or significant part of aca also could adversely affect our profitability though it is unclear at this time what the full effect of any such change would be the aca made several significant change to medicaid rebate and to reimbursement rate one of these change wa to revise the definition of the average manufacturer price pricing element common to most payment formula and the reimbursement formula for generic drug this change ha adversely affected the reimbursement we receive when we dispense prescription drug to medicaid recipient in addition the aca made other change that affect the coverage and plan design that are or will be provided by many of our health plan client including the requirement for health insurer to meet minimum mlr to avoid having to pay rebate to enrollee these aca change may not affect our business directly but they could indirectly impact our service business practice and or result of operation gross margin in the industry in which we operate may decline the pbm industry ha been experiencing margin pressure result of competitive pressure and increased client demand for lower price increased revenue sharing enhanced service offering and or higher service level in that regard we maintain contractual relationship with generic drug manufacturer and brand name drug manufacturer that provide for purchase discount and or rebate on drug dispensed by pharmacy in our retail network and by our specialty and mail order pharmacy all or portion of which may be passed on to client manufacturer rebate often depend on pbm ability to meet contractual market share or other requirement including in some case the placement of manufacturer product on the pbm formulary if we lose our relationship with one or more drug manufacturer or if the discount or rebate provided by drug manufacturer decline our business and result of operation could be adversely affected further competitive pressure in the pbm industry have resulted in our client sharing in larger portion of rebate and or discount received from drug manufacturer marketplace dynamic and regulatory change also have impacted our ability to offer plan sponsor pricing that includes the use of retail differential or spread which could adversely affect our future profitability and we expect these trend to continue further change in existing federal or state law or regulation or the adoption of new law or regulation relating to additional regulation of pbms drug pricing or purchasing patent term extension purchase discount and or rebate arrangement with drug manufacturer or additional regulation of pbms formulary management or other pbm service could also reduce the discount or rebate we receive in addition change in federal or state law or regulation or the adoption of new law or regulation relating to claim processing and billing including our ability to use mac list and collect transmission fee could adversely affect our profitability our retail pharmacy specialty pharmacy and ltc pharmacy operation also have been affected by the margin pressure described above including client demand for lower price generic pricing and network reimbursement pressure in addition competition increase in the geography in which we operate including competition from new entrant significant increase in general pricing pressure could occur and this could require to reevaluate our pricing structure to remain competitive shift in the mix of our pharmacy prescription volume towards program offering lower reimbursement rate could adversely affect our margin including the ongoing shift in pharmacy mix towards day prescription at retail and the ongoing shift in pharmacy mix towards medicare part prescription finally the margin of our ltc business are further affected by the increased effort of health care payors to negotiate reduced or capitated pricing arrangement these action could also adversely affect the margin of our ltc business our result of operation are affected by the health of the economy in general and in the geography we serve our business are affected by the united state economy and consumer confidence in general and in the geography we serve including various economic factor inflation and change in consumer purchasing power preference and or spending pattern it is possible that an unfavorable uncertain or volatile economic environment will cause decline in drug utilization an increase in health care utilization and dampen demand for pbm service well consumer demand for product sold in our retail store further economic condition including interest rate fluctuation change in capital market condition and page change may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable term our ability to secure suitable store location under acceptable term and our ability to execute sale leaseback transaction under acceptable term adverse change in the united state economy consumer confidence and economic condition could have an adverse effect on our business and financial result this adverse effect could be further exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high deductible health plan and health plan design favoring co insurance over co payment member and other consumer may decide to postpone or not to seek medical treatment which may lead them to incur more expensive medical treatment in the future and or decrease our prescription volume in addition our health care benefit membership remains concentrated in certain geographic area in the united state and in certain industry unfavorable change in health care or other benefit cost or reimbursement rate or increased competition in those geographic area where our membership is concentrated could therefore have disproportionately adverse effect on our health care benefit result of operation our health care benefit membership ha been and may continue to be affected by workforce reduction by our customer due to adverse and or uncertain general economic condition especially in the united state geography and industry where our membership is concentrated result we may not be able to profitably grow and diversify our health care benefit membership geographically by product type or by customer industry and our revenue and result of operation may be disproportionately affected by adverse change affecting our customer we operate in highly competitive business environment competitive and economic pressure may limit our ability to increase pricing to reflect higher cost or may force to accept lower margin if customer elect to self insure reduce benefit or adversely renegotiate or amend their agreement with our revenue and result of operation will be adversely affected we may not be able to obtain appropriate pricing on new or renewal business each of our business currently operates in highly competitive and evolving business environment we must compete successfully with existing competitor and new entrant including strategic alliance and online digital and commerce company the competitive success of our retail pharmacy business well our specialty pharmacy operation with third party payors is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationship with pbms and other payors on acceptable term in an environment where some pbm client are considering adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy network pharmacy retail business we compete with other drugstore chain supermarket online and other discount retailer independent pharmacy membership club convenience store and mass merchant some of which are aggressively expanding into market we serve we also face competition from other retail health care clinic well other mail order pharmacy and pbms disruptive innovation by existing or new competitor could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require to accurately identify and ass such change and make timely and effective change to our strategy and business model to compete effectively competition may also come from other source in the future change in market dynamic or the action of competitor or manufacturer including industry consolidation the emergence of new competitor and strategic alliance and decision to exclude from new narrow or restricted retail pharmacy network could materially and adversely affect our business result of operation cash flow and prospect we also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to change in market dynamic for example specialty pharmacy represents significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the united state significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacy because our specialty pharmacy operation focus on complex and high cost medication that serve relatively limited universe of patient the future growth of this business depends to significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drug and successfully penetrate key treatment category the competitive success of our ltc pharmacy operation is dependent upon our ability to compete in each geographic region where we have operation in the geographic region we serve we compete with pharmerica our largest ltc pharmacy competitor well with numerous local and regional institutional pharmacy pharmacy owned by long term care facility and local retail pharmacy our ltc pharmacy customer consist of skilled nursing facility assisted living facility independent living community hospital correctional facility and other health care service provider one of our growth opportunity is to increase our penetration rate in the assisted living segment where resident can choose which pharmacy will provide them with prescription drug the ability of resident of an assisted living facility to select the pharmacy that supply or her with prescription drug could adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation because there can be no assurance that such resident will select the competitive success of our pharmacy service business is impacted by it ability to establish and maintain contractual relationship with network pharmacy in an environment where some pbm client are considering adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy network competitor in the pbm industry the express script business of cigna corporation page prime therapeutic medimpact and humana include large national pbm company pbms owned by large national health plan and smaller standalone pbms competition also may come from other source in the future in addition change in the overall composition of our pharmacy network or reduced pharmacy access under our network could adversely affect our claim volume and or our competitiveness generally customer contract in our health care benefit segment are generally for period of one year and our customer have considerable flexibility in moving between and our competitor one of the key factor on which we compete for customer especially in uncertain economic environment is overall cost we are therefore under pressure to contain premium price increase despite being faced with increasing health care and other benefit cost and increasing operating cost if we are unable to increase our price to reflect increasing cost our profitability will be adversely affected if we are unable to limit our price increase we may lose member to competitor with more favorable pricing adversely affecting our revenue and result of operation in response to rising price our customer may elect to self insure or to reduce benefit in order to limit increase in their benefit cost alternatively our customer may purchase different type of product from that are le profitable such election may result in reduced membership in our more profitable insured product and or lower premium for our insured product which may adversely affect our revenue and result of operation although such election also may reduce our health care and other benefit cost in addition our medicare medicaid and chip product are subject to termination without cause periodic re bid rate adjustment and program redesign customer seek to contain their benefit cost particularly in an uncertain economy these action may adversely affect our membership revenue and result of operationscompetitors in each of our business may offer service and pricing term that we may not be willing or able to offer for example strong competition in the pbm marketplace ha generated greater client demand for lower pricing increased revenue sharing and enhanced product and service offering unless we can demonstrate enhanced value to our client through innovative product and service offering particularly in rapidly changing health care industry we may be unable to remain competitive we may lose client and or fail to win new business if we fail to compete effectively in the geography and product area in which we operate including maintaining or increasing membership in our health care benefit segment our result of operation financial condition and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected our pbm business generates revenue primarily by contracting with client to provide prescription drug and related health care service to plan member pbm client contract often have term of approximately three year in duration so approximately one third of pbm client base typically is subject to renewal each year in some case however pbm client may negotiate shorter or longer contract term or may require early or periodic renegotiation of pricing prior to expiration of contract our client are generally well informed and organized can move between our competitor and often seek competing bid prior to expiration of their contract in addition the reputational impact of service related incident could adversely affect our business these factor together with the impact of competitive pressure could make it difficult for to attract new client retain existing client and cross sell additional product and or service further the pbm industry ha been affected by consolidation activity that may continue in the future if one or more of our pbm client is acquired by an entity that is not also our client we may be unable to retain all or portion of the acquired client business these circumstance either individually or in the aggregate could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial result therefore we continually face challenge in competing for new pbm business and retaining or renewing our existing pbm business with respect to our ltc pharmacy business reimbursement from skilled nursing facility for prescription we dispense is determined pursuant to our agreement with those skilled nursing facility the termination of these agreement generally terminates our ability to provide service to any of the resident of that facility resulting in the loss of revenue from any source for those resident there can be no assurance that we will be able to win new business or secure renewal business on term favorable to the present term additionally with respect to our retail and ltc pharmacy business reimbursement under medicare part well reimbursement from certain private third party payors is determined pursuant to agreement that we negotiate with those payors or their pbm representative the loss of those agreement or material change in the term of those agreement could adversely affect our result of operation and cash flow in addition restricted network that exclude our retail or specialty pharmacy adversely affect those business the health care and related benefit industry is highly competitive primarily due to large number of for profit and not for profit competitor our competitor marketing and pricing and proliferation of competing product including new product that are continually being introduced into the marketplace our health care benefit segment face significant competition in all of the geography and product area in which it operates new entrant into the marketplace well consolidation within the industry have contributed to and are expected to intensify the competitive environment in addition the rapid pace of change the industry evolves towards consumer focused retail marketplace including insurance exchange and the page use of technology to interact with member provider and customer increase the risk we currently face from new entrant and disruptive action by existing competitor compared to prior period our health care benefit segment competes on the basis of many factor including perceived overall quality quality of service comprehensiveness of coverage cost including premium provider discount and member out of pocket cost product design financial stability and rating breadth and quality of provider network provider available in such network and quality of member support and care management program our health care benefit segment competitor include among others unitedhealth group incorporated anthem inc humana inc cigna corporation wellcare health plan inc centene corporation molina healthcare inc kaiser permanente health system owned health plan and new entrant into the marketplace and numerous for profit and not for profit organization operating under license from the blue cross and blue shield association the health care benefit segment largest competitor in it medicare product is original medicare additional competitor in this segment business include other type of medical and dental provider organization various specialty service provider including pbm service provider health care consultant financial service company integrated health care delivery organization network of provider who also coordinate administrative service for and assume insurance risk of their member tpas hit company and for certain plan program sponsored by the federal or state government emerging competitor include start up health care benefit plan provider owned health plan new joint venture including for profit and not for profit joint venture among firm from multiple industry technology firm financial service firm that are distributing competing product on their proprietary private exchange consulting firm that are distributing competing product on their proprietary private exchange well non traditional distributor such retail company in particular geography competitor may have greater capability resource or membership more established reputation superior supplier or health care professional pricing and contract term better business relationship or other factor that give such competitor competitive advantage the health care benefit segment competes for sale on insurance exchange and is developing and expanding it consumer health product and service product and service offering where we face additional risk from existing and new competitor including our vendor who have lower cost structure greater experience marketing to consumer and or who target the higher margin portion of our business among the health care benefit segment international and hit competitor many have longer operating history better brand recognition and greater market presence in many of the area in which the segment is seeking to expand and more experience at rapidly innovating product there can be no assurance that the aetna acquisition will not adversely affect any of our segment respective ability to attract new client or retain existing client or our ability to cross sell additional product and or service within any segment or between segment if we do not compete effectively in the geography and product area in which we operate our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected we are exposed to risk relating to the solvency of our customer and of other insurer if our customer operating and financial performance deteriorates or they are unable to make scheduled payment or obtain adequate financing our customer may not be able to pay timely or may delay payment of amount owed to any inability of our customer to pay for our product and service may adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation in addition both state and federal government sponsored payer result of budget deficit or reduction may suspend payment or seek to reduce their healthcare expenditure resulting in our customer delaying payment to or renegotiating their contract with any delay or reduction in payment by such government sponsored payer may adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation we are subject to assessment under guaranty fund law for obligation of insolvent insurance company such the discounted estimated liability expense of million pretax for our estimated share of future assessment for penn treaty network america insurance company and one of it subsidiary that aetna recorded in the first quarter of hmo aca co ops and other payors to policyholder and claimant we face risk relating to the market availability pricing supplier and safety profile of prescription drug that we purchase and sell we dispense significant volume of brand name and generic drug from our retail ltc specialty and mail order pharmacy and through our pbm network of retail pharmacy when increased safety risk profile or manufacturing or other supply issue of specific drug or class of drug occur or drug become subject to greater restriction controlled substance physician may cease writing prescription for these drug or the utilization of these drug may be otherwise reduced additionally adverse publicity regarding drug with higher safety risk profile may result in reduced consumer demand for such drug on occasion product are withdrawn by their manufacturer or transition to over the counter product which can page in lower prescription utilization in addition future fda ruling could restrict the supply or increase the cost of product sold to our customer our result of operation and cash flow may decline result of such regulatory ruling or market change further we acquire substantial amount of our mail and specialty pharmacy prescription drug supply from limited number of supplier our agreement with these supplier are often short term and easily cancelable by either party without cause in addition these agreement may limit our ability to provide service for competing drug during the term of the agreement and may allow the supplier to distribute through channel other than certain of these agreement also allow pricing and other term to be adjusted periodically for changing market condition or required service level termination or modification to any of these relationship could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation moreover many product distributed by our specialty pharmacy business are manufactured with ingredient that are susceptible to supply shortage in some case we depend upon single source of supply any such supply shortage or loss of any such single source of supply could adversely affect our result of operation and cash flow in addition our supplier are independent entity subject to their own operational and financial risk that are outside our control if our current supplier were to stop selling prescription drug to or delay delivery including result of supply shortage supplier production disruption supplier quality issue closing or bankruptcy of our supplier or for other reason we may be unable to procure alternative from other supplier in timely and efficient manner and on acceptable term or at all disruption in our business operation could occur result of contamination of drug failure to maintain necessary shipment and storage condition error in mail order processing the unavailability of prescription drug provided by supplier labor disruption or other unanticipated disruption at our mail order dispensing pharmacy facility specialty pharmacy facility call center data center or corporate facility among other factor such disruption could reduce our ability to process and dispense prescription and provide product and service to our customer if any product we distribute are in limited supply for significant period of time our financial condition and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected we face risk related to the frequency and rate of the introduction and pricing of generic drug and brand name prescription drug product the profitability of our retail ltc and pharmacy service segment is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug product utilization trend are affected by among other factor the introduction of new and successful prescription drug well lower priced generic alternative to existing brand name product because we generally earn higher gross margin on the sale of generic alternative than on brand name equivalent in addition inflation in the price of brand name drug can affect utilization particularly given the increase in high deductible health plan accordingly our business and result of operation could be adversely affected by slowdown or delay in the number or magnitude of new and successful prescription drug and or generic alternative well inflation in the price of brand name drug for example we project that the operating income of our pharmacy service and retail ltc segment may be reduced in compared to due in part to fewer new multi source generic drug being introduced and lower brand name drug price inflation in than possible change in industry pricing benchmark and drug pricing generally can adversely affect our pbm business it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulator may evaluate and or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace awp or wholesale acquisition cost wac which are the pricing reference used for many of our pbm and ltc client contract drug purchase agreement retail network contract specialty payor agreement and other contract with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payment in addition many state medicaid fee for service program ffs medicaid have established pharmacy network payment on the basis of actual acquisition cost aac the use of an aac basis in ffs medicaid could have an impact on reimbursement practice in other commercial and government product future change to the use of awp wac or to other published pricing benchmark used to establish drug pricing including change in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health program and or other payors could impact the reimbursement we receive from medicare and medicaid program the reimbursement we receive from our pbm client and other payors and or our ability to negotiate rebate and or discount with drug manufacturer wholesaler pbms and retail pharmacy failure or inability to fully offset any increased price or cost or to modify our operation to mitigate the impact of such increase could have material adverse effect on our result of operation additionally any future change in drug price could be significantly different than our projection the effect of these possible change on our business can not be predicted at this time page liability product recall or personal injury issue could damage our reputation the product that we sell could become subject to contamination product tampering mislabeling recall or other damage in addition error in the dispensing and packaging of drug and consuming drug in manner that is not prescribed could lead to serious injury or death product liability or personal injury claim may be asserted against with respect to any of the drug or other product we sell or service we provide for example we are defendant in litigation proceeding relating to opioids and the sale of product containing talc our business involve the provision of professional service including by pharmacist physician assistant nurse and nurse practitioner that expose to professional liability claim should product or other liability issue arise the coverage limit under our insurance program and the indemnification amount available to may not be adequate to protect against claim we also may not be able to maintain our existing level of insurance on acceptable term in the future damage to our reputation in the event of product liability or personal injury issue or judgment against or product recall could have significant adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation we face challenge in growing our medicare advantage and medicare part membership we are seeking to substantially grow our medicare advantage and medicare part membership revenue and result of operation in and over the next several year including by significantly expanding our medicare advantage service area the organic expansion of our medicare advantage service area is subject to the ability of cm to process our request for service area expansion and our ability to build cost competitive provider network in the expanded service area that meet applicable network adequacy requirement cm decision on our request for service area expansion also may be affected adversely by compliance issue that arise each year in our medicare operation if we are not successful in expanding our medicare advantage service area we may not be able to achieve our medicare advantage growth goal we face challenge in growing our medicaid membership and expanding our medicaid membership expose to additional risk we are seeking to substantially grow our medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special need plan membership over the next several year in many instance to acquire and retain our government customer business we must bid against our competitor in highly competitive environment winning bid often are challenged successfully by unsuccessful bidder our ability to maintain and grow membership revenue and result of operation in our medicaid product is dependent on our remaining competitive on price performance and preparing successful bid in case where successful bid is challenged we incur defense cost and may incur unreimbursed implementation and other cost to meet contractual deadline even if we ultimately lose the challenge if we are successful in expanding our medicaid membership we may increase our exposure to state that face budgetary pressure hospital and other provider that face revenue challenge associated with uncompensated care and pressure on our operating margin driven by the projected rapid growth in the size of and cost of care for the medicaid eligible population change in our health care benefit product mix may adversely affect our profit margin our insured health care benefit product that involve greater potential risk generally tend to be more profitable than our asc product historically smaller employer group have been more likely to purchase insured health care benefit product because such purchaser are generally unable or unwilling to bear greater liability for health care expenditure although recently even relatively small employer have moved to asc product we also serve government sponsored program including medicare and medicaid that are subject to competitive bid and regulatory requirement and have lower profit margin than the insured commercial product in our health care benefit segment although our health care benefit membership is projected to continue to shift towards government product in the profitability of each of those product differs and may be le than the profitability of an insured commercial product shift of enrollee from more profitable product to le profitable product could have material adverse effect on our result of operation we may not be able to accurately forecast health care and other benefit cost which could adversely affect our health care benefit segment result of operation there can be no assurance that the future health care and other benefit cost of our insured health care benefit product will not exceed our projection premium for our insured health care benefit product which comprised of our health care benefit revenue for are priced in advance based on our forecast of health care and other benefit cost during fixed premium period which is generally one year these forecast are typically developed several month before the fixed premium period begin are influenced by historical data and recent historical data in particular are dependent on our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trend and change in our member behavior and healthcare utilization pattern and require significant degree of page for example our revenue on medicare policy is based on bid submitted in june of the year before the contract year cost increase in excess of our projection can not be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premium result our profit are particularly sensitive to the accuracy of our forecast and our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trend even relatively small difference between predicted and actual health care and other benefit cost percentage of premium revenue can result in significant adverse change in our result of operation our health care and other benefit cost can be affected by external event that we can not forecast or anticipate and over which we have little or no control such emerging change in the economy and or public policy additional government mandated benefit or other regulatory change change in our member behavior and healthcare utilization pattern change in health care practice new technology increase in the cost of prescription drug influenza related health care cost which may be substantial and were higher than aetna projected in direct to consumer marketing by drug manufacturer cluster of high cost case epidemic pandemic terrorist attack or other man made disaster natural disaster or other event that materially increase utilization of medical and or other covered service including prescription drug well change in provider billing practice our health care and other benefit cost also can be affected by change in our business mix product design contract with provider medical management underwriting rating and or claim processing method and process and our medical management initiative may not deliver the reduction in utilization and or medical cost trend that we project it is particularly difficult to accurately anticipate detect price forecast manage and reserve for medical cost trend and utilization of medical and or other covered service during and following period when such utilization and or trend are below recent historical level during period of changing economic condition and employment level and for product with substantial membership growth and or turnover for example of december we held premium deficiency reserve of million for the coverage year related to our medicaid product we expect utilization to increase in when compared to if health care and other benefit cost are higher than the level reflected in our pricing or if we are not able to obtain appropriate pricing on new or renewal business our price will not reflect the risk we assume and our result of operation will be adversely affected if health care and other benefit cost are lower than we predict our price may be higher than those of our competitor which may cause to lose health care benefit membership number of factor many of which are beyond our control contribute to rising health care and other benefit cost if we are unable to satisfactorily manage our health care and other benefit cost our health care benefit segment result of operation and competitiveness will be adversely affected number of factor contribute to rising health care and other benefit cost including previously uninsured member entering the health care system change in member behavior and healthcare utilization pattern turnover in our membership additional government mandated benefit or other regulatory change change in the health status of our member the aging of the population and other changing demographic characteristic advance in medical technology increase in the number and cost of prescription drug including specialty pharmacy drug direct to consumer marketing by drug manufacturer the increasing influence of social medium on our member utilization and other behavior change in health care practice and inflation in addition government imposed limitation on medicare and medicaid reimbursement to health plan and provider have caused the private sector to bear greater share of increasing health care and other benefit cost over time and future amendment or repeal or replacement of the aca that increase the uninsured population may exacerbate this problem other factor that affect our health care and other benefit cost include change result of the aca change to the aca and other change in the regulatory environment the evolution toward consumer driven business model change in health care practice general economic condition such inflation and employment level new technology influenza related health care cost which may be substantial and were higher than aetna projected in cluster of high cost case epidemic or pandemic health care provider and member fraud and numerous other factor that are or may be beyond our control our health care benefit segment result of operation and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to appropriately manage future health care and other benefit cost through underwriting criterion product design provider network configuration negotiation of favorable provider contract and medical management program our medical cost management program may not be successful and may have smaller impact on health care and benefit cost than we expect the factor described above may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care and other benefit cost which can adversely affect our competitiveness and result of operation the reserve we hold for expected claim in our insured health care benefit product are based on estimate that involve an extensive degree of judgment and are inherently variable any reserve including premium deficiency reserve may be page if actual claim exceed our estimate our result of operation could be materially adversely affected and our ability to take timely corrective action to limit future cost may be limited large portion of health care claim are not submitted to until after the end of the quarter in which service are rendered by provider to our member our reported health care cost payable for any particular period reflect our estimate of the ultimate cost of such claim well claim that have been reported to but not yet paid we also must estimate the amount of rebate payable under the aca cm and opm minimum mlr rule and the amount payable by to and receivable by from the united state federal government under the aca remaining premium stabilization program our estimate of health care cost payable are based on number of factor including those derived from historical claim experience but this estimation process also make use of extensive judgment considerable variability is inherent in such estimate and the accuracy of the estimate is highly sensitive to change in medical claim submission and processing pattern and or procedure turnover and other change in membership change in product mix change in the utilization of medical and or other covered service including prescription drug change in medical cost trend change in our medical management practice and the introduction of new benefit and product we estimate health care cost payable periodically and any resulting adjustment including premium deficiency reserve are reflected in current period result of operation within benefit cost for example of december we held premium deficiency reserve of million for the coverage year related to our medicaid product worsening or improvement of health care cost trend rate or change in claim payment pattern from those that we assumed in estimating health care cost payable of december would cause these estimate to change in the near term and such change could be material furthermore if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trend or accurately estimate the cost of incurred but not yet reported claim or reported claim that have not been paid our ability to take timely corrective action to limit future cost and reflect our current benefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited which would further exacerbate the extent of any adverse impact on our result of operation these risk are particularly acute during and following period when utilization of medical and or other covered service and or medical cost trend are below recent historical level and in product where there is significant turnover in our membership each year and such risk are further magnified by the aca and other legislation and regulation that limit our ability to price for our projected and or experienced increase in utilization and or medical cost trend extreme event or the threat of extreme event could materially increase our health care including behavioral health cost we can not predict whether or when any such event will occur nuclear biological or other attack whether result of war or terrorism other man made disaster natural disaster epidemic pandemic and other extreme event can affect the united state economy in general our industry and specifically in particular such extreme event or the threat of such extreme event could result in significant health care including behavioral health cost which would also be affected by the government action and the responsiveness of public health agency and other insurer in addition our employee and those of our vendor are concentrated in certain large metropolitan area which may be particularly exposed to these event such event could adversely affect our business cash flow and result of operation and in the event of extreme circumstance our financial condition or viability particularly if our response to such event are le adequate than those of our competitor change in public policy and other legal and regulatory riskslegislative and regulatory change could create significant challenge to our medicare advantage and medicare part revenue and result of operation and proposed change to these program could create significant additional challenge entitlement program reform if it occurs could have material adverse effect on our business operation and or result of operation medicare advantage payment rate to health plan have been cut over the last several year with additional reduction to be phased in through cm issued the final notice in april overall we project the benchmark rate in the final notice will increase funding for our medicare advantage business excluding the impact of coding trend by approximately percent in compared to this rate increase only slightly offset the challenge we face from the impact of the increasing cost of medical care including prescription medication the hif and cm local and national coverage decision that require to pay for service and supply that are not factored into our bid and creates continued pressure on the medicare advantage program and our medicare advantage result of operation we can not predict future medicare funding level the impact of future federal budget action or ensure that such change or action will not have an adverse effect on our medicare result of operation page addition the star rating from cm for our medicare advantage plan will continue to have significant effect on our plan result of operation since only medicare advantage plan with star rating of four or higher out of five are eligible for quality bonus in their basic premium rate cm continues to change it rating system to make achieving and maintaining four or higher star rating more difficult our star rating and past performance score are adversely affected by the compliance issue that arise each year in our medicare operation if our star rating fall below for significant portion of our medicare advantage membership or do not match the performance of our competitor or the star rating quality bonus are reduced or eliminated our revenue and result of operation may be significantly adversely affected payment we receive from cm for our medicare advantage and part business also are subject to risk adjustment based on the health status of the individual we enroll element of that risk adjustment mechanism continue to be challenged by the doj the oig and cm itself substantial change in the risk adjustment mechanism including change that result from enforcement or audit action could materially affect the fairness of our medicare reimbursement require to raise price or reduce the benefit we offer to medicare beneficiary and potentially limit our and the industry participation in the medicare program medicare part ha resulted in increased utilization of prescription medication and put pressure on our pharmacy gross margin rate due to regulatory and competitive pressure further result of the aca and change to the retiree drug subsidy rule client of our pbm could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefit to their medicare eligible member to the extent this phenomenon occurs the adverse effect of increasing customer migration into medicare part may outweigh the benefit we realize from growth of our medicare part business in addition if the cost and complexity of medicare part exceed management expectation or prevent effective program implementation or administration if change to the regulation regarding how drug cost are reported for medicare part are implemented in manner that adversely affect the profitability of our medicare part business if change to the applicable regulation impact our ability to retain fee from third party including network pharmacy if the government alters medicare part program requirement or reduces funding because of the higher than anticipated cost to taxpayer of medicare part or for other reason if the government mandate the use of point of sale manufacturer rebate or up front drug pricing discount make drug manufacturer rebate illegal or make change to how pharmacy pay for performance is calculated or if reinsurance threshold are reduced below their current level our medicare part result of operation and our ability to expand our medicare part business could be adversely affected more generally our medicare result of operation and our ability to expand our medicare membership and revenue also could be adversely affected if we fail to design and maintain program that are attractive to medicare advantage or part participant if cm imposes restriction on our medicare business result of audit or other regulatory action if we fail to successfully implement corrective action or other remedial measure sufficient to prevent or remove any applicable restriction that may be imposed by cm or if we are not successful in retaining enrollee or winning contract renewal or new contract under medicare competitive bidding process federal funding for expanded medicaid coverage began to decrease in this reduction is causing state to re evaluate funding for their medicaid expansion that re evaluation may adversely affect medicaid payment rate our medicaid membership in those state our revenue our mbrs and our result of operation we may not be able to obtain adequate premium rate increase in our insured health care benefit product which would have an adverse effect on our revenue mbrs and result of operation and could magnify the adverse impact of increase in health care and other benefit cost and of aca assessment fee and tax premium rate for our insured health care benefit product generally must be filed with state insurance regulator and are subject to their approval which creates risk for in the current political and regulatory environment the aca generally requires review by hhs in conjunction with state regulator of premium rate increase that exceed federally specified threshold or lower state specific threshold set by state determined by hhs to have adequate process rate review can magnify the adverse impact on our operating margin and result of operation of increase in health care and other benefit cost increased utilization of covered service and aca assessment fee and tax by restricting our ability to reflect these increase and or these assessment fee and tax in our pricing the risk of increase in utilization of medical and or other covered service and or in health care and other benefit cost is particularly acute during and following period when utilization ha been below recent historical level during period of changing economic condition and or employment level and in product where there is significant turnover in our membership each year further our ability to reflect aca assessment fee and tax in our medicare rate is limited similarly our ability to reflect them in our medicaid and or chip premium rate is limited due among other thing to the budgetary pressure currently facing many state government this could magnify the adverse impact on our operating margin and result of operation of increase in utilization of medical and other covered service health care and other benefit cost and or medical cost trend that exceed our projection page hhs ha issued determination to health plan that their rate increase were unreasonable and we continue to experience challenge to appropriate premium rate increase in certain state regulator or legislature in number of state have implemented or are considering limit on premium rate increase either by enforcing existing legal requirement more stringently or proposing different regulatory standard regulator or legislature in number of state also have conducted hearing on proposed premium rate increase which can result in some instance have resulted in substantial delay in implementing proposed rate increase even if they ultimately are approved our plan can be excluded from participating in small group public exchange if they are deemed to have history of unreasonable rate increase we requested significant increase in our premium rate in our small group commercial health care benefit product for and expect to continue to request significant increase in those rate for and beyond in order to adequately price for projected medical cost trend required expansion of coverage and significant assessment fee and tax imposed by the federal and state government including the aca our rate also must be adequate to reflect the risk that our product will be selected by people with higher risk profile or utilization rate than the pool of participant we anticipated when we established the pricing for the applicable product also known adverse selection in our product particularly in small group product which we expect to continue and potentially worsen in following the expiration of the aca risk corridor and reinsurance program at the end of these significant rate increase heighten the risk of adverse public and regulatory reaction and adverse selection and the likelihood that our requested premium rate increase will be denied reduced or delayed which could lead to operating margin compression we anticipate continued regulatory and legislative action to increase regulation of premium rate in our insured health care benefit product we may not be able to obtain rate that are actuarially justified or that are sufficient to make our policy profitable in any product line or geography if we are unable to obtain adequate rate and or rate increase it could materially and adversely affect our operating margin and our ability to earn adequate return on insured health care benefit business in one or more state or cause to withdraw from certain geography and or product minimum mlr rebate requirement limit the level of margin we can earn in our insured health care benefit product while leaving exposed to higher than expected medical cost challenge to our minimum mlr rebate methodology and or report could adversely affect our result of operation the aca requires to pay minimum mlr rebate each year with respect to prior year the aca minimum mlr rebate requirement limit the level of margin we can earn in our commercial insured and medicare insured business cm minimum mlr rebate regulation limit the level of margin we can earn in our medicaid insured business certain portion of our health care benefit medicaid and fehb program business also are subject to minimum mlr rebate requirement in addition to but separate from those imposed by the aca minimum mlr rebate requirement leave exposed to medical cost that are higher than those reflected in our pricing the process supporting the management and determination of the amount of mlr rebate payable is complex and requires judgment and the minimum mlr reporting requirement are detailed federal and state auditor are challenging our commercial health care benefit business compliance with the aca minimum mlr requirement well our fehb plan compliance with the opm fehb program specific minimum mlr requirement our medicare and medicaid contract also are subject to minimum mlr audit if medicare advantage or medicare part

will be terminated by cm additional challenge to our methodology and or report relating to minimum mlr and related rebate by federal and state regulator and private litigant are reasonably possible the outcome of these audit and additional challenge could adversely affect our result of operation our business activity are highly regulated our pharmacy service medicare advantage medicare part medicaid dual eligible dual eligible special need plan small group and certain other product are subject to particularly extensive and complex regulation if we fail to comply with applicable law and

authority the law and regulation governing our operation and interpretation of those law and regulation are increasing in number and complexity change frequently and can be inconsistent or conflicting in general these law and regulation are designed to benefit and protect customer member and provider rather than or our investor in addition the governmental authority that regulate our business have broad latitude to make interpret and enforce the law and regulation that govern and continue to interpret and enforce those law and regulation more strictly and more aggressively each year in

litigation and regulatory risk profile are changing result of the aetna acquisition and we offer new product and service and expand in business area beyond our historical core business of retail ltc and pharmacy service historically we focused primarily on providing retail ltc and pharmacy service product and service result of the aetna acquisition we have significantly expanded our presence in health care benefit product and service including page and service offered in multiple country outside of the united state which present different litigation and regulatory risk profile than the product and service that we historically have offered the increased volume of business in area beyond our historical core business and new product and service subject to litigation and regulatory risk that are different from the risk of providing retail ltc and pharmacy service product and service and increase significantly our exposure to other risk we routinely are subject to litigation and other adverse legal proceeding including class action and qui tam action many of these proceeding seek substantial damage which may not be covered by insurance these proceeding may be costly to defend result in change in our business practice harm our brand and reputation and adversely affect our business and result of operation pharmacy service retail pharmacy ltc pharmacy and health care benefit are highly regulated and litigious industry we are currently subject to various litigation matter investigation regulatory audit inspection government inquiry and regulatory and other legal proceeding litigation and particularly security collective or class action and qui tam litigation is often expensive and disruptive certain of the lawsuit against are or are purported to be class action or qui tam action litigation related to our provision of professional service in our pharmacy specialty pharmacy medical clinic and ltc facility also ha increased we expand our service along the continuum of health care the majority of these proceeding relate to the conduct of our retail ltc pharmacy service and health care benefit operation and allege various violation of law in addition we operate in jurisdiction outside the united state where contractual right tax position and applicable regulation may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to greater degree than in the united state and are therefore more likely to be subject to dispute by customer member governmental authority and others we are incurring expense to resolve these proceeding the outcome of litigation and other adverse legal proceeding is always uncertain and outcome that are not justifiable by the evidence or existing law or regulation can and do occur litigation ha been and may be brought against by private individual on behalf of the government through qui tam or whistleblower suit under the provision of the federal and various state false claim act private citizen may bring lawsuit alleging that violation of the federal anti kickback statute or similar law ha resulted in the submission of false claim to federal and or state health care program including medicare and medicaid and we are defendant in number of such proceeding when private individual brings whistleblower suit the defendant often will not be made aware of the suit for many month or even year until the government commences it own investigation or determines whether it will intervene whistleblower suit have resulted in significant settlement between governmental agency and health care company the significant incentive and protection provided under the financial reform act increase the risk of whistleblower suit many of the legal proceeding against seek substantial damage including non economic or punitive damage and treble damage and certain of these proceeding also seek change in our business practice while we currently have insurance coverage for some potential liability other potential liability may not be covered by insurance insurer may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damage awarded or cost incurred in addition some type of damage like punitive damage may not be covered by insurance and in some jurisdiction the coverage of punitive damage is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some form of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future we can not predict the outcome of any of these matter and the cost incurred may be substantial regardless of outcome litigation and other adverse legal proceeding could materially adversely affect our business or result of operation because of brand and reputational harm to caused by such proceeding the cost of defending such proceeding the cost of settlement or judgment against or the change in our operation that could result from such proceeding see item of this annual report on form for additional information we frequently are subject to regular and special governmental audit investigation and review that could result in change to our business practice and also could result in material refund fine penalty civil liability criminal liability and other sanction one of the largest national retail and ltc pharmacy pharmacy service and health care benefit provider we frequently are subject to regular and special governmental market conduct and other audit investigation and review by and we receive subpoena and other request for information from various federal and state agency regulatory authority attorney general committee subcommittee and member of the united state congress and other state federal and international governmental authority for example we have received cid from and provided document and information to the civil division of the page in cooperation with current investigation of our patient chart review process in connection with risk adjustment data submission under part and of the medicare program several such audit investigation and review currently are pending some of which may be resolved in and the result of which may be adverse to federal and state government have made investigating and prosecuting health care and other insurance fraud waste and abuse priority fraud waste and abuse prohibition encompass wide range of activity including kickback for referral of member billing for unnecessary medical and or other covered service improper marketing and violation of patient privacy right the regulation and contractual requirement applicable to and other industry participant are complex and subject to change making it necessary for to invest significant resource in complying with our regulatory and contractual requirement ongoing vigorous law enforcement and the highly technical regulatory scheme mean that our compliance effort in this area will continue to require significant resource in addition our medical cost and the medical expense of our health care benefit asc customer may be adversely affected if we do not prevent or detect fraudulent activity by provider and or member regular and special governmental audit investigation and review by federal state and international regulator could result in change to our business practice and also could result in significant or material premium refund fine penalty civil liability criminal liability or other sanction including suspension or exclusion from participation in government program and suspension or loss of licensure any of these audit investigation or review could have material adverse effect on our financial condition result of operation or business or result in significant liability and negative publicity for our company for example since cm ha selected certain of the company medicare advantage contract for various year for radv audit in addition federal and state auditor are challenging our commercial health care benefit business compliance with the aca minimum mlr requirement well our fehb plan compliance with opm fehb program specific minimum mlr requirement our medicare and medicaid contract also are subject to minimum mlr audit if medicare advantage or medicare part contract pay minimum mlr rebate for three consecutive year it will become ineligible to enroll new member if medicare advantage or medicare part contract pay such rebate for five consecutive year it will be terminated by cm we are subject to retroactive adjustment to and or withholding of certain premium and fee including result of cm radv audit we generally rely on health care provider to appropriately code claim submission and document their medical record if these record do not appropriately support our risk adjusted premium we may be required to refund premium payment to cm and or pay fine and penalty under the false claim act premium and or fee for medicare member certain federal government employee group and medicaid beneficiary are subject to retroactive adjustment and or withholding by the federal and applicable state government our business that is subject to the aca including amount payable to or payable by under the aca premium stabilization program and our risk adjustment and reinsurance data also is subject to audit by governmental authority cm regularly audit our performance to determine our compliance with cm regulation and our contract with cm and to ass the quality of the service we provide to our medicare member cm us various payment mechanism to allocate and adjust premium payment to our and other company medicare plan by considering the applicable health status of medicare member supported by information prepared maintained and provided by health care provider we collect claim and encounter data from provider and generally rely on provider to appropriately code their submission to and document their medical record including the diagnosis data submitted to with claim cm pay increased premium to medicare advantage plan and pdps for member who have certain medical condition identified with specific diagnosis code federal regulator review and audit the provider medical record to determine whether those record support the related diagnosis code that determine the member health status and the resulting risk adjusted premium payment to in that regard cm ha instituted radv audit of subset of medicare advantage plan for various contract year including certain of our plan for various contract year to validate coding practice and supporting medical record documentation maintained by health care provider and the resulting risk adjusted premium payment to the plan cm may require to refund premium payment if our risk adjusted premium are not properly supported by medical record data the oig also is auditing our risk adjustment data and that of other company and we expect cm and the oig to continue auditing risk adjustment data we also have received cid from and provided document and information to the civil division of the doj in connection with current investigation of our patient chart review process in connection with risk adjustment data submission under part and of the medicare program in cm revised it audit methodology for radv audit to determine refund payable by medicare advantage plan for contract year and forward under the revised methodology among other thing cm will project the error rate identified page the audit sample of approximately member to all risk adjusted premium payment made under the contract being audited for contract year prior to cm not project sample error rate to the entire contract result the revised methodology may increase our exposure to premium refund to cm based on incomplete medical record maintained by provider on october cm issued proposed rule related to among other thing change to the radv audit methodology established by cm in cm project that the change to the radv audit methodology would increase it recovery from medicare advantage plan result of radv audit cm ha requested comment on the proposed rule including whether the proposed radv rule change should apply retroactively to audit of medicare advantage plan for contract year and forward we are evaluating the potential adverse effect which could be material on our result of operation financial condition and cash flow if the proposed radv rule change were adopted proposed cm also ha announced it intent to use third party auditor to attain it ultimate goal of subjecting all medicare advantage contract to either comprehensive or targeted radv audit for each contract year we are currently unable to predict which of our medicare advantage contract will be selected for future audit the amount of any retroactive refund of or prospective adjustment to medicare advantage premium payment made to the effect of any such refund or adjustment on the actuarial soundness of our medicare advantage bid or whether any radv audit finding would require to change our method of estimating future premium revenue in future bid submission to cm or compromise premium assumption made in our bid for prior contract year the current contract year or future contract year if we fail to report and correct error discovered through our own auditing procedure or during cm audit or otherwise fail to comply with the applicable law and regulation we could be subject to fine civil monetary penalty or other sanction including fine and penalty under the false claim act which could have material adverse effect on our ability to participate in medicare advantage part or other government program and on our financial condition cash flow and result of operation cm ha issued final rule implementing aca requirement that medicare advantage and pdp plan report and refund to cm overpayment that those plan receive from cm however cm statement in formalized guidance regarding overpayment to medicare advantage plan appear to be inconsistent with cm prior radv audit guidance these statement appear to equate each medicare advantage risk adjustment data error with an overpayment without reconciliation to the principle underlying the fee for service adjustment comparison contemplated by cm radv audit methodology the precise interpretation impact and legality of the final rule are not clear and are subject to pending litigation if medicare advantage plan were not paid based on payment model principle that align with the requirement of the social security act or such payment were not implemented correctly it could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and or cash flow certain of our medicaid contract require the submission of complete and correct encounter data the accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is increasingly important to the success of our medicaid program because more state are using encounter data to determine compliance with performance standard and in part to set premium rate we have expended and may continue to expend additional effort and incur significant additional cost to collect accurate or to correct inaccurate or incomplete encounter data and have been and could be exposed to premium withholding operating sanction and financial fine and penalty for noncompliance we have experienced challenge in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data due to difficulty with provider and third party vendor submitting claim in timely fashion in the proper format and with state agency in coordinating such submission state increase their reliance on encounter data these difficulty could affect the medicaid premium rate we receive and how medicaid membership is assigned to which could have material adverse effect on our medicaid result of operation and cash flow and or our ability to bid for and continue to participate in certain medicaid program any premium or fee refund adjustment or withholding or civil or criminal fine or penalty or other sanction including restriction on or change in the way we do business loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government program resulting from regulatory audit or investigation whether result of radv public exchange related recovery audit program or other audit or investigation by cm the oig hhs the doj or otherwise including audit of our minimum mlr rebate methodology and or report could be material and could adversely affect our result of operation financial condition and cash flow program funded in whole or in part by the federal government account for significant portion of our revenue the federal government and our other government customer may reduce funding for health care or other program cancel or decline to renew contract with or make change that adversely affect the number of person eligible for certain program the service provided to enrollee in such program our premium and our administrative and health care and other benefit cost any of which could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and cash flow in addition an extended federal government shutdown or delay by congress in raising the federal government debt ceiling could lead to delay reduction suspension or cancellation of federal government spending and page increase in interest rate that could in turn have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and cash flow program funded in whole or in part by the united state federal government account for significant portion of our revenue and we expect that percentage to increase our government funded business grow our exposure to change in federal and state government policy with respect to and or regulation of the various government funded program in which we participate also increase our revenue from government funded program including our medicare medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special need plan business and our government customer in our commercial business are dependent on annual funding by the federal government and or applicable state or local government federal state and local government have the right to cancel or not to renew their contract with on short notice without cause or if fund are not available funding for these program is dependent on many factor outside our control including general economic condition continuing government effort to contain health care cost and budgetary constraint at the federal or applicable state or local level and general political issue and priority for example cm is transitioning the process of calculating medicare member risk score from using diagnosis data from the risk adjustment processing system or rap to using diagnosis data from the encounter data system or ed the rap process requires medicare advantage plan to apply filter logic based on cm guideline and only submit claim that satisfy those guideline for submission through ed cm requires medicare advantage plan to submit all encounter data and cm applies the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk score for of the risk score will be calculated from claim data submitted through ed up from in for the ed percentage will increase to the transition from rap to ed could result in different risk score from each dataset result of plan processing issue cm processing issue or filtering logic difference between rap and ed and could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and or cash flow in addition while the aca provided substantial federal funding for the expansion of the number of people who qualify to enroll in medicaid beginning in that funding began to decrease in and the future of that funding is uncertain result in state are preparing for the adverse impact on their budget and program by seeking to reduce their medicaid expenditure and or changing the design of their medicaid program these change could have material adverse effect on the revenue medical benefit ratio and result operation of our medicaid contract and or our ability to grow our medicaid membership revenue and result of operation our government customer also determine the eligibility criterion premium level and other aspect of medicare medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special need plan program that affect the number of person enrolled in these program the service provided to enrollee under these program the condition for participating in these program and our administrative and health care and other benefit cost under these program for example state may require participation on their public exchange condition to participating in their medicaid or state employee health benefit program and or take program design action that shift provider cost from state employee plan to commercial and medicare plan in the past determination of this type have at time adversely affected our result of operation from and willingness to participate in such program and they may do so in the future if government customer reduces premium level or increase premium by le than the increase in our cost such by not allowing to recover aca and other applicable fee tax and assessment and we can not offset the adverse impact of these action with supplemental premium and or change in benefit plan our business and result of operation could be adversely affected in addition if state allow certain program to expire reduce the number of firm with which they contract for managed medicaid service or choose to opt out of medicaid expansion we could experience reduced medicaid enrollment or reduced medicaid enrollment growth which would adversely affect our business revenue and result of operation the federal government debt ceiling or the amount of debt the federal government is permitted to borrow to meet it legal obligation including among other thing interest on the national debt medicare and medicaid premium and contribution to the fehb program is limited by statute and can only be raised by an act of congress during federal government shutdown or if congress doe not raise the debt ceiling before the federal government current obligation approach or exceed it cash on hand and incoming receipt federal government spending may be subject to delay reduction suspension or cancellation which may be prolonged over of our health care benefit segment revenue are derived from health care coverage program that are funded in whole or in part by the federal government including the medicare medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special need plan program chip and the fehb program when federal spending is delayed suspended or curtailed we continue to receive claim from provider providing service to beneficiary of these program and we remain liable for and are required to fund such claim federal government shutdown or failure to page raise the debt ceiling could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation cash flow brand and reputation and in the case of prolonged shutdown or failure to raise the debt ceiling our financial condition if the united state default on it obligation due to failure to timely raise the debt ceiling or otherwise or it credit rating is downgraded by any of the credit rating agency interest rate could rise financial market could become volatile and or the availability of credit and short term credit in particular could be adversely affected thereby increasing our borrowing cost adversely affecting the value of our investment portfolio and or adversely affecting our ability to access the capital market which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and cash flow and could adversely affect our liquidity our result of operation may be adversely affected by change in law and policy governing employer and by union organizing activity the federal and certain state legislature continue to consider and pas legislation that increase our cost of doing business including increased minimum wage and requiring employer to provide paid sick leave in addition our employee related operating cost may be increased by union organizing activity if we are unable to reflect these increased expense in our pricing or otherwise modify our operation to mitigate the effect of such increase our result of operation will be adversely affected risk related to customer perception of our product and serviceswe must develop and maintain relevant omni channel experience for our retail customer our business ha evolved from retail store experience to interaction with customer across numerous channel including in store online mobile and social medium among others omni channel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectation and new development by our competitor our customer are increasingly using mobile phone tablet computer and other device to comparison shop determine product availability and complete purchase through mobile commerce application result the portion of total consumer expenditure with all retailer occurring online and through mobile commerce application is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate we must compete by offering consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customer regardless of the ultimate sale channel and by investing in providing and maintaining mobile commerce application for our customer that have the right feature and are reliable and easy to use if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant customer facing technology in timely manner that keep pace with technological development and dynamic customer expectation our ability to compete and our result of operation could be materially and adversely affected in addition if our online activity or our other customer facing technology system do not function designed we may experience loss of customer confidence data security breach lost sale or be exposed to fraudulent purchase any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operation reputation and result of operation we must maintain and improve our relationship with our retail and specialty pharmacy customer and increase the demand for our product and service including proprietary brand if we fail to develop new product differentiate our product from those of our competitor or demonstrate the value of our product to our customer and member our ability to retain or grow our customer base may be adversely affected the success of our business depends in part on customer loyalty superior customer service and our ability to persuade customer to frequent our retail store and online site and to purchase product in additional category and our proprietary brand failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preference and spending pattern and evolving demographic mix in our market an inability to expand the product being purchased by our client and customer or the failure or inability to obtain or offer particular category of product could adversely affect our relationship with our customer and client and the demand for our product and service and could result in excess inventory of product we offer our retail customer proprietary brand product that are available exclusively at our retail store and through our online retail site the sale of proprietary product subject to unique risk including potential product liability risk mandatory or voluntary product recall potential supply chain and distribution chain disruption for raw material and finished product our ability to successfully protect our intellectual property right and the right of applicable third party and other risk generally encountered by entity that source market and sell private label product any failure to adequately address some or all of these risk could have an adverse effect on our retail business result of operation and financial condition additionally an increase in the sale of our proprietary brand may adversely affect our sale of product owned by our supplier which consequently could adversely impact certain of our supplier relationship our ability to locate qualified economically stable supplier who satisfy our requirement and to acquire sufficient product in timely and effective manner page critical to ensuring among other thing that customer confidence is not diminished any failure to develop sourcing relationship with broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our financial performance and erode customer loyalty our specialty pharmacy business focus on complex and high cost medication many of which are made available by manufacturer to limited number of pharmacy so called limited distribution drug that serve relatively limited universe of patient result the future growth of our specialty pharmacy business is dependent largely upon expanding our base of drug or penetration in certain treatment category any contraction of our base of patient or reduction in demand for the prescription we currently dispense could have an adverse effect on our specialty pharmacy business result of operation and cash flow we operate in rapidly evolving industry our customer generally and our larger customer in particular are well informed and organized and along with our individual customer can easily move between and our competitor these factor require to differentiate our product and solution anticipate change in customer and consumer preference anticipate and effectively compete with the product and solution of new and existing competitor and innovate and deliver new and existing product and solution that demonstrate value to our customer and member particularly in response to marketplace change from public policy any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to retain or grow customer and or profitable medical membership which can adversely affect our result of operation in order to be competitive in the increasingly consumer oriented marketplace for our health care product and service we will need to develop and deploy consumer friendly product and service and make investment in consumer engagement reduce our cost structure and compete successfully with new entrant into our business if we are unsuccessful our future growth and profitability may be adversely affected historically employer have been the most significant customer driving purchase of our pharmacy service and health care benefit segment however decision to buy our pharmacy service and health care benefit product and service increasingly are made or influenced by consumer either through direct purchasing for example medicare advantage plan and pdps or through insurance exchange that allow individual choice similarly consumer increasingly seek to access health care product and service locally and through other direct channel such mobile device and our website in response to this demand we are expanding our consumer focus to compete effectively in the consumer driven marketplace we will be required to develop or acquire new capability attract new talent and develop new service and distribution relationship that respond to consumer need and preference we also will have to respond to pricing and other action taken by existing competitor well potentially disruptive new entrant regulatory and participation requirement for insurance exchange based plan tend to emphasize price and make competitive differentiation of our health care benefit product and service based on other attribute more difficult price competition from existing and potentially new disruptive competitor in the industry in which each of our segment compete also continues to increase accordingly we face competitive pricing pressure from existing and new competitor including our vendor and others who may have lower cost structure than we do and these pressure may reduce our operating margin or limit sale of our product and service our competitor may bring their consumer oriented product and service to market more quickly have greater experience marketing to consumer and or may be targeting the higher margin portion of our business these risk may be enhanced if employer shift to defined contribution health care benefit plan and make greater utilization of private exchange or encourage their employee to purchase health insurance on the public exchange we can provide no assurance that we will be able to develop or operate successful or profitable consumer oriented product and service or that our health care benefit segment will be able to compete successfully or profitably on public exchange or private exchange or benefit from any opportunity presented by public exchange or private exchange or that we will be able to benefit from opportunity available to any of our segment in the industry in which we operate if we do not develop and expand competitive and profitable consumer product are not competitive in the industry in which we operate or are unsuccessful in reducing our cost structure our future growth and profitability may be adversely affected risk related to our relationship with manufacturer provider supplier and vendorsour result of operation may be adversely affected if we are unable to contract with manufacturer provider supplier and vendor on competitive term and develop and maintain attractive network with high quality provider our pbm business generates revenue primarily by contracting with client to provide prescription drug and related health care service to plan member result we are dependent on our relationship with prescription drug manufacturer and supplier we acquire substantial amount of our mail order and specialty pharmacy prescription drug supply from limited number of supplier our agreement with these supplier often are short term and easily cancelable by either party without cause in addition these agreement may limit our ability to provide service for competing drug during the term of the page and may allow the supplier to distribute through channel other than the company termination or modification to any of these relationship could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation we are seeking to enhance our health care provider network by entering into joint venture and other collaborative risk sharing arrangement with health care provider provider willingness to enter these arrangement with depends upon among other thing our ability to provide them with up to date quality of care data to support these value based contract these arrangement are designed to give provider incentive to engage in population health management and optimize delivery of health care to our member these arrangement also may allow to expand into new geography target new customer group increase membership and reduce medical cost and if we provide technology or other service to the relevant health system or provider organization may contribute to our revenue and earnings from alternative source if such arrangement do not result in the lower medical cost that we project or if we fail to attract health care provider to such arrangement or are le successful at implementing such arrangement than our competitor our medical cost may not be competitive and may be higher than we project our attractiveness to customer may be reduced we may lose or be unable to grow membership and our ability to profitably grow our business and or our result of operation may be adversely affected while we believe joint venture acos and other non traditional health care provider organizational structure present opportunity for the implementation of our joint venture and other non traditional structure strategy may not achieve the intended result which could adversely affect our result of operation and cash flow among other thing joint venture require to maintain collaborative relationship with our counterparties continue to gain access to provider rate that make the joint venture economically sustainable and devote significant management time to the operation and management of the joint venture we may not be able to achieve these objective in one or more of our joint venture which could adversely affect our result of operation and cash flow if our service provider fail to meet their contractual obligation to or to comply with applicable law or regulation we may be exposed to brand and reputational harm litigation or regulatory action this risk is particularly high in our medicare medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special need plan program we contract with various third party to perform certain function and service and provide with certain information technology system our arrangement with these third party may expose to public scrutiny adversely affect our brand and reputation expose to litigation or regulatory action and otherwise make our operation vulnerable if we fail to adequately oversee monitor and regulate their performance or if they fail to meet their contractual obligation to or to comply with applicable law or regulation for example certain of our vendor have been responsible for release of sensitive information of our member and employee which ha caused to incur additional expense and given rise to litigation against these risk are particularly high in our medicare medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special need plan program where third party perform pbm medical management and other member related service for any failure of our or these third party prevention detection or control system related to regulatory compliance compliance with our internal policy data security and or cybersecurity or any incident involving the theft misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of or access to member customer or other constituent sensitive information could require to expend significant resource to remediate any damage interrupt our operation and adversely affect our brand and reputation and also expose to whistleblower class action and other litigation other proceeding prohibition on marketing or active or passive enrollment of member corrective action fine sanction and or penalty any of which could adversely affect our business cash flow result of operation and or financial condition continuing consolidation and integration among provider and other supplier may increase our medical and other covered benefit cost make it difficult for to compete in certain geography and create new competitor hospital and other provider and health system continue to consolidate across the health care industry while this consolidation could increase efficiency and ha the potential to improve the delivery of health care service it also reduces competition and the number of potential contracting party in certain geography these health system also are increasingly forming and considering forming health plan to directly offer health insurance in competition with process that ha been accelerated by the aca in addition acos including commercial and medicaid only acos developed result of state medicaid law practice management company consolidation among and by integrated health system and other change in the organizational structure that physician hospital and other health care provider adopt continues to change the way these provider interact with and the competitive landscape in which we operate these change may increase our medical and other covered benefit cost may affect the way we price our product and service and estimate our medical and other covered benefit cost and may require to change our operation including by withdrawing from certain geography where we do not have significant presence across our business or are unable to collaborate or contract with provider on acceptable term each of these change may adversely affect our business and result of operation page may experience increased medical and other benefit cost litigation risk and customer and member dissatisfaction when provider that do not have contract with render service to our health care benefit member some provider that render service to our health care benefit member do not have contract with in those case we do not have pre established understanding with these provider to the amount of compensation that is due to them for service rendered to our member in some state the amount of compensation due to these nonparticipating provider is defined by law or regulation but in most instance it is either not defined or it is established by standard that is not clearly translatable into dollar term in such instance provider may believe that they are underpaid for their service and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with or try to recover the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged from our member which may result in customer and member dissatisfaction for example on october an arbitrator awarded certain claimant hospital approximately million in proceeding relating to aetna out of network benefit payment and administration practice such dispute may cause to pay higher medical or other benefit cost than we projected risk related to our operationscustomers particularly large sophisticated customer expect to implement their contract and onboard their employee and member efficiently and effectively failure to do so could adversely affect our reputation business result of operation cash flow and prospect if we or our vendor fail to provide our customer with quality service that meet their expectation our ability to retain and grow our membership and customer base will be adversely affected our ability to attract and retain customer and member is dependent upon providing cost effective quality customer service operation such call center operation pbm function retail pharmacy and ltc service home delivery pharmacy prescription delivery specialty pharmacy prescription delivery claim processing customer case installation and online access and tool that meet or exceed our customer and member expectation we seek to reduce general and administrative expense we must balance the potential impact of cost saving measure on our customer and other service and performance if we misjudge the effect of such measure customer and other service may be adversely affected we depend on third party for certain of our customer service pbm and prescription delivery operation if we or our vendor fail to provide service that meet our customer and member expectation we may have difficulty retaining or profitable growing our customer base and or membership which can adversely affect our result of operation for example noncompliance with any privacy or security law or regulation or any security breach involving one of our third party vendor could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation brand and reputation we are subject to payment related risk that could increase our operating cost expose to fraud or theft subject to potential liability and disrupt our business operation we accept payment using variety of method including cash check credit card debit card gift card mobile payment and potentially other technology in the future acceptance of these payment method subject to rule regulation contractual obligation and compliance requirement including payment network rule and operating guideline data security standard and certification requirement and rule governing electronic fund transfer these requirement may change in the future which could make compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment option including credit and debit card we pay interchange and other fee which could increase periodically thereby raising our operating cost we rely on third party to provide payment processing service including the processing of credit card debit card and various other form of electronic payment if these vendor are unable to provide these service to or if their system are compromised our operation could be disrupted the payment method that we offer also expose to potential fraud and theft by person seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weakness in the payment system we use if we fail to abide by applicable rule or requirement or if data relating to our payment system is compromised due to breach or misuse we may be responsible for any cost incurred by payment card issuing bank and other third party or subject to fine and higher transaction fee in addition our reputation and ability to accept certain type of payment could each be harmed resulting in reduced sale and adverse effect on our result of operation our and our vendor operation are subject to variety of business continuity hazard and risk any of which could interrupt our operation or otherwise adversely affect our performance and result of operation we and our vendor are subject to business continuity hazard and other risk including natural disaster utility and other mechanical failure act of war or terrorism disruption of communication data security and preservation disruption of supply or distribution safety regulation and labor difficulty the occurrence of any of these or other event to the company or our vendor might disrupt or shut our operation or otherwise adversely affect our operation we may also be subject to certain liability claim in the event of an injury or loss of life or damage to property resulting from such event although we page developed procedure for crisis management and disaster recovery and business continuity plan and maintain insurance policy that we believe are customary and adequate for our size and industry our insurance policy include limit and such our coverage may be insufficient to protect against all potential hazard and risk incident to our business in addition our crisis management and disaster recovery procedure and business continuity plan may not be effective should any such hazard or risk occur or should our insurance coverage be inadequate or unavailable our business financial condition and result of operation could be adversely affected we and our vendor have experienced cyber attack we can provide no assurance that we or our vendor will be able to detect prevent or contain the effect of such attack or other information security including cybersecurity risk or threat in the future we and our vendor have experienced and continue to experience variety of cyber attack and we and our vendor expect to continue to experience cyber attack going forward among other thing we and our vendor have experienced automated attempt to gain access to our public facing network brute force syn flood and distributed denial of service attack attempted malware infection vulnerability scanning ransomware attack spear phishing campaign mass reconnaissance attempt injection attempt phishing php injection and cross site scripting we also have seen an increase in attack designed to obtain access to consumer account using illegally obtained demographic information although the impact of such attack ha not been material to our operation or result of operation through december we can provide no assurance that we or our vendor will be able to detect prevent or contain the effect of such attack or other information security including cybersecurity risk or threat in the future we expand our consumer oriented product and service increase the amount and type of data we acquire generate and use increase the amount of information we make available to member consumer and provider on mobile device expand our use of vendor expand internationally and expand our use of social medium our exposure to these data security and related cybersecurity risk including the risk of undetected attack damage loss or unauthorized disclosure or access to and or disruption of our system and the customer member provider employee aco joint venture vendor and other third party information they contain increase and the cost of attempting to protect against these risk also increase although we deploy layered approach to address information security including cybersecurity threat and vulnerability that is designed to protect confidential information against data security breach compromise of our information security control or of those business with whom we interact which result in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper person could harm our reputation and expose to regulatory action and claim from customer and client financial institution payment card association and other person any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation because the technique used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage system change frequently and may not immediately produce sign of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these technique or to implement adequate preventative measure moreover data security breach could require that we expend significant resource related to our information system and infrastructure and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duty we also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the system of third party we interact with including key payors and vendor the cost of attempting to protect against the foregoing risk and the cost of responding to cyber incident are significant large scale data breach at other entity increase the challenge we and our vendor face in maintaining the security of our information technology system and proprietary information and of our member and customer sensitive information following cyber incident our and or our vendor remediation effort may not be successful and cyber incident could result in interruption delay or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customer and member in addition breach of our and or our vendor security measure and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary information or confidential information about our customer our member or other third party could expose our customer and member private information and our customer and member to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose or other third party to risk of loss or misuse of this information and result in investigation regulatory enforcement action material fine and penalty loss of customer litigation or other action which could have material adverse effect on our business brand reputation cash flow and result of operation the failure or disruption of our information technology system or the failure of our information technology infrastructure to support our business could adversely affect our reputation business result of operation and cash flow our information system are subject to damage or interruption from power outage facility damage computer and telecommunication failure computer virus security breach including credit card or personally identifiable information breach cyber attack vandalism catastrophic event and human error if our information system are damaged fail to work properly or otherwise become unavailable or if we are unable to successfully complete our planned consolidation of our pbm page adjudication platform we may incur substantial cost to repair or replace them and may experience reputational damage loss of critical information customer disruption and interruption or delay in our ability to perform essential function and implement new and innovative service in addition compliance with change in united state and foreign privacy and information security law and standard may result in considerable expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational process our business success and result of operation depend in part on effective information technology system and on continuing to develop and implement improvement in technology pursuing multiple initiative simultaneously could make this continued development and implementation significantly more challenging many aspect of our operation are dependent on our information system and the information collected processed stored and handled by these system we rely heavily on our computer system to manage our ordering pricing point of sale pharmacy fulfillment inventory replenishment claim processing extracare customer loyalty program finance and other process throughout our operation we receive retain and transmit certain confidential information including pii and phi that our customer and client provide to purchase product or service enroll in program or service register on our website interact with our personnel or otherwise communicate with in addition for these operation we depend in part on the secure transmission of confidential information over public network we have many different information and other technology system supporting our business including result of our acquisition our business depend in large part on these system to adequately price our product and service accurately establish reserve process claim and report result of operation and interact with provider employer plan sponsor member and vendor in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion in addition recent trend toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technology including more sophisticated application for mobile device certain of our technology system including software are older legacy system that are le flexible le efficient and require significant ongoing commitment of capital and human resource to maintain protect and enhance them and to integrate them with our other system we must re engineer and reduce the number of these system to meet changing consumer and vendor preference and need improve our productivity and reduce our operating expense we also need to develop or acquire new technology system contract with new vendor or modify certain of our existing system to support the consumer oriented product and service we are developing operating and expanding and or to meet current and developing industry and regulatory standard including to keep pace with continuing change in information processing technology and emerging cybersecurity risk and threat if we fail to achieve these objective our ability to profitably grow our business and or our result of operation may be adversely affected our business strategy involves providing customer with differentiated easy to use secure product and solution that use information to meet customer need the type of technology and level of service that are acceptable to customer and member today will not necessarily be acceptable in the future requiring to anticipate and meet marketplace demand for technology our success therefore is dependent in large part on our ability within the context of limited budget of human resource and capital and our existing and future business relationship to timely secure integrate develop redesign and enhance our or contract with vendor to provide technology system that support our business strategy initiative and process in compliant secure and cost and resource efficient manner integration of our acquisition increase these challenge and we may not be successful in integrating various system in timely or cost effective manner information technology project frequently are long term in nature and may take longer to complete and cost more than we expect and may not deliver the benefit we project they are complete if we do not effectively and efficiently secure manage integrate and enhance our technology portfolio including vendor sourced system we could among other thing have problem determining health care and other benefit cost estimate and or establishing appropriate pricing meeting the need of customer provider and member developing and expanding our consumer oriented product and service or keeping pace with industry and regulatory standard and our result of operation may be adversely affected sale of our product and service are dependent on our ability to attract and motivate internal sale personnel and independent third party broker consultant and agent new distribution channel create new disintermediation risk we may be subject to penalty or other regulatory action result of the marketing practice of broker and agent selling our product our product are sold primarily through our sale personnel who frequently work with independent broker consultant and agent who assist in the production and servicing of business the independent broker consultant and agent generally are not dedicated to exclusively and may frequently recommend and or market health care benefit product of our competitor accordingly we must compete intensely for their service and allegiance our sale could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract retain or motivate sale personnel and third party broker consultant and agent or if we do not adequately page support training and education to this sale network regarding our complex product portfolio or if our sale strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channel this risk is heightened we develop operate and expand our consumer health product and service product and service and our business model evolves to include greater focus on consumer and direct to consumer sale such competing for sale on insurance exchange new distribution channel for our product and service continue to emerge including private exchange operated by health care consultant and technology company these channel may make it more difficult for to directly engage consumer and other customer in the selection and management of their health care benefit in health care utilization and in the effective navigation of the health care system we also may be challenged by new technology and marketplace entrant that could interfere with our existing relationship with customer and health plan member in these area in addition there have been number of investigation regarding the marketing practice of broker and agent selling health care and other insurance product and the payment they receive these investigation have resulted in enforcement action against company in our industry and broker and agent marketing and selling those company product for example cm and state department of insurance have increased their scrutiny of the marketing practice of broker and agent who market medicare product these investigation and enforcement action could result in penalty and the imposition of corrective action plan and or change to industry practice which could adversely affect our ability to market our product we also face other risk that could adversely affect our business result of operation financial condition and or cash flow which include failure of our corporate governance policy or procedure for example significant financial decision being made at an inappropriate level in our organization inappropriate application of accounting principle or significant failure of internal control over financial reporting which could lead to restatement of our result of operation and or deterioration in the soundness and accuracy of our reported result of operation and failure to adequately manage our run business and or our regulatory and financial exposure to business we have sold

unit goodwill and indefinitely lived intangible asset are subject to annual impairment review or more frequent review if event or circumstance indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when evaluating goodwill for potential impairment we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to their respective carrying amount we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit using combination of discounted cash flow method and market multiple method if the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds it estimated fair value goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the

downgrade in our rating could adversely affect our business cash flow financial condition and result of operation adverse condition in the and global capital market can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investment in debt and equity security mortgage loan alternative investment and other investment our result of operation and or our financial condition the global capital market including credit market continue to experience volatility and uncertainty an insurer we have substantial investment portfolio that support our policy liability and surplus and is comprised largely of debt security of issuer located in the united state result the income we earn from our investment portfolio is largely driven by the level of interest rate in the united state and to lesser extent the international financial market and volatility uncertainty and or disruption in the global capital market particularly the united state credit market and government monetary policy particularly united state monetary policy can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio our result of operation and or our financial condition by significantly reducing the value and or liquidity of the debt security we hold in our investment portfolio and creating realized capital loss that reduce our result of operation and or unrealized capital loss that reduce our shareholder equity keeping interest rate low on high quality short term or medium term debt security such we have experienced during recent year and thereby materially reducing our net investment income and result of operation the proceeds from security in our investment portfolio that mature or are otherwise disposed of continue to be reinvested in lower yielding security reducing the fair value of our investment if interest rate rise causing non performance or default on their obligation to by third party including customer issuer of security in our investment portfolio mortgage borrower and or reinsurance and or derivative counterparties making it more difficult to value certain of our investment security for example if trading becomes le frequent which could lead to significant period to period change in our estimate of the fair value of those security and cause period to period volatility in our net income and shareholder equity reducing our ability to issue short term debt security at attractive interest rate thereby increasing our interest expense and decreasing our result of operation and reducing our ability to issue other security although we seek within guideline we deem appropriate to match the duration of our asset and liability and to manage our credit and counterparty exposure failure adequately to do so could adversely affect our net income and our financial condition and in extreme circumstance our cash flow risk relating to our acquisition of aetnawe have limited experience in the insurance and managed health care industry which may hinder our ability to achieve our objective combined company we have limited experience operating an insurance and managed health care business and are relying in large part on the existing management of aetna to continue to manage our health care benefit business however there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to retain the service of such management if we fail to retain the existing management of aetna our ability to realize the anticipated benefit of the transaction may be adversely affected the aetna acquisition may not be accretive and may be dilutive to our earnings per share which may adversely affect our stock price although we currently project that the aetna acquisition will result in number of benefit including that it will be accretive to our earnings per share change in the estimate we use for these projection and the impact of future event and condition some of which we do not control could cause actual result to be lower than these projection in addition future event and page could decrease or delay the accretion that is currently projected or could result in dilution these event and condition include adverse change in market condition change in the regulatory environment additional transaction and integration related cost and other factor such the failure to realize some or all of the anticipated benefit of the aetna acquisition any dilution of decrease in or delay of any accretion to our earnings per share could cause our stock price to decline or grow at reduced rate we may fail to successfully combine the business and operation of cv health and aetna to realize the anticipated benefit and cost saving of the aetna acquisition within the anticipated timeframe or at all which could adversely affect our stock price the success of the aetna acquisition will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefit and cost saving from combining the business of cv health and aetna our ability to realize these anticipated benefit and cost saving is subject to certain risk including our ability to successfully combine the business of cv health and aetna whether the combined business will perform expected the possibility that we paid more for aetna than the value we will derive from the acquisition the reduction of our cash available for operation and other us and the incurrence of indebtedness to finance the acquisition and the assumption of known and unknown liability of aetna if we are not able to successfully combine the business of cv health and aetna within the anticipated time frame the anticipated cost saving and other benefit of the aetna acquisition may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected the combined business may not perform expected and our stock price may be adversely affected until the completion of the aetna acquisition we and aetna operated independently and there can be no assurance that our respective business can be integrated successfully it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key cv health or aetna employee the disruption of either company or both company ongoing business or in unexpected integration issue higher than expected integration cost and an overall post completion integration process that take longer than originally anticipated specifically issue that must be addressed in integrating the operation of cv health and aetna in order to realize the anticipated benefit of the aetna acquisition so the combined business performs expected include among other thing combining the company separate operational financial reporting and corporate function integrating the company technology product and service identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operation and asset harmonizing the company operating practice employee development compensation and benefit program internal control and other policy procedure and process addressing possible difference in business background corporate culture and management philosophy consolidating the company corporate administrative and information technology infrastructure coordinating sale distribution and marketing effort managing the movement of certain business and position to different location maintaining existing agreement with customer provider and vendor and avoiding delay in entering into new agreement with prospective customer provider and vendor operating in industry sector in which we and our current management may have little or no experience coordinating geographically dispersed organization consolidating office of cv health and aetna that are currently in or near the same location and effecting the action that are required by regulatory approval we obtained in connection with completing the aetna acquisition in addition at time the attention of certain member of our management and our resource will be focused on the integration of the business of the two company and diverted from day to day business operation which may adversely affect our business page future result may be adversely impacted if we do not effectively manage our expanded operation following completion of the aetna acquisition following completion of the aetna acquisition our business is significantly larger than the size of either cv health or aetna respective pre transaction business the combined company ability to successfully manage this expanded business will depend in part upon management ability to implement an effective integration of the two company and it ability to manage combined business with significantly larger size and scope with the associated increased cost and complexity there can be no assurance that the management of the combined company will be successful or that the combined company will realize the expected operating efficiency cost saving and other benefit currently anticipated from the aetna acquisition if we are not able to fully realize the expected operating efficiency cost saving and other benefit anticipated from the aetna acquisition or such benefit take longer to realize than expected our combined business may not perform expected and our stock price may be adversely affected we may have difficulty attracting motivating and retaining executive and other key employee following completion of the aetna acquisition our future success will depend in part on our ability to retain key executive and other employee of aetna uncertainty about the effect of the aetna acquisition on cv health and aetna employee may have an adverse effect on the combined company and consequently the combined business this uncertainty may impair our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel employee retention may be particularly challenging during the integration process employee of cv health and aetna may experience uncertainty about their future role in the combined business furthermore if key employee of cv health or aetna depart or are at risk of departing including because of issue relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration financial security or desire not to remain employee of the combined business we may have to incur significant cost in retaining such individual or in identifying hiring and retaining replacement for departing employee and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to the business of aetna and our ability to realize the anticipated benefit of the aetna acquisition may be materially and adversely affected accordingly no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract or retain key employee of aetna to the same extent that aetna wa able to attract or retain employee in the past the aetna integration process could disrupt our ongoing business and or operation party with which we do business may experience uncertainty associated with the aetna acquisition and or the post closing integration process including with respect to current or future business relationship with the combined business our business relationship including business relationship of our health care benefit segment may be subject to disruption customer member manufacturer provider vendor and others may attempt to negotiate change in existing business relationship or consider entering into business relationship with party other than the combined business these disruption could have material adverse effect on the business financial condition result of operation or prospect of one or more of the combined company business including material adverse effect on our ability to realize the anticipated benefit of the aetna acquisition our indebtedness following completion of the aetna acquisition is substantially greater than our indebtedness on stand alone basis and greater than the combined indebtedness of cv health and aetna existing prior to the announcement of the transaction this increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business flexibility and increase our borrowing cost in order to complete the aetna acquisition we incurred acquisition related debt financing of approximately billion and assumed aetna existing indebtedness with fair value of approximately billion our substantially increased indebtedness and higher debt to equity ratio following completion of the aetna acquisition in comparison to that of cv health prior to the aetna acquisition ha the effect among other thing of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic condition and increase our interest expense compared to pre aetna acquisition period in addition the amount of cash required to service our increased indebtedness level and thus the demand on our cash resource are greater than the amount of cash flow required to service the indebtedness of cv health or aetna individually prior to the aetna acquisition the increased level of indebtedness could also reduce fund available to fund our effort to combine our business with aetna and realize expected benefit of the aetna acquisition and or engage in investment in product development capital expenditure dividend payment share repurchase and other activity and may create competitive disadvantage for relative to other company with lower debt level page will continue to incur significant integration related cost in connection with the aetna acquisition we expect to continue to incur significant non recurring cost associated with combining the operation of cv health and aetna we expect to continue to incur significant integration related cost related to formulating and implementing integration plan including facility and system consolidation cost and employment related cost we continue to ass the magnitude of these cost and additional unanticipated cost may be incurred in the integration of the two company business we may not achieve the net benefit of such expenditure that we project associated with the elimination of duplicative cost well the realization of other efficiency related to the integration of our business in the near term or at all if we fail to realize the expected expense and other efficiency we project our
