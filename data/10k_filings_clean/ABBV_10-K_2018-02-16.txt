at least two disease modifying therapy dmts and for treatment with any other dmt is contraindicated or otherwise unsuitable marketing sale and distribution capabilitiesabbvie utilizes combination of dedicated commercial resource regional commercial resource and distributorships to market sell and distribute it product worldwide abbvie directs it primary marketing effort toward securing the prescription or recommendation of it brand of product by physician key opinion leader and other health care provider managed care provider for example health maintenance organization and pharmacy benefit manager hospital and state and federal government agency for example the united state department of veteran affair and the united state department of defense are also important customer abbvie also market directly to consumer although in the united state all of the company product must be sold pursuant to prescription outside of the united state abbvie focus it marketing effort on key opinion leader payer physician and country regulatory body abbvie also provides patient support program closely related to it product abbvie product are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesaler distributor government agency health care facility specialty pharmacy and independent retailer from abbvie owned distribution center and public warehouse although abbvie business not have significant seasonality abbvie product revenue may be affected by end customer and retail buying pattern fluctuation in wholesaler inventory level and other factor in the united state abbvie distributes pharmaceutical product principally independent wholesale distributor with some sale directly to pharmacy and patient in three wholesale distributor mckesson corporation cardinal health inc and amerisourcebergen corporation accounted for substantially all of abbvie sale in the united state no individual wholesaler accounted for greater of abbvie gross revenue in the united state outside the united state sale are made either directly to customer or through distributor depending on the market served these wholesaler purchase product from abbvie under standard term and condition of sale certain product are co marketed or co promoted with other company abbvie ha no single customer that if the customer lost would have material adverse effect on the company business no material portion of abbvie form is subject to renegotiation of profit or termination of contract at the election of the government order are generally filled on current basis and order backlog is not material to abbvie business competitionthe market for abbvie product are highly competitive abbvie competes with other research based pharmaceutical and biotechnology company that discover manufacture market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical product and biologics for example humira competes with anti tnf product and other competitive product intended to treat number of disease state and abbvie virology product compete with other available hcv treatment option the search for technological innovation in pharmaceutical product is significant aspect of competition the introduction of new product by competitor and change in medical practice and procedure result in product obsolescence price is also competitive factor in addition the substitution of generic pharmaceutical product for branded pharmaceutical product creates competitive pressure on abbvie product that do not have patent protection new product or treatment brought to market by abbvie competitor could cause revenue for abbvie product to decrease due to price reduction and sale volume decrease biosimilars competition for abbvie biologic product is affected by the approval of follow on biologics also known biosimilars biologics have added major therapeutic option for the treatment of many disease including some for which therapy were unavailable or inadequate the advent of biologics ha also raised complex regulatory issue and significant pharmacoeconomic concern the cost of developing and producing biologic therapy is typically dramatically higher than for conventional small molecule medication and because many expensive biologic medication are used for ongoing treatment of chronic disease such rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease or for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer significant investment in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to produce biologic product are significant investment in marketing distribution and sale organization activity which may limit the number of biosimilar competitor in the united state the fda regulates biologics under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the public health service act and implementing regulation the enactment of federal health care reform legislation in march provided pathway for approval of biosimilars under the public health service act but the approval process for and science behind biosimilars is more complex than the approval process for and science behind generic or other follow on version of small molecule product this added complexity is due to step needed to ensure that the safety and efficacy of biosimilars is highly similar to that of an original biologic such humira ultimate approval by the fda is dependent upon many factor including showing that the biosimilar is highly similar to the original product and ha no clinically meaningful difference from the original product in term of safety purity and potency the type of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data and study to demonstrate chemical similarity animal study including toxicity study and clinical study the law also requires that the biosimilar must be for condition of use approved for the original biologic and that the manufacturing facility meet the standard necessary to assure that the biosimilar is safe pure and potent furthermore the law provides that only biosimilar product that is determined to be interchangeable will be considered substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product to prove that biosimilar product is interchangeable the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the clinical result the original biologic product in any given patient and if the product is administered more than once in patient that safety risk and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching the law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the fda result it ultimate impact implementation and meaning remains subject to substantial uncertainty in the european union pathway for the approval of biosimilars ha existed since the product that have come to market to date have had mixed impact on the market share of incumbent product with significant variation by product other competitive product although number of competitive biologic branded product have been approved since humira wa first introduced in most have gained only modest share of the worldwide market abbvie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from orally administered product intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivitygenerally upon approval product may be entitled to certain kind of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regime abbvie intellectual property is materially valuable to the company and abbvie seek patent protection available in all significant market and or country for each product in development in the united state the expiration date for patent is year after the filing date given that patent relating to pharmaceutical product are form often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trial and other development activity required for regulatory approval the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly le than year the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of commonly known the hatch waxman act permit patent holder to seek patent extension commonly called patent term restoration for patent on product or process for making the product regulated by the federal food drug and cosmetic act the length of the patent extension is roughly based on percent of the period of time from the filing of an investigational new drug application nda for compound to the submission of the nda for such compound plus percent of the time period from nda submission to regulatory approval the extension however can not exceed five year and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval can not exceed year biological product licensed under the public health service act are similarly eligible for term of patent restoration pharmaceutical product may be entitled to other form of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval the scope length and requirement for each of these exclusivities vary both in the united state and in other jurisdiction in the united state if the fda approves drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved the product is typically entitled to five year of non patent regulatory exclusivity other product may be entitled to three year of exclusivity if approval wa based on the fda reliance on new clinical study essential to approval submitted by the nda applicant if the nda applicant study the product for use by child the fda may grant pediatric exclusivity which extends by day the longest existing exclusivity patent or regulatory related to the product for product that are either used to treat condition that afflict relatively small population or for which is not reasonable expectation that the research and development cost will be recovered the fda may designate the pharmaceutical an orphan drug and grant it seven year of market exclusivity applicable law and regulation dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which product is entitled upon it approval in any particular country in certain instance regulatory exclusivity may protect product where patent protection is no longer available or for period of time in excess of patent protection it is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled regulatory approval is obtained however given the length of time required to complete clinical development of pharmaceutical product the period of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not be expected to exceed minimum of three year and maximum of year these estimate do not consider other factor such the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of generic or other follow on product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity period biologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the biologics price competition and innovation act which wa passed on march title vii to the patient protection and affordable care act the law provides pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of year of exclusivity for the innovator biologic and potential additional day extension term for conducting pediatric study biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity discussed the law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement validity and enforceability the european union ha also created pathway for approval of biosimilars and ha published guideline for approval of certain biosimilar product the more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar product ha led to greater regulatory scrutiny and more rigorous requirement for approval of follow on biosimilar product than for small molecule generic pharmaceutical product which can reduce the effect of biosimilars on sale of the innovator biologic compared to the sale erosion caused by generic version of small molecule pharmaceutical product abbvie owns or ha licensed right to substantial number of patent and patent application abbvie license or owns patent portfolio of thousand of patent family each of which includes united state patent application and or issued patent and may also contain the non united state counterpart to these patent and application these patent and application including various patent that expire during the period to the late in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of abbvie business however abbvie belief that no single patent license trademark or related group of patent license or trademark except for those related to adalimumab which is sold under the trademark humira are material in relation to the company business whole the united state composition of matter that is compound patent covering adalimumab expired in december and the equivalent european union patent is expected to expire in the majority of european union country in october in the united state non composition of matter patent covering adalimumab expire no earlier than in addition the following patent license and trademark are significant those related to ibrutinib which is sold under the trademark imbruvica those related to ombitasvir paritaprevir ritonavir and dasabuvir which are sold under the trademark viekira pak viekirax exviera and holkira pak those related to glecaprevir and pibrentasvir which are sold under the trademark mavyret and maviret and those related to testosterone which is sold under the trademark androgel the united state composition of matter patent covering ibrutinib is expected to expire in the united state form of matter patent covering ombitasvir paritaprevir and dasabuvir are expected to expire in and respectively the united state composition of matter patent covering glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are expected to expire in abbvie may rely in some circumstance on trade secret to protect it technology however trade secret are difficult to protect abbvie seek to protect it technology and product candidate in part by confidentiality agreement with it employee consultant advisor contractor and collaborator these agreement may be breached and abbvie may not have adequate remedy for any breach in addition abbvie trade secret may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitor to the extent that abbvie employee consultant advisor contractor and collaborator use intellectual property owned by others in work for the company dispute may arise to the right in related or resulting know and invention licensing and other arrangementsin addition to it independent effort to develop and market product abbvie enters into arrangement such licensing arrangement strategic alliance co promotion arrangement co development and co marketing agreement and joint venture these licensing and other arrangement typically include among other term and condition non refundable upfront license fee milestone payment and royalty and or profit sharing obligation see note licensing acquisition and other arrangement other licensing acquisition activity to the consolidated financial statement included under item financial statement and supplementary data third party agreementsabbvie ha agreement with third party for process development product distribution analytical service and manufacturing of certain product abbvie procures certain product and service from limited number of supplier and in some case single supply source in addition abbvie ha agreement with third party for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing formulation and development service fill finish and packaging service transportation and distribution and logistics service for certain product abbvie doe not believe that these manufacturing related agreement are material because abbvie business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement in most case abbvie maintains alternate supply relationship that it can utilize without undue disruption of it manufacturing process if third party fails to perform it contractual obligation abbvie also maintains sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption abbvie is also party to certain collaboration and other arrangement discussed in note licensing acquisition and other arrangement other licensing acquisition activity to the consolidated financial statement included under item financial statement and supplementary data source and availability of raw materialsabbvie purchase in the ordinary course of business raw material and supply essential to it operation from numerous supplier around the world in addition certain medical device and component necessary for the manufacture of abbvie product are provided by unaffiliated third party supplier abbvie ha not experienced any recent significant availability problem or supply shortage that impacted fulfillment of product demand research and development activitiesabbvie make significant investment in research and development and ha numerous compound in clinical development including potential treatment for complex life threatening disease abbvie ability to discover and develop new compound is enhanced by the company use of integrated discovery and development project team which include chemist biologist physician and pharmacologist who work on the same compound team abbvie also partner with third party such biotechnology company other pharmaceutical company and academic institution to identify and prioritize promising new treatment that complement and enhance abbvie existing portfolio the research and development process generally begin with discovery research which focus on the identification of molecule that ha desired effect given disease if preclinical testing of an identified compound prof successful the compound move into clinical development which generally includes the following phase phase involves the first human test in small number of healthy volunteer or patient to ass safety tolerability and potential dosing phase test the drug efficacy against the disease in relatively small group of patient form phase test drug that demonstrates favorable result in the earlier phase in significantly larger patient population to demonstrate efficacy and safety based on regulatory criterion the clinical trial from all of the development phase provide the data required to prepare and submit an nda biological license application bla or other submission for regulatory approval to the fda or similar government agency outside the united state the specific requirement scope of clinical trial for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different country and geographic region the research and development process from discovery through new drug launch typically take to year and can be even longer the research and development of new pharmaceutical product ha significant amount of inherent uncertainty there is no guarantee or if molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch new drug or indication in addition to the development of new product and new formulation research and development project also may include phase trial sometimes called post marketing study for such project clinical trial are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding among other parameter the benefit and risk of an approved drug abbvie spent approximately billion in billion in and billion in on research to discover and develop new product indication and process and to improve existing product and process these expense consisted primarily of salary and related expense for personnel license fee consulting payment contract research clinical drug supply manufacturing the cost of laboratory equipment and facility clinical trial cost and collaboration fee and expense regulation discovery and clinical development united state securing approval to market new pharmaceutical product in the united state requires substantial effort and financial resource and take several year to complete the applicant must complete preclinical test and submit protocol to the fda commencing clinical trial clinical trial are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are conducted in sequential phase although the phase may overlap or be combined if the required clinical testing is successful the result are submitted to the fda in the form of an nda or bla requesting approval to market the product for one or more indication the fda review an nda or bla to determine whether product is safe and effective for it intended use and whether it manufacturing is compliant with current good manufacturing practice cgmp even if an nda or bla receives approval the applicant must comply with post approval requirement for example holder of an approval must report adverse reaction provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirement concerning advertising and promotional material and activity also quality control and manufacturing procedure must continue to conform to cgmp after approval and certain change to the manufacturing procedure and finished product must be included in the nda or bla and approved by the fda the fda periodically inspects manufacturing facility to ass compliance with cgmp which imposes extensive procedural and record keeping requirement in addition condition of approval the fda may require post marketing testing and surveillance to further ass and monitor the product safety or efficacy after commercialization which may require additional clinical trial or patient registry or additional work on chemistry manufacturing and control any post approval regulatory obligation and the cost of complying with such obligation could expand in the future outside the united state abbvie is subject to similar regulatory requirement outside the united state abbvie must obtain approval of clinical trial application or product from the applicable regulatory authority before it can commence clinical trial or marketing of the product the approval requirement and process for each country can vary and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval in the united state for example abbvie may submit marketing authorization in the european union under either centralized or decentralized procedure the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology product and many pharmaceutical product and provides for single marketing authorization that is valid for all european union member state under the centralized procedure single marketing authorization application is submitted to the european medicine agency ema after the agency evaluates the application it make recommendation to the european commission which make the final determination on whether to approve the application the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of individual national approval decision and is available for product that are not subject to the centralized procedure in japan application for approval of new product are made through the pharmaceutical and medical device agency pmda bridging study to demonstrate that the non japanese clinical data applies to japanese patient may be required after completing comprehensive review the pmda report to the ministry of health labour and welfare which then approves or denies the application form regulatory process in many emerging market continues to evolve many emerging market including those in asia generally require regulatory approval to have been obtained in large developed market such the united state or europe before the country will begin or complete it regulatory review process some country also require that local clinical study be conducted in order to obtain regulatory approval in the country the requirement governing the conduct of clinical trial and product licensing also vary in addition post approval regulatory obligation such adverse event reporting and cgmp compliance generally apply and may vary by country for example after marketing authorization ha been granted in the european union periodic safety report must be submitted and other pharmacovigilance measure may be required such risk management plan regulation commercialization distribution and manufacturingthe manufacture marketing sale promotion and distribution of abbvie product are subject to comprehensive government regulation government regulation by various national regional federal state and local agency both in the united state and other country address among other matter inspection of and control research and laboratory procedure clinical investigation product approval and manufacturing labeling packaging marketing and promotion pricing and reimbursement sampling distribution quality control post marketing surveillance record keeping storage and disposal practice abbvie operation are also affected by trade regulation in many country that limit the import of raw material and finished product and by law and regulation that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace including the united state foreign corrupt practice act and the united kingdom bribery act which provide guidance on corporate interaction with government official and require safeguard for the protection of personal data in addition abbvie is subject to law and regulation pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including state and federal anti kickback and false claim law in the united state prescription drug manufacturer such abbvie are also subject to tax well application product user establishment and other fee compliance with these law and regulation is costly and materially affect abbvie business among other effect health care regulation substantially increase the time difficulty and cost incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing product abbvie expects compliance with these regulation to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance failure to comply can delay the release of new product or result in regulatory and enforcement action the seizure or recall of product the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for product production and sale and other civil or criminal sanction including fine and penalty in addition to regulatory initiative abbvie business can be affected by ongoing study of the utilization safety efficacy and outcome of health care product and their component that are regularly conducted by industry participant government agency and others these study can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed product in some case these study have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuance of or limitation on marketing of such product domestically or worldwide and may give rise to claim for damage from person who believe have been injured result of their use access to human health care product continues to be subject of investigation and action by governmental agency legislative body and private organization in the united state and other country major focus is cost containment effort to reduce health care cost are also being made in the private sector notably by health care payer and provider which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measure abbvie expects insurer and provider to continue attempt to reduce the cost of health care product outside the united state many country control the price of health care product directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing coverage limitation or compulsory licensing budgetary pressure in the united state and in other country may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressure on abbvie product for the foreseeable future united state specifically federal law require pharmaceutical manufacturer to pay certain statutorily prescribed rebate to state medicaid program on prescription drug reimbursed under state medicaid plan and the effort by state to seek additional rebate affect abbvie business similarly the veteran health care act of prerequisite to participation in medicaid and other federal health care program requires that manufacturer extend additional discount on pharmaceutical product to various federal agency including the united state department of veteran affair department of defense and public health service entity and institution in addition recent legislative change would require similarly discounted price to be offered to tricare program beneficiary the veteran health care act of also established the drug discount program which requires pharmaceutical manufacturer to provide product at reduced price to various designated health care entity and facility in the united state most state also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting dispensing pharmacist to substitute different manufacturer generic version of pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed in addition the federal government follows diagnosis related group drg payment system for certain institutional service provided under form medicare or medicaid and ha implemented prospective payment system pps for service delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health setting drg and pps entitle health care facility to fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and or procedure rather than actual cost incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditure for many health care product medicare reimburses part drug based on average sale price plus certain percentage to account for physician administration cost which have been reduced in the hospital outpatient setting medicare enters into contract with private plan to negotiate price for most patient administered medicine delivered under part under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act together the affordable care act abbvie pay fee related to it pharmaceutical sale to government program in addition abbvie provides discount of for branded prescription drug sold to patient who fall into the medicare part coverage gap or donut hole the affordable care act also includes provision known the physician payment sunshine act which require manufacturer of drug and biologics covered under medicare and medicaid to record any transfer of value to physician and teaching hospital and to report this data to the center for medicare and medicaid service for subsequent public disclosure similar reporting requirement have also been enacted on the state level in the united state and an increasing number of country worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar law requiring disclosure of interaction with health care professional failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fine and or penalty abbvie expects debate to continue during at all government level worldwide over the marketing availability method of delivery and payment for health care product and service abbvie belief that future legislation and regulation in the market it serf could affect access to health care product and service increase rebate reduce price or the rate of price increase for health care product and service change health care delivery system create new fee and obligation for the pharmaceutical industry or require additional reporting and disclosure it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbvie or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matter discussed above abbvie is subject to corporate integrity agreement cia entered into by abbott on may that requires enhancement to abbvie compliance program and contains reporting obligation including disclosure of financial payment to doctor if abbvie fails to comply with the cia the office of inspector general for the united state department of health and human service may impose monetary penalty or exclude abbvie from federal health care program including medicare and medicaid european union the european union ha adopted directive and other legislation governing labeling advertising distribution supply pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical product such legislation provides mandatory standard throughout the european union and permit member state to supplement these standard with additional regulation european government also regulate pharmaceutical product price through their control of national health care system that fund large part of the cost of such product to consumer result patient are unlikely to use pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government in many european country the government either regulates the pricing of new product at launch or subsequent to launch through direct price control or reference pricing in recent year many country have also imposed new or additional cost containment measure on pharmaceutical product difference between national pricing regime create price differential within the european union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical product most government also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting pharmacist to substitute different manufacturer generic version of pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating that health care professional prescribe generic version in certain circumstance in addition government use reimbursement list to limit the pharmaceutical product that are eligible for reimbursement by national health care system japan in japan the national health insurance system maintains drug price list specifying which pharmaceutical product are eligible for reimbursement and the ministry of health labour and welfare set the price of the product on this list the government generally introduces price cut round every other year and also mandate price decrease for specific product new product judged innovative or useful that are indicated for pediatric use or that target orphan or small population disease however may be eligible for pricing premium the government ha also promoted the use of generic where available emerging market many emerging market take step to reduce pharmaceutical product price in some case through direct price control and in others through the promotion of generic alternative to branded pharmaceutical since abbvie market it product worldwide certain product of local nature and variation of product line must also meet other local regulatory requirement certain additional risk are inherent in conducting business outside the united form including price and currency exchange control change in currency exchange rate limitation on participation in local enterprise expropriation nationalization and other governmental action environmental mattersabbvie belief that it operation comply in all material respect with applicable law and regulation concerning environmental protection regulation under federal and state environmental law impose stringent limitation on emission and discharge to the environment from various manufacturing operation abbvie capital expenditure for pollution control in were approximately million and operating expenditure were approximately million in capital expenditure for pollution control are estimated to be approximately million and operating expenditure are estimated to be approximately million abbott wa identified one of many potentially responsible party in investigation and or remediation at several location in the united state including puerto rico under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known superfund some of these location were transferred to abbvie in connection with the separation and distribution and abbvie ha become party to these investigation and remediation abbott wa also engaged in remediation at several other site some of which have been transferred to abbvie in connection with the separation and distribution in cooperation with the environmental protection agency or similar agency while it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final cost related to those investigation and remediation activity abbvie belief that such cost together with other expenditure to maintain compliance with applicable law and regulation concerning environmental protection not have material adverse effect on the company financial position cash flow or result of operation employeesabbvie employed approximately person of january outside the united state some of abbvie employee are represented by union or work council abbvie belief that it ha good relation with it

compensation committee nomination and governance committee and public policy committee are all available on abbvie investor relation website www abbvieinvestor com item risk factor should carefully consider the following risk and other information in this form in evaluating abbvie and abbvie common stock any of the following risk could materially and adversely affect abbvie result of operation financial condition or cash flow the risk factor generally have been separated into two group risk related to abbvie business and risk related to abbvie common stock based on the information currently known to it abbvie belief that the following information identifies the most significant risk factor affecting it in each of these category of risk however the risk and uncertainty abbvie face are not limited to those set forth in the risk factor described and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence additional risk and uncertainty not presently known to abbvie or that abbvie currently belief to be immaterial may also adversely affect it business in addition past financial performance may not be reliable indicator of future performance and historical trend should not be used to anticipate result or trend in future period if any of the following risk and uncertainty develops into actual event these event could have material adverse effect on abbvie business result of operation financial condition or cash flow in such case the trading price of abbvie common stock could decline form risk related to abbvie businessthe expiration or loss of patent protection and license may adversely affect abbvie future revenue and operating earnings abbvie relies on patent trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery development manufacturing and sale of it product in particular patent protection is in the aggregate important in abbvie marketing of pharmaceutical product in the united state and most major market outside of the united state patent covering abbvie product normally provide market exclusivity which is important for the profitability of many of abbvie product patent for certain of it product expire abbvie will or could face competition from lower priced generic product the expiration or loss of patent protection for product typically is followed promptly by substitute that may significantly reduce sale for that product in short amount of time if abbvie competitive position is compromised because of generic or otherwise it could have material adverse effect on abbvie business and result of operation in addition proposal emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drug any such proposal that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition abbvie principal patent and trademark are described in greater detail in item business intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity and item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation result of operation and litigation regarding these patent is described in item legal proceeding the united state composition of matter patent for humira which is abbvie largest product and had worldwide net revenue of approximately billion in expired in december and the equivalent european union patent is expected to expire in the majority of european union country in october because humira is biologic and biologics can not be readily substituted it is uncertain impact the loss of patent protection would have on the sale of humira abbvie major product could lose patent protection earlier than expected which could adversely affect abbvie future revenue and operating earnings third party or government authority may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent abbvie patent and patent application for example manufacturer of generic pharmaceutical product file and may continue to file abbreviated new drug application with the fda seeking to market generic form of abbvie product prior to the expiration of relevant patent owned or licensed by abbvie by asserting that the patent are invalid unenforceable and or not infringed in addition petitioner have filed and may continue to file challenge to the validity of abbvie patent under the leahy smith america invents act which created inter partes review and post grant review procedure for challenging patent validity in administrative proceeding at the united state patent and trademark office although most of the challenge to abbvie intellectual property have come from other business government may also challenge intellectual property right for example court decision and potential legislation relating to patent such legislation regarding biosimilars and other regulatory initiative may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection in addition certain government outside the united state have indicated that compulsory license to patent may be sought to further their domestic policy or on the basis of national emergency such hiv aid if triggered compulsory license could diminish or eliminate sale and profit from those jurisdiction and negatively affect abbvie result of operation abbvie normally responds to challenge by vigorously defending it patent including by filing patent infringement lawsuit patent litigation administrative proceeding and other challenge to abbvie patent are costly and unpredictable and may deprive abbvie of market exclusivity for patented product to the extent abbvie intellectual property is successfully challenged or circumvented or to the extent such intellectual property doe not allow abbvie to compete effectively abbvie business will suffer to the extent that country do not enforce abbvie intellectual property right or require compulsory licensing of abbvie intellectual property abbvie future revenue and operating earnings will be reduced third party intellectual property may prevent abbvie from selling it product or have material adverse effect on abbvie future profitability and financial condition third party may claim that an abbvie product infringes upon their intellectual property resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require abbvie to enter into license agreement abbvie can not guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreement on commercially reasonable term successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject abbvie to significant damage or an injunction form the manufacture sale or use of the affected abbvie product or product any of these event could have material adverse effect on abbvie profitability and financial condition any significant event that adversely affect humira revenue could have material and negative impact on abbvie result of operation and cash flow humira accounted for approximately of abbvie total net revenue in any significant event that adversely affect humira revenue could have material adverse impact on abbvie result of operation and cash flow these event could include loss of patent protection for humira the commercialization of biosimilars of humira the discovery of previously unknown side effect or impaired efficacy increased competition from the introduction of new more effective or le expensive treatment and discontinuation or removal from the market of humira for any reason abbvie research and development effort may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful product and technology which may cause it revenue and profitability to decline to remain competitive abbvie must continue to launch new product and new indication and or brand extension for existing product and such launch must generate revenue sufficient both to cover it substantial research and development cost and to replace revenue of profitable product that are lost to or displaced by competing product or therapy failure to do would have material adverse effect on abbvie revenue and profitability accordingly abbvie commits substantial effort fund and other resource to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditure without any assurance that it effort will be commercially successful high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new product and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process including after significant fund have been invested product that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reason including failure to demonstrate effectiveness safety concern superior safety or efficacy of competing therapy failure to achieve positive clinical or pre clinical outcome beyond the current standard of care inability to obtain necessary regulatory approval or delay in the approval of new product and new indication limited scope of approved us excessive cost to manufacture the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property right or infringement of the intellectual property right of others decision about research study made early in the development process of pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval more detailed study may demonstrate additional benefit that can help in the marketing but they also consume time and resource and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for approval abbvie can not guarantee that proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decision in this area would not adversely affect abbvie future result of operation even if abbvie successfully develops and market new product or enhancement to it existing product they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preference changing industry standard or competitor innovation abbvie innovation may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practice or uncertainty over third party reimbursement abbvie can not state with certainty when or whether any of it product under development will be launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compound or product or whether any product will be commercially successful failure to launch successful new product or new indication for existing product may cause abbvie product to become obsolete causing abbvie revenue and operating result to suffer portion of abbvie near term pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaboration with third party which may adversely affect the development and sale of it product abbvie depends on alliance with pharmaceutical and biotechnology company for portion of the product in it near term pharmaceutical pipeline for example abbvie is collaborating with roche holding ag to develop and commercialize next generation bcl inhibitor venclexta venetoclax for patient with relapsed refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia and abbvie is investigating it efficacy for additional indication failure by these party to meet their contractual regulatory or other obligation to abbvie or any disruption in the relationship between abbvie and these third party could have an adverse effect on abbvie pharmaceutical pipeline and business in addition abbvie collaborative relationship for research and development extend for many year and may give rise to dispute regarding the relative right obligation and revenue of abbvie and it collaboration partner including the ownership of intellectual property and associated right and obligation this could result in the loss of intellectual property right or protection delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical product and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation administrative proceeding or arbitration form biologics carry unique risk and uncertainty which could have negative impact on future result of operation the successful discovery development manufacturing and sale of biologics is long expensive and uncertain process there are unique risk and uncertainty with biologics for example access to and supply of necessary biological material such cell line may be limited and governmental regulation restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such material in addition the development manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulation that are often more complex and extensive than the regulation applicable to other pharmaceutical product manufacturing biologics especially in large quantity is often complex and may require the use of innovative technology such manufacturing also requires facility specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedure biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production input are derived from living animal or plant material and some biologics can not be made synthetically failure to successfully discover develop manufacture and sell biologics including humira could adversely impact abbvie business and result of operation abbvie biologic product are subject to competition from biosimilars the biologics price competition and innovation act creates framework for the approval of biosimilars in the united state and could allow competitor to reference data from biologic product already approved in europe the european commission ha granted marketing authorization for several biosimilars pursuant to set of general and product class specific guideline for biosimilar approval issued over the past few year in addition company are developing biosimilars in other country that could compete with abbvie biologic product competitor are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing abbvie biologic product abbvie product may become subject to competition from such biosimilars with the attendant competitive pressure and consequence expiration or successful challenge of abbvie applicable patent right could also trigger competition from other product assuming any relevant exclusivity period ha expired result abbvie could face more litigation and administrative proceeding with respect to the validity and or scope of patent relating to it biologic product new product and technological advance by abbvie competitor may negatively affect abbvie result of operation abbvie competes with other research based pharmaceutical and biotechnology company that discover manufacture market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical product and biologics for example humira competes with anti tnf product and other competitive product intended to treat number of disease state and abbvie virology product compete with other available hepatitis treatment option these competitor may introduce new product or develop technological advance that compete with abbvie product in therapeutic area such immunology virology liver disease oncology and neuroscience abbvie can not predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitor of new product or technological advance such competing product may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower price or superior performance feature than abbvie product and this could negatively impact abbvie business and result of operation the manufacture of many of abbvie product is highly exacting and complex process and if abbvie or one of it supplier encounter problem manufacturing abbvie product abbvie business could suffer the manufacture of many of abbvie product is highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirement problem may arise during manufacturing for variety of reason including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocol and procedure problem with raw material delay related to the construction of new facility or the expansion of existing facility including those intended to support future demand for abbvie product change in manufacturing production site and limit to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirement change in the type of product produced physical limitation that could inhibit continuous supply man made or natural disaster and environmental factor if problem arise during the production of batch of product that batch of product may have to be discarded and abbvie may experience product shortage or incur added expense this could among other thing lead to increased cost lost revenue damage to customer relation time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar loss with respect to other batch or product if problem are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability cost may also be incurred form abbvie us number of product in it pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing process that are sourced from single supplier and an interruption in the supply of those product could adversely affect abbvie business and result of operation abbvie us number of product in it pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing process that are sourced from single supplier the failure of these single source supplier to fulfill their contractual obligation in timely manner or result of regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at manufacturing site may impair abbvie ability to deliver it product to customer on timely and competitive basis which could adversely affect abbvie business and result of operation finding an alternative supplier could take significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the product and the need to obtain regulatory approval abbvie can not guarantee that it will be able to reach agreement with alternative provider or that regulatory authority would approve abbvie use of such alternative abbvie doe however carry business interruption insurance which provides degree of protection in the case of failure by single source supplier significant safety or efficacy issue could arise for abbvie product which could have material adverse effect on abbvie revenue and financial condition pharmaceutical product receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trial of limited duration following regulatory approval these product will be used over longer period of time in many patient investigator may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive study if new safety or efficacy issue are reported or if new scientific information becomes available including result of post marketing phase trial or if government change standard regarding safety efficacy or labeling abbvie may be required to amend the condition of use for product for example abbvie may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on product label or narrow it approved indication either of which could reduce the product market acceptance if safety or efficacy issue with an abbvie product arise sale of the product could be halted by abbvie or by regulatory authority safety or efficacy issue affecting supplier or competitor product also may reduce the market acceptance of abbvie product new data about abbvie product or product similar to it product could negatively impact demand for abbvie product due to real or perceived safety issue or uncertainty regarding efficacy and in some case could result in product withdrawal furthermore new data and information including information about product misuse may lead government agency professional society practice management group or organization involved with various disease to publish guideline or recommendation related to the use of abbvie product or the use of related therapy or place restriction on sale such guideline or recommendation may lead to lower sale of abbvie product abbvie is subject to product liability claim and lawsuit that may adversely affect it business and result of operation in the ordinary course of business abbvie is the subject of product liability claim and lawsuit alleging that abbvie product or the product of other company that it promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patient product liability claim and lawsuit and safety alert or product recall regardless of their ultimate outcome may have material adverse effect on abbvie business result of operation and reputation and on it ability to attract and retain customer consequence may also include additional cost decrease in market share for the product in question lower income and exposure to other claim product liability loss are self insured abbvie is subject to cost containment effort and pricing pressure that could cause reduction in future revenue and operating earnings and change in the term of rebate and chargeback program which are common in the pharmaceutical industry could have material adverse effect on abbvie operation cost containment effort by government and private organization are described in greater detail in item business regulation commercialization distribution and manufacturing to the extent these cost containment effort are not offset by greater demand increased patient access to health care or other factor abbvie future revenue and operating earnings will be reduced in the united state the european union and other country abbvie business ha experienced downward pressure on product pricing and this pressure could increase in the future abbvie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing in the united state practice of managed care group and institutional and governmental purchaser and united state federal law and regulation related to medicare and medicaid including the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of and the patient protection and affordable care act contribute to pricing pressure the potential for continuing form change to the health care system in the united state and the increased purchasing power of entity that negotiate on behalf of medicare medicaid and private sector beneficiary could result in additional pricing pressure in numerous major market worldwide the government play significant role in funding health care service and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical product consequently in those market abbvie is subject to government decision making and budgetary action with respect to it product in particular many european country have ongoing government mandated price reduction for many pharmaceutical product and abbvie anticipates continuing pricing pressure in europe difference between country in pricing regulation could lead to third party cross border trading in abbvie product that result in reduction in future revenue and operating earnings rebate related to government program such fee for service medicaid or medicaid managed care program arise from law and regulation abbvie can not predict if additional government initiative to contain health care cost or other factor could lead to new or modified regulatory requirement that include higher or incremental rebate or discount other rebate and discount program arise from contractual agreement with private payer various factor including market factor and the ability of private payer to control patient access to product may provide payer the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebate or discount that could have material adverse effect on abbvie operation abbvie is subject to numerous governmental regulation and it can be costly to comply with these regulation and to develop compliant product and process abbvie product are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous international supranational federal and state authority described in item business regulation discovery and clinical development the process of obtaining regulatory approval to market pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming and approval might not be granted for future product or additional indication or us of existing product on timely basis if at all delay in the receipt of or failure to obtain approval for future product or new indication and us could result in delayed realization of product revenue reduction in revenue and substantial additional cost in addition abbvie can not guarantee that it will remain compliant with applicable regulatory requirement once approval ha been obtained for product these requirement include among other thing regulation regarding manufacturing practice product labeling and advertising and post marketing reporting including adverse event report and field alert due to manufacturing quality concern abbvie must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulation possible regulatory action could result in substantial modification to abbvie business practice and operation refund recall or seizure of abbvie product total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of abbvie or it supplier facility while abbvie or it supplier remedy the alleged violation the inability to obtain future approval and withdrawal or suspension of current product from the market any of these event could disrupt abbvie business and have material adverse effect on it business and result of operation law and regulation affecting government benefit program could impose new obligation on abbvie require it to change it business practice and restrict it operation in the future the health care industry is subject to various federal state and international law and regulation pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement rebate price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse in the united state these law include anti kickback and false claim law the medicaid rebate statute the veteran health care act and individual state law relating to pricing and sale and marketing practice violation of these law may be punishable by criminal and or civil sanction including in some instance substantial fine imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care program including medicare medicaid and veteran administration health program these law and regulation are broad in scope and they are subject to change and evolving interpretation which could require abbvie to incur substantial cost associated with compliance or to alter one or more of it sale or marketing practice in addition violation of these law or allegation of such violation could disrupt abbvie business and result in material adverse effect on it business and result of operation abbvie could be subject to increased monetary penalty and or other sanction including exclusion from federal health care program if it fails to comply with the term of the may resolution of the department of justice investigation into sale and marketing activity for depakote on may abbott settled united state federal and state investigation into it sale and marketing activity for depakote by pleading guilty to misdemeanor violation of the food drug and cosmetic act agreeing to pay form million in criminal fine and forfeiture and approximately million to resolve civil claim and submitting to term of probation the term of probation ended january upon abbvie satisfying all of the probation condition however if abbvie violates any remaining term of the plea agreement it may face additional monetary sanction and other such remedy the court deems appropriate in addition abbott entered into five year cia with the office of inspector general for the united state department of health and human service oig the effective date of the cia is october the obligation of the cia have transferred to and become fully binding on abbvie the cia requires enhancement to abbvie compliance program fulfillment of reporting and monitoring obligation management certification and resolution from abbvie board of director among other requirement compliance with the requirement of the settlement will impose additional cost and burden on abbvie including in the form of employee training third party review compliance monitoring reporting obligation and management attention if abbvie fails to comply with the cia the oig may impose monetary penalty or exclude abbvie from federal health care program including medicare and medicaid abbvie and abbott may be subject to third party claim and shareholder lawsuit in connection with the settlement and abbvie may be required to indemnify all or portion of abbott cost the international nature of abbvie business subject it to additional business risk that may cause it revenue and profitability to decline abbvie business is subject to risk associated with business internationally including in emerging market net revenue outside of the united state make approximately of abbvie total net revenue in the risk associated with abbvie operation outside the united state include fluctuation in currency exchange rate change in medical reimbursement policy and program multiple legal and regulatory requirement that are subject to change and that could restrict abbvie ability to manufacture market and sell it product differing local product preference and product requirement trade protection measure and import or export licensing requirement difficulty in establishing staffing and managing operation differing labor regulation potentially negative consequence from change in or interpretation of tax law political and economic instability including sovereign debt issue price and currency exchange control limitation on participation in local enterprise expropriation nationalization and other governmental action inflation recession and fluctuation in interest rate potential deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain non country including in europe and latin america and potential penalty or other adverse consequence for violation of anti corruption anti bribery and other similar law and regulation including the united state foreign corrupt practice act and the united kingdom bribery act event contemplated by these risk may individually or in the aggregate have material adverse effect on abbvie revenue and profitability if abbvie doe not effectively and profitably commercialize imbruvica abbvie revenue and financial condition could be adversely affected abbvie must effectively and profitably commercialize imbruvica by creating and meeting continued market demand achieving market acceptance and generating product sale ensuring that the active pharmaceutical ingredient for imbruvica and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantity and in compliance with requirement of the fda and similar foreign regulatory agency and with acceptable quality and pricing to meet commercial demand and ensuring that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers imbruvica to abbvie customer the commercialization of form imbruvica may not be successful due to among other thing unexpected challenge from competitor new safety issue or concern being reported that may impact or narrow the approved indication the relative price of imbruvica compared to alternative treatment option and change to the label for imbruvica that further restrict it marketing if the commercialization of imbruvica is unsuccessful abbvie ability to generate revenue from product sale and realize the anticipated benefit of the merger with pharmacyclics will be adversely affected abbvie may acquire other business license right to technology or product form alliance or dispose of asset which could cause it to incur significant expense and could negatively affect profitability abbvie may pursue acquisition technology licensing arrangement and strategic alliance or dispose of some of it asset part of it business strategy abbvie may not complete these transaction in timely manner on cost effective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefit if abbvie is successful in making an acquisition the product and technology that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resource and investment than originally anticipated abbvie may not be able to integrate acquisition successfully into it existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liability abbvie could also experience negative effect on it reported result of operation from acquisition or disposition related charge amortization of expense related to intangible and charge for impairment of long term asset these effect could cause deterioration of abbvie credit rating and result in increased borrowing cost and interest expense additionally change in abbvie structure operation revenue cost or efficiency resulting from major transaction such acquisition divestiture merger alliance restructurings or other strategic initiative may result in greater than expected cost may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulty including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate abbvie is dependent on wholesale distributor for distribution of it product in the united state and accordingly it result of operation could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulty in three wholesale distributor mckesson corporation cardinal health inc and amerisourcebergen corporation accounted for substantially all of abbvie sale in the united state if one of it significant wholesale distributor encounter financial or other difficulty such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it doe with abbvie and abbvie may be unable to collect all the amount that the distributor owes it on timely basis or at all which could negatively impact abbvie business and result of operation abbvie ha debt obligation that could adversely affect it business and it ability to meet it obligation the amount of debt that abbvie ha incurred and intends to incur could have important consequence to abbvie and it investor these consequence include among other thing requiring portion of abbvie cash flow from operation to make interest payment on this debt and reducing the

to the strengthening of the euro and other foreign currency on the translation of the company euro denominated asset and cash denominated in foreign currency the unfavorable exchange rate change in were primarily due to the devaluation of abbvie net monetary asset denominated in the venezuelan bolivar the unfavorable exchange rate change in were principally due to the weakening of the euro and other foreign currency on the translation of the company euro denominated asset and cash denominated in foreign currency prior to the enactment of the tax cut and job act in december significant portion of cash and equivalent were considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiary the enactment of tax reform significantly changed the corporate tax system including imposing mandatory one

regarding the provisional estimate of these tax liability abbvie enters into collaboration arrangement with third party that may require future milestone payment to third party contingent upon the achievement of certain development regulatory or commercial milestone individually these arrangement are insignificant in any one annual reporting period however if milestone for multiple product covered by these arrangement would happen to be reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the result of operation in that period from business perspective the payment are viewed positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is generating or is more likely to generate future cash flow from product sale it is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestone will be achieved or the timing for achievement result these potential payment are not included in the table of contractual obligation see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information on these collaboration arrangement form critical accounting policy and estimatesthe preparation of

critical these most significantly impact the company financial condition and result of operation and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgment often result of the need to make estimate about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain actual result may vary from these estimate revenue recognitionabbvie recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery ha occurred the sale price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the sale price is reasonably assured revenue from product sale is recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer rebate abbvie provides rebate to pharmacy benefit manager state government medicaid program insurance company that administer medicare drug plan wholesaler group purchasing

billion in billion in and billion in rebate amount are typically based upon the volume of purchase using contractual or statutory price which may vary by product and by payer for each type of rebate the factor used in the calculation of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the product subject to the rebate the applicable price term and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate which can be significant in order to establish it rebate and chargeback accrual the company us both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claim processing lag time for each type of rebate to estimate the rebate percentage or net price the company track sale by product and by customer or payer the company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesaler available prescription volume information product pricing historical experience and other factor in order to determine the adequacy of it reserve abbvie regularly monitor it reserve and record adjustment when rebate trend rebate program and contract term legislative change or other significant event indicate that change in the reserve

the reserve for cash discount is readily determinable because the company experience of payment history is fairly consistent product return can be reliably estimated based on the company historical return experience pension and other post employment benefitsabbvie engages outside actuary to assist in the determination of the obligation and cost under the pension and other post employment benefit plan that are direct obligation of abbvie the valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plan are calculated using actuarial assumption the significant assumption which are reviewed annually include the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan asset and the health care cost trend rate the significant assumption used in determining these calculation are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statement the discount rate is selected based on current market rate on high quality fixed income investment at december each year abbvie employ yield curve approach for country where robust bond market exists the yield curve is developed using high quality bond the yield curve approach reflects the plan specific cash flow duration in calculating the benefit obligation by applying the corresponding individual spot rate along the yield curve beginning in abbvie also reflected the plan specific cash flow and applied to the corresponding individual spot rate along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portion of expense for other country abbvie review various index such corporate bond and government bond benchmark to estimate the discount rate abbvie assumed discount rate have significant effect on the amount reported for defined benefit pension and other post employment plan of december basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effect on abbvie calculation of net periodic benefit cost in and projected benefit obligation of december basis point in million bracket denote reduction increase decreasedefined benefit plan service and interest cost benefit obligation post employment plan service and interest cost benefit obligation december abbvie elected to change the method it us to estimate the service and interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost historically abbvie estimated these service and interest cost component of this expense utilizing single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period in late abbvie elected to utilize full yield curve approach in the estimation of these component by applying the specific spot rate along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flow abbvie elected to make this change to provide more precise measurement of service and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flow to the corresponding spot yield curve rate abbvie accounted for this change prospectively change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from change in accounting principle this change reduced abbvie net periodic benefit cost by approximately million in this change had no effect on the expense and did not affect the measurement of abbvie total benefit obligation the expected long term rate of return is based on the asset allocation historical performance and the current view of expected future return abbvie considers these input with long term focus to avoid short term market influence the current long term rate of return on plan asset for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust actual and target asset allocation abbvie assumed expected long term rate of return ha significant effect on the amount reported for defined benefit pension plan of december and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in one percentage point change in assumed expected long term rate of return on plan asset would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plan in by million the health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trend and current view on projected future health care cost increase the current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan assumed health care cost trend rate have significant effect on the amount reported for health care plan of form december and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effect on abbvie calculation of net periodic benefit cost in and the projected benefit obligation of december one percentage point in million bracket denote reduction

statement for additional information loss contingency provision are recorded for probable loss at management best estimate of loss or when best estimate can not be made minimum loss contingency amount within probable range is recorded accordingly abbvie is often initially unable to develop best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded information becomes known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provision or best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provision occasionally best estimate amount is changed to lower amount when event result in an expectation of more favorable outcome than previously expected valuation of goodwill and intangible assetsabbvie ha acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible asset in connection with business combination that abbvie record at fair value transaction involving the purchase or sale of intangible asset occur with some frequency between company in the pharmaceutical industry and valuation are usually based on discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion the discounted cash flow model requires assumption about the timing and amount of future net cash flow risk cost of capital terminal value and market participant each of these factor can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset ipr acquired in business combination is capitalized an indefinite lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained at which time it is accounted for definite lived asset and amortized over it estimated useful life or discontinuation at which point the intangible asset will be written ipr acquired in transaction that are not business combination is expensed immediately unless deemed to have an alternative future use payment made to third party subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life abbvie review the recoverability of definite lived intangible asset whenever event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment see note to the consolidated financial statement for further information annually the company test it goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factor to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is le than it carrying amount some of the factor considered in the assessment include general macro economic condition condition specific to the industry and market cost factor which could have significant effect on earnings or cash flow the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained decline in the company share price if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is le than it carrying amount quantitative impairment test is performed abbvie test indefinite lived intangible asset using quantitative impairment test for it quantitative impairment test the company us an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rate change in working capital use foreign currency exchange rate the selection of an appropriate discount rate asset grouping and other assumption and estimate the form and assumption used are consistent with the company business plan and market participant view of company and similar company the use of alternative estimate and assumption could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and potentially result in different impact to the company result of operation actual result may differ from the company estimate contingent considerationthe fair value measurement of contingent consideration liability are determined of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable input including the discount rate estimated probability and timing of achieving specified development regulatory and commercial milestone and the estimated amount of future sale of the acquired product still in development contingent consideration liability are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved change to the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from change to one or number of input including discount rate the probability of achieving the milestone the time required to achieve the milestone and estimated future sale significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these input change to the input described above could have material impact on the company financial position and result of operation in any given period at december basis point increase decrease in the assumed discount rate would have decreased increased the value of the contingent consideration liability by approximately million additionally at december five percentage point increase decrease in the assumed probability of success across all potential indication would have increased decreased
