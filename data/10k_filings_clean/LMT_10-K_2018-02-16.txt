connection with the name change the information for this segment for all period included in these consolidated financial statement ha been labeled using the new name on august we completed the divestiture of the information system global solution is business which merged with subsidiary of leidos holding inc leidos in reverse morris trust transaction accordingly the operating result of the

our consolidated statement of cash flow we retained the cash part of the transaction see note acquisition and divestiture for additional information about the divestiture of the is business on august we increased our ownership interest in the awe management limited awe joint venture which operates the united kingdom nuclear deterrent program from to at which time we began consolidating awe consequently our operating result include of awe sale and of it operating profit prior to increasing our ownership interest we accounted for our investment in awe using the equity method of accounting under the equity method we recognized of awe earnings or loss and no sale accordingly prior to august the date we obtained control we recorded of awe net earnings in our operating result and subsequent to august we recognized of awe sale and of it operating profit see note acquisition and divestiture for additional information about the change in ownership of awe on november we completed

business segment the operating result and cash flow of sikorsky have been included on our consolidated statement of earnings and consolidated statement of cash flow since the november acquisition date additionally the asset and liability of sikorsky are included in our consolidated balance sheet of december and december see note acquisition and divestiture for additional information about the acquisition of sikorsky and related final purchase accounting during the fourth quarter of we realigned certain program among our business segment the amount discussion and presentation of our business segment for all period presented in these consolidated financial statement reflect the program realignment use of estimate we prepare our consolidated financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle gaap in we are required to make estimate and assumption that affect the amount reported in the consolidated financial statement and accompanying note we base these estimate on historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying amount of asset and liability that are not readily apparent from other source our actual result may differ materially from these estimate significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement include are not limited to accounting for sale and cost recognition postretirement benefit plan environmental receivables and evaluation of goodwill and other asset for impairment income tax including deferred tax asset fair value measurement and contingency sale and earnings we record net sale and estimated profit for substantially all of our contract using the percentage of completion method for fixed price and cost reimbursable contract for product and service with the government sale are recorded on all time and material contract the work is performed based on agreed upon hourly rate and allowable cost we account for our service contract with non government customer using the service method of accounting we classify net sale product or service on our consolidated statement of earnings based on the attribute of the underlying contract percentage of completion method the percentage of completion method for product contract depends on the nature of the product provided under the contract for example for contract that require to perform significant level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract and or to deliver minimal quantity sale are recorded using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion under the cost to cost method of accounting we recognize sale and an estimated profit cost are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred cost bear to total estimated cost for contract that require to provide substantial number of similar item without significant level of development we record sale and an estimated profit on percentage of completion basis using unit of delivery the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract for contract to provide service to the government sale are generally recorded using the cost to cost method award and incentive fee well penalty related to contract performance are considered in estimating sale and profit rate on contract accounted for under the percentage of completion method estimate of award fee are based on past experience and anticipated performance we record incentive or penalty there is sufficient information to ass anticipated contract performance incentive provision that increase or decrease earnings based solely on single significant event are not recognized the event occurs accounting for contract using the percentage of completion method requires judgment relative to assessing risk estimating contract sale and cost including estimating award and incentive fee and penalty related to performance and making assumption for schedule and technical issue due to the number of year may take to complete many of our contract and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contract the estimation of total sale and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variable and accordingly is subject to change when adjustment in estimated total contract sale or estimated total cost are required any change from prior estimate are recognized in the current period for the inception to date effect of such change when estimate of total cost to be incurred on contract exceed estimate of total sale to be earned provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined many of our contract span several year and include highly complex technical requirement at the outset of contract we identify and monitor risk to the achievement of the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract and ass the effect of those risk on our estimate of total cost to complete the contract the estimate consider the technical requirement newly developed product versus mature product the schedule and associated task the number and type of milestone event and cost material labor subcontractor overhead and the estimated cost to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreement sometimes referred to offset agreement required under certain contract with international customer the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risk surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirement schedule and cost in the initial estimated total cost to complete the contract profit booking rate may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risk surrounding the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract which decrease the estimated total cost to complete the contract conversely our profit booking rate may decrease if the estimated total cost to complete the contract increase all of the estimate are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate in addition comparability of our business segment sale operating profit and operating margin may be impacted by change in profit booking rate on our contract accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting increase in the profit booking rate typically referred to risk retirement usually relate to revision in the estimated total cost that reflect improved condition on particular contract conversely condition on particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated total cost to complete and reduction in the profit booking rate increase or decrease in profit booking rate are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception to date effect of such change segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other item favorable item may include the positive resolution of contractual matter cost recovery on restructuring charge insurance recovery and gain on sale of asset unfavorable item may include the adverse resolution of contractual matter restructuring charge except for significant severance action such those mentioned in note restructuring charge which are excluded from segment operating result reserve for dispute asset impairment and loss on sale of certain asset segment operating profit and item such risk retirement reduction of profit booking rate or other matter are presented net of state income tax in estimate previously disclosed we have program to design integrate and install an air missile defense system for an international customer that ha experienced performance issue and for which we have periodically accrued reserve in we revised our estimated cost to complete the program eadge consequence of ongoing performance matter and recorded an additional charge of million million or per share tax at our rms business segment of december cumulative loss including reserve remained at approximately million on this program we are continuing to monitor the viability of the program and the available option and could record additional charge in future period however based on the reserve already accrued and our current estimate of the cost to complete the program at this time we do not anticipate that additional charge if any would be material we have two commercial satellite program at our space business segment for which we have experienced performance issue related to the development and integration of modernized lm satellite platform these commercial program require the development of new satellite technology to enhance the lm power propulsion and electronics among other item the enhanced satellite is expected to benefit other commercial and government satellite program we have periodically revised our estimated cost to complete these developmental commercial program we have recorded cumulative loss of approximately million of december including approximately million million or per share after tax recorded during the year ended december these loss reflect our estimated total loss on the program we will continue to incur unrecovered cost each period until we complete these program and may have to record additional loss reserve in future period which could be material to our operating result while we do not currently anticipate recording additional loss reserve the program remain developmental and challenge in the delivery and integration of new satellite technology anomaly discovered during system testing requiring repair or rework further schedule delay and potential penalty could require that we record additional reserve we do not currently expect to be able to meet the delivery schedule under the contract and have informed the customer the customer could seek to exercise termination right under the contract in which case we would have to refund the payment we have received and pay certain penalty however we think the probability that the customer will seek to exercise any termination right is remote the delay beyond the termination date is modest and the customer have an immediate need for the satellite our consolidated net adjustment not related to volume including net profit booking rate adjustment and other matter net of state income tax increased segment operating profit by approximately billion in both and and billion in these adjustment increased net earnings by approximately million per share in million per share in and billion per share in service method under fixed price service contract we are paid predetermined fixed amount for specified scope of work and generally have full responsibility for the cost associated with the contract and the resulting profit or loss we record net sale under fixed price service contract with non government customer on straight line basis over the period of contract performance unless evidence suggests that net sale are earned or the obligation are fulfilled in different pattern for cost reimbursable contract for service to non government customer we record net sale service are performed except for award and incentive fee award and incentive fee are recorded when are fixed or determinable generally at the date the amount is communicated to by the customer this approach result in the recognition of such fee at contractual interval typically every six month throughout the contract and is dependent on the customer process for notification of award and issuance of formal notification cost for all service contract are expensed incurred research and development and similar cost except for certain arrangement described below we account for independent research and development cost part of the general and administrative cost that are allocated among all of our contract and program in progress under government contractual arrangement and charged to cost of sale under certain arrangement in which customer share in product development cost our portion of unreimbursed cost is expensed incurred in cost of sale independent research and development cost charged to cost of sale totaled billion in million in and million in cost we incur under customer sponsored research and development program pursuant to contract are included in net sale and cost of sale stock based compensation compensation cost related to all share based payment is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award we generally recognize the compensation cost ratably over three year vesting period net of estimated forfeiture at each reporting date the number of share is adjusted to the number ultimately expected to vest income tax we calculate our provision for income tax using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax asset and liability are recognized based on the future tax consequence attributable to temporary difference that exist the financial statement carrying amount of asset and liability and respective tax base well from operating loss and tax credit carry forward we measure deferred tax asset and liability using enacted tax rate that will apply in the year in which we expect the temporary difference to be recovered or paid periodically ass our tax exposure related to period that are open to examination based on the latest available information we evaluate our tax position to determine whether the position will likely than not be sustained upon examination by the internal revenue service irs or other taxing authority if we not reach more likely than not determination no benefit is recorded if we determine that the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained we record the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized when the tax position is settled we record interest and penalty related to income tax component of income tax expense on our consolidated statement of earnings interest and penalty were not material cash and cash equivalent cash equivalent include highly liquid instrument with original maturity of day or le receivables receivables include amount billed and currently due from customer and unbilled cost and accrued profit primarily related to sale on long term contract that have been recognized but not yet billed to customer pursuant to contract provision agency of the government and certain other customer have title to or security interest in asset related to such contract result of advance performance based payment and progress payment we reflect those advance and payment an offset to the related receivables balance for contract that we account for on percentage of completion basis using the cost to cost method to measure progress towards completion on occasion our customer may seek deferred payment term to purchase our product in connection with these transaction we may at our customer request enter into arrangement for the non recourse sale of customer receivables to unrelated third party financial institution for accounting purpose these transaction are not discounted and are treated sale of receivables we have no continuing involvement the sale proceeds from the financial institution are reflected in our operating cash flow on the statement of cash flow during we sold approximately million of customer receivables there were no gain or loss related to sale of these receivables inventory we record inventory at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value cost on long term contract and program in progress represent recoverable cost incurred for production or contract specific facility and equipment allocable operating overhead advance to supplier and in the case of contract with the government and substantially all other government research and development and general and administrative expense pursuant to contract provision agency of the government and certain other customer have title to or security interest in inventory related to such contract result of advance performance based payment and progress payment we reflect those advance and payment an offset the related inventory balance for contract that we account for on percentage of completion basis using unit of delivery the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract we determine the cost of other product and supply inventory by the first in first or average cost method property plant and equipment we record property plant and equipment at cost we provide for depreciation and amortization on plant and equipment generally using accelerated method during the first half of the estimated useful life of the asset and the straight line method thereafter the estimated useful life of our plant and equipment generally range from to year for building and five to year for machinery and equipment no depreciation expense is recorded on construction in progress until such asset are placed into operation depreciation expense related to plant and equipment wa million in million in and million in we review the carrying amount of long lived asset for impairment if event or change in the fact and circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable we ass impairment by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flow of the related asset grouping to it carrying amount if an asset is determined to be impaired we recognize an impairment charge in the current period for the difference between the fair value of the asset and it carrying amount capitalized software we capitalize certain cost associated with the development or purchase of internal use software the amount capitalized are included in other noncurrent asset on our consolidated balance sheet and are amortized on straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the resulting software which range from two to six year of december and capitalized software totaled million and million net of accumulated amortization of billion and billion no amortization expense is recorded until the software is ready for it intended use amortization expense related to capitalized software wa million in million in and million in goodwill the asset and liability of acquired business are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill represents cost in excess of fair value assigned to the underlying identifiable net asset of acquired business our goodwill balance wa billion at both december and we perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired such event or change in circumstance may include significant deterioration in overall economic condition change in the business climate of our industry decline in our market capitalization operating performance indicator reorganization of our business government budget restriction or the disposal of all or portion of reporting unit our goodwill ha been allocated to and is tested for impairment at level referred to the reporting unit which is our business segment level or level below the business segment the level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires to determine whether the operation below the business segment constitute self sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly review the operating result we may use either qualitative or quantitative approach when testing reporting unit goodwill for impairment for selected reporting unit we use the qualitative approach we perform qualitative evaluation of event and circumstance impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment based on that qualitative evaluation if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying amount no further evaluation is necessary otherwise we perform quantitative impairment test we perform quantitative test for most reporting unit at least every three year however for certain reporting unit we may perform quantitative impairment test every year for the quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of reporting unit to it carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds it fair value goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess we generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using combination of discounted cash flow dcf analysis and market based valuation methodology such comparable public company trading value and value observed in recent business acquisition determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including the amount and timing of expected future cash flow long term growth rate discount rate and relevant comparable public company earnings multiple and relevant transaction multiple the cash flow employed in the dcf analysis are based on our best estimate of future sale earnings and cash flow after considering factor such general market condition government budget existing firm order expected future order contract with supplier labor agreement change in working capital long term business plan and recent operating performance the discount rate utilized in the dcf analysis are based on the respective reporting unit weighted average cost of capital which take into account the relative weight of each component of capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flow of the respective reporting unit the carrying value of each reporting unit includes the asset and liability employed in it operation goodwill and allocation of amount held at the business segment and corporate level during the fourth quarter of and we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting unit the result of our annual impairment test of goodwill indicated that no impairment existed during the fourth quarter of we realigned certain program within the rms business segment to align with change in management structure we performed goodwill impairment test prior and subsequent to the realignment and there wa no indication of goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting unit during the fourth quarter of we realigned certain program between our business segment in connection with our strategic review of our government it and technical service business part of the realignment goodwill wa reallocated between affected reporting unit on relative fair value basis we performed goodwill impairment test prior and subsequent to the realignment the result of our annual impairment test of goodwill indicated that no impairment existed intangible asset intangible asset from acquired business are recognized at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition and consist of customer program trademark customer relationship technology and other intangible asset customer program include value assigned to major program of acquired business and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationship contract technology and trademark underlying the associated program and are amortized on straight line basis over period of expected cash flow used to measure the fair value which range from nine to year acquired intangible deemed to have indefinite life are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing this testing compare carrying value to fair value and when appropriate the carrying value of these asset is reduced to fair value finite lived intangible are amortized to expense over the applicable useful life ranging from three to year based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit reflected by future net cash inflow we perform an impairment test of finite lived intangible whenever event or change in circumstance indicate their carrying value may be impaired customer advance and amount in excess of cost incurred we receive advance performance based payment and progress payment from customer that may exceed cost incurred on certain contract including contract with agency of the government we classify such advance other than those reflected reduction of receivables or inventory discussed current liability postretirement benefit plan many of our employee are covered by defined benefit pension plan and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefit to eligible retiree collectively postretirement benefit plan gaap requires that the we record related to our postretirement benefit plan be computed based on service to date using actuarial valuation that are based in part on certain key economic assumption we make including the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan asset and other actuarial assumption including participant longevity also known mortality health care cost trend rate and employee turnover each appropriate based on the nature of the plan market related value of our plan asset determined using actual asset gain or loss over the prior three year period is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gain or loss to be amortized these asset gain or loss along with those resulting from adjustment to our benefit obligation will be amortized to expense using the corridor method where gain and loss are recognized to the extent they exceed of the greater of plan asset or benefit obligation over the average future service period of employee expected to receive benefit under the plan of approximately nine year of december this amortization period is expected to extend approximately double in when our non union pension plan is frozen to use the average remaining life expectancy of the participant instead of average future service we recognize on plan by plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plan under gaap either an asset recorded within other noncurrent asset or liability recorded within noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet the gaap funded status is measured the difference between the fair value of the plan asset and the benefit obligation of the plan the funded status under the employee retirement income security act of erisa amended by the pension protection act of ppa is calculated on different basis than under gaap environmental matter we record liability for environmental matter when it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the cost to be incurred for remediation at particular site we do not discount the recorded liability the amount and timing of future cash payment are not fixed or can not be reliably determined our environmental liability are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet within other liability both current and noncurrent we expect to include substantial portion of environmental cost in our net sale and cost of sale in future period pursuant to government agreement or regulation at the time liability is recorded for future environmental cost we record receivable for estimated future recovery considered probable the pricing of product and service to agency of the government regardless of the contract form cost reimbursable fixed price we continuously evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing among other factor government regulation our government business base and contract mix our history of receiving reimbursement of such cost and recent effort by government representative to limit such reimbursement we include the portion of those environmental cost expected to be allocated to our non government contract or that is determined to not be recoverable under government contract in our cost of sale at the time the liability is established our environmental receivables are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet within other asset both current and noncurrent we project cost and recovery of cost over approximately year investment in marketable security investment in marketable security consist of debt and equity security and are classified trading security of december and the fair value of our trading security totaled billion and billion and wa included in other noncurrent asset on our consolidated balance sheet our trading security are held in separate trust which includes investment to fund our deferred compensation plan liability net gain on trading security in and were million and million net loss on trading security in were million gain and loss on these investment are included in other unallocated net within cost of sale on our consolidated statement of earnings in order to align the classification of change in the market value of investment held for the plan with change in the value of the corresponding plan liability equity method investment investment where we have the ability to exercise significant influence but do not control are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are included in other noncurrent asset on our consolidated balance sheet significant influence typically exists if we have to ownership interest in the investee under this method of accounting our share of the net earnings or loss of the investee is included in operating profit in other income net on our consolidated statement of earnings since the activity of the investee are closely aligned with the operation of the business segment holding the investment we evaluate our equity method investment for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of such investment may be impaired if decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other than temporary loss is recorded in earnings in the current period of both december and our equity method investment totaled billion which primarily are composed of our space business segment investment in united launch alliance ula see

experience performance issue which could adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation derivative financial instrument we use derivative instrument principally to reduce our exposure to market risk from change in foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate we do not enter into or hold derivative instrument for speculative trading purpose we transact business globally and are subject to risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rate we enter into foreign currency hedge such forward and option contract that change in value foreign currency exchange rate change these contract hedge forecasted foreign currency transaction in order to mitigate fluctuation in our earnings and cash flow associated with change in foreign currency exchange rate we designate foreign currency hedge cash flow hedge we also are exposed to the impact of interest rate change primarily through our borrowing activity for fixed rate borrowing we may use variable interest rate swap effectively converting fixed rate borrowing to variable rate borrowing in order to reduce the amount of interest paid these swap are designated fair value hedge for variable rate borrowing we may use fixed interest rate swap effectively converting variable rate borrowing to fixed rate borrowing in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate change on earnings these swap are designated cash flow hedge we also may enter into derivative instrument that are not designated hedge and do not qualify for hedge accounting which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposure we record derivative at their fair value the classification of gain and loss resulting from change in the fair value of derivative is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and it resulting designation adjustment to reflect change in fair value of derivative attributable to the effective portion of hedge are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustment to the hedged item or reflected net of income tax in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings change in the fair value of the derivative that are attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedge or of derivative that are not considered to be highly effective hedge if any are immediately recognized in earnings the aggregate notional amount

of our derivative are designated for hedge accounting see note fair value measurement for more information on the fair value measurement related to our derivative instrument recent accounting pronouncement revenue from contract with customersin may the financial accounting standard board fasb issued accounting standard update asu no revenue from contract with customer amended topic commonly referred to asc which will change the way we recognize revenue and significantly expand the disclosure requirement for revenue arrangement the new standard is effective for annual reporting period beginning after december we adopted the requirement of the new standard on january using the full retrospective transition method whereby asc will be applied to each prior year presented and the cumulative effect of applying asc will be recognized at january the beginning of the earliest year presented asc supersedes substantially all existing revenue guidance affecting under current gaap it will impact revenue and cost recognition across all of our business segment well our business process and our information technology system we commenced our evaluation of the impact of asc in late by evaluating it impact on selected contract at each of our business segment with this baseline understanding we developed project plan to evaluate thousand of contract across our business segment develop process and tool to dual report financial result under both current gaap and asc and ass the internal control structure in order to adopt asc on january we have periodically briefed our audit committee on our progress made towards adoption we currently recognize the majority of our revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting whereby revenue is recognized we progress on the contract for contract with significant amount of development and or requiring the delivery of minimal number of unit revenue and profit are recognized using the percentage of completion cost to cost method to measure progress for example we use this method at our aeronautics business segment for the program at our missile and fire control mfc business segment for the thaad program at our rms business segment for the littoral combat ship and aegis combat system program and at our space business segment for government satellite program for contract that to produce substantial number of similar item without significant level of development we currently record revenue and profit using the percentage of completion unit of delivery method the basis for measuring progress on the contract for example we use this method in aeronautics for the and program in mfc for tactical missile program hellfire jassm pac program and fire control program lantirn and sniper in rms for black hawk and seahawk helicopter program and in space for commercial satellite program for contract to provide service to the government revenue is generally recorded using the percentage of completion cost to cost method under asc revenue will be recognized the customer obtains control of the good and service promised in the contract performance obligation given the nature of our product and term and condition in our contract in particular those with the government including foreign military sale fm contract the customer obtains control we perform work under the contract therefore we expect to recognize revenue over time for substantially all of our contract using method similar to our current percentage of completion cost to cost method accordingly adoption of asc will primarily impact our contract where revenue is currently recognized using the percentage of completion unit of delivery method result we anticipate recognizing revenue for these contract earlier in the performance period we incur cost opposed to when unit are delivered we may also have more performance obligation in our contract under asc which may impact the timing of recording sale and operating profit including those where sale recognition is deferred pending the incurrence of cost during the third quarter of we completed our preliminary assessment of the cumulative effect of adopting asc on our december balance sheet using the full retrospective transition method the adoption resulted in decrease in inventory an increase in billed receivables contract asset unbilled receivables and contract liability customer advance and amount in excess of cost incurred to primarily reflect the impact of converting contract currently applying the unit of delivery method to the cost to cost method for recognizing revenue and profit we expect the net impact of these reclassification to increase both our current asset and current liability by approximately in addition we have completed our preliminary assessment of adopting asc on our and operating result and have presented selected recast unaudited financial data in the following table in million except per share data the impact of adopting asc on our and operating result may not be indicative of the adoption impact in future period or of our operating performance year ended december unaudited net sale profit earnings per common share basic continuing operation operation earnings per common share continuing operation operation earnings per common share operating profit includes an increase of million in and million in for the expected impact of adopting asu no compensation retirement benefit topic on january discussed below total net cash provided by operating activity and net cash used by investing and financing activity on our consolidated statement of cash flow were not impacted by the adoption of asc compensation retirement benefitsin march the fasb issued asu no compensation retirement benefit topic which change the income statement presentation of certain component of net periodic benefit cost related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan currently we record all component of net periodic benefit cost in operating profit part of cost of sale under asu no we will be required to record only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in operating profit and the non service cost component of net periodic benefit cost interest cost expected return on plan asset amortization prior service cost or credit and net actuarial gain or loss part of non operating income we adopted the requirement of asu no on january using the retrospective transition method we expect the adoption of asu no to result in an increase to consolidated operating profit of million and million for and respectively and corresponding decrease in non operating income for each year we do not expect any impact to our business segment operating profit our consolidated net earnings or cash flow result of adopting asu no intangible goodwill and otherin january the fasb issued asu no intangible goodwill and other topic which eliminates the requirement to compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill commonly referred to step from the goodwill impairment test the new standard doe not change goodwill impairment is identified we will continue to perform our quantitative and qualitative goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to it carrying amount but if we are required to recognize goodwill impairment charge under the new standard the amount of the charge will be calculated by subtracting the reporting unit fair value from it carrying amount under the prior standard if we were required to recognize goodwill impairment charge step required to calculate the implied value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of reporting unit to all of it asset and liability if that reporting unit been acquired in business combination and the amount of the charge wa calculated by subtracting the reporting unit implied fair value of goodwill from it actual goodwill balance the new standard is effective for interim and annual reporting period beginning after december with early adoption permitted and should be applied prospectively from the date of adoption we elected to adopt the new standard for future goodwill impairment test at the beginning of the third quarter of it significantly simplifies the evaluation of goodwill for impairment the impact of the new standard will depend on the outcome of future goodwill impairment test derivative and hedgingin august the fasb issued asu no derivative and hedging topic which eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness the guidance is effective for fiscal year beginning after december with early adoption permitted we do not expect significant impact to our consolidated asset and liability net earnings or cash flow result of adopting this new standard we plan to adopt the new standard january leasesin february the fasb issued asu no lease topic which requires the recognition of lease asset and lease liability on the balance sheet and disclosure of key information about leasing arrangement for both lessee and lessor the new standard is effective january for public company with early adoption permitted the new standard currently requires the application of modified retrospective approach to the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statement we are continuing to evaluate the expected impact to our consolidated financial statement and related disclosure we plan to adopt the new standard effective january note earnings per sharethe weighted average number of share outstanding used to compute earnings per common share were follows in million average common share outstanding for basic computation average dilutive effect of equity award average common share outstanding for diluted computation compute basic and diluted earnings per common share by dividing net earnings by the respective weighted average number of common share outstanding for the period

exercise of outstanding stock option based on the treasury stock method there were no significant anti dilutive equity award for the year ended december and note acquisition and divestituresacquisition of sikorsky aircraft corporationon november we completed the acquisition of sikorsky from united technology corporation utc and certain of utc subsidiary the purchase price of the acquisition wa billion net of cash acquired result of the acquisition became wholly owned subsidiary of sikorsky is global company primarily engaged in the research design development manufacture and support of military and commercial helicopter sikorsky product include military helicopter such the black hawk seahawk ch and commercial helicopter such the and the acquisition enables to extend our core business into the military and commercial rotary wing market allowing to strengthen our position in the aerospace and defense industry further this acquisition will expand our presence in commercial and international market sikorsky ha been aligned under our rms business segment to fund the billion acquisition price we utilized billion of proceeds borrowed under temporary day revolving credit facility the day facility billion of cash on hand and billion from the issuance of commercial paper in the fourth quarter of we repaid all outstanding borrowing under the day facility with the proceeds from the issuance of billion of fixed interest rate long term note in public offering the november note in the fourth quarter of we also repaid the billion in commercial paper borrowing allocation of purchase price to asset acquired and liability assumedwe accounted for the acquisition of sikorsky business combination which requires to record the asset acquired and liability assumed at fair value the amount by which the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net asset acquired is recorded goodwill the following table summarizes the fair value of the asset acquired and liability assumed at the acquisition date including the refinement described in the previous paragraph in million cash and cash equivalent current plant and asset customer noncurrent income tax identifiable asset and payable customer advance and amount in excess of cost incurred salary benefit and payroll tax other current liability customer contractual obligation other noncurrent liability total liability assumed total consideration recorded in other noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet intangible asset related to customer program were recognized for each major helicopter and aftermarket program and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationship contract technology and tradenames underlying the associated program these intangible asset will be amortized on straight line basis over weighted average useful life of approximately year the useful life is based on period of expected cash flow used to measure the fair value of each of the intangible asset customer contractual obligation represent liability on certain development program where the expected cost exceed the expected sale under contract we measured these liability based on the price to transfer the obligation to market participant at the measurement date assuming that the liability will remain outstanding in the marketplace based on the estimated net cash outflow of the developmental program plus reasonable contracting profit margin required to transfer the contract to market participant we recorded assumed liability of million these liability will be liquidated in accordance with the underlying pattern of the contractual obligation reflected by the estimated future net cash outflow incurred on the associated contract of december we recognized approximately million in sale related to customer contractual obligation of december the estimated liquidation of the customer contractual obligation is approximated follows million in million in million in million in million in and million thereafter the fair value of the asset acquired and liability assumed were determined using income market and cost valuation methodology the fair value measurement were estimated using significant input that are not observable in the market and thus represent level measurement defined in accounting standard codification asc fair value measurement the income approach wa primarily used to value the customer program and trademark intangible asset the income approach indicates value for an asset or liability based on the present value of cash flow projected to be generated over the remaining economic life of the asset or liability being measured both the amount and the duration of the cash flow are considered from market participant perspective our estimate of market participant net cash flow considered historical and projected pricing remaining developmental effort operational performance including company specific synergy aftermarket retention product life cycle material and labor pricing and other relevant customer contractual and market factor where appropriate the net cash flow are adjusted to reflect the uncertainty associated with the underlying assumption well the risk profile of the net cash flow utilized in the valuation the adjusted future cash flow are discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate projected cash flow is discounted at required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flow and the time value of money the market approach is valuation technique that us price and other relevant information generated by market transaction involving identical or comparable asset liability or group of asset and liability valuation technique consistent with the market approach often use market multiple derived from set of comparables the cost approach which estimate value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility wa used appropriate for property plant and equipment the cost to replace given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost le an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation the purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of billion of goodwill all of which is expected to be amortizable for tax purpose substantially all of the goodwill wa assigned to our rms business the goodwill recognized is attributable to expected revenue synergy generated by the integration of our product and technology with those of sikorsky cost synergy resulting from the consolidation or elimination of certain function and intangible asset that do not qualify for separate recognition such the assembled workforce of sikorsky determining the fair value of asset acquired and liability assumed requires the exercise of significant judgment including the amount and timing of expected future cash flow long term growth rate and discount rate the cash flow employed in the dcf analysis are based on our best estimate of future sale earnings and cash flow after considering factor such general market condition customer budget existing firm order expected future order contract with supplier labor agreement change in working capital long term business plan and recent operating performance use of different estimate and judgment could yield different result impact to financial resultssikorsky financial result have been included in our consolidated financial result only for the period from the november acquisition date through december result our consolidated financial result for the year ended december do not reflect full year of sikorsky result from the november acquisition date through december sikorsky generated net sale of approximately million and operating loss of approximately million inclusive of intangible amortization and adjustment required to account for the acquisition we incurred approximately million of non recoverable transaction cost associated with the sikorsky acquisition in that were expensed incurred these cost are included in other income net on our consolidated statement of earnings we also incurred approximately million in cost associated with issuing the billion november note used to repay all outstanding borrowing under the day facility used to finance the acquisition the financing cost were recorded reduction of debt and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt pro forma financial information unaudited the following table present summarized unaudited pro

supplemental pro forma financial data above ha been calculated after applying our accounting policy and adjusting the historical result of sikorsky with pro forma adjustment net of tax that assume the acquisition occurred on january significant pro forma adjustment include the recognition of additional amortization expense related to acquired intangible asset and additional interest expense related to the short term debt used to finance the acquisition these adjustment assume the application of fair value adjustment to intangible and the debt issuance occurred on january and are approximated follows amortization expense of million and interest expense of million in addition significant nonrecurring adjustment include the elimination of million pension curtailment loss net of tax recognized in and the elimination of million income tax charge related to historic earnings of foreign subsidiary recognized by sikorsky in the unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information also reflects an increase in interest expense net of tax of approximately million in the increase in interest expense is the result of assuming the november note were issued on january proceeds of the

supplemental pro forma financial information doe not reflect the realization of any expected ongoing cost or revenue synergy relating to the integration of the two company further the pro forma data should not be considered indicative of the result that would have occurred if the acquisition related financing and associated note issuance and repayment of the day facility had been consummated on

company the fact available to at the time of assessment and how we intend to respond to the proceeding or claim our assessment of these factor may change over time individual proceeding or claim progress although we can not predict the outcome of legal or other proceeding with certainty where there is at least reasonable possibility that loss may have been incurred gaap requires to disclose an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss or make statement that such an estimate can not be made we follow thorough process in which we seek to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss and only if we are unable to make such an estimate do we conclude and disclose that an estimate can not be made accordingly unless otherwise indicated below in our discussion of legal proceeding reasonably possible loss or range of loss associated with any individual legal proceeding can not be estimated legal proceedingsas result of our acquisition of sikorsky we assumed the defense of and any potential liability for two civil false claim act lawsuit pending in the district court for the eastern district of wisconsin in october the government filed complaint in intervention in the first suit which wa brought by qui tam relator mary patzer former derco aerospace derco employee in may the government filed complaint in intervention in the second suit which wa brought by qui tam peter cimma former sikorsky support service inc sssi employee in november the court consolidated the case into single action for discovery and trial the government alleges that sikorsky and two of it wholly owned subsidiary derco and sssi violated the civil false claim act the anti kickback act and the truth in negotiation act in connection with contract the navy awarded to sssi in june to support the navy and fixed wing turboprop training aircraft sssi subcontracted with derco primarily to procure and manage spare part for the training aircraft the government alleges that sssi overbilled the navy on the contract the result of derco use of prohibited cost plus percentage of cost pricing to add profit and overhead cost percentage of the price of the spare part that derco procured and then sold to sssi the government alleges that derco claim to sssi sssi claim to the navy and sssi yearly certificate of final indirect cost from through were false in addition to violation of the false claim act the government alleges violation of the anti kickback act based on monthly chargeback through which sssi billed derco for the cost of certain sssi personnel allegedly in exchange for sssi permitting pricing arrangement that wa highly favorable to derco the government also claim that sssi submitted inaccurate cost or pricing data in violation of the truth in negotiation act for sole sourced follow on bridge contract the government complaint assert common law claim for breach of contract and unjust enrichment on january the corporation filed partial motion to dismiss intended to narrow the government claim the corporation also moved to dismiss cimma party under the false claim act first to file rule which permit only the first relator to recover in pending case the government currently seek damage in these lawsuit of approximately million subject to trebling plus statutory penalty we believe that we have legal and factual defense to the government claim although we continue to evaluate our liability and exposure we do not currently believe that it is probable that we will incur material loss if contrary to our expectation the government prevails in this matter and prof damage at or near million and is successful in such damage trebled the outcome could have an adverse effect on our result of operation in the period in which liability is recognized and on our cash flow for the period in which any damage are paid on april we filed declaratory judgment action against the mta asking the district court for the southern district of new york to find that the mta is in material breach of our agreement based on the mta failure to provide access to site where work must be performed and the customer furnished equipment necessary to complete the contract the mta filed an answer and counterclaim alleging that we breached the contract and subsequently terminated the contract for alleged default the primary damage sought by the mta are the cost to complete the contract and potential re procurement cost while we are unable to estimate the cost of another contractor to complete the contract and the cost of re procurement we note that our contract with the mta had total value of million of which million wa paid to and that the mta is seeking damage of approximately million we dispute the mta allegation and are defending against additionally following an investigation our surety on performance bond related to this matter were represented by independent counsel concluded that the mta termination of the contract wa improper finally our declaratory judgment action wa later amended to include claim for monetary damage against the mta of approximately million this matter wa taken under submission by the district court in december after five week bench trial and the filing of post trial pleading by the party we continue to await decision from the district court although this matter relates to our former is business we retained the litigation when we divested is environmental matterswe are involved in proceeding and potential proceeding relating to soil sediment surface water and groundwater contamination disposal of hazardous waste and other environmental matter at several of our current or former facility and at third party site where we have been designated potentially responsible party prp substantial portion of environmental cost will be included in our net sale and cost of sale in future period pursuant to government regulation at the time liability is recorded for future environmental cost we record receivable for estimated future recovery considered probable through the pricing of product and service to agency of the government regardless of the contract form cost reimbursable fixed price we continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing among other factor government regulation our government business base and contract mix our history of receiving reimbursement of such cost and effort by some government representative to limit such reimbursement we include the portion of those environmental cost expected to be allocated to our non government contract or that is determined not to be recoverable under government contract in our cost of sale at the time the liability is established at december and the aggregate amount of liability recorded relative to environmental matter wa million and billion most of which are recorded in other noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet we have recorded receivables totaling million and million at december and most of which are recorded in other noncurrent asset on our consolidated balance sheet for the estimated future recovery of these cost we consider the recovery probable based on the factor previously mentioned we project cost and recovery of cost over approximately year remediation activity usually span many year which make estimating liability matter of judgment because of uncertainty with respect to assessing the extent of the contamination well such factor changing remediation technology and changing regulatory environmental standard there are number of former and present operating facility that we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation we perform quarterly review of the status of our environmental remediation site and the related liability and receivables additionally in our quarterly review we consider these and other factor in estimating the timing and amount of any future cost that may be required for remediation activity and record liability when it is probable that loss ha occurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the cost to be incurred for remediation at particular site we do not discount the recorded liability the amount and timing of future cash payment are not fixed or can not be reliably determined we reasonably can not determine the extent of our financial exposure in all case although loss may be probable or reasonably possible in some case it is not possible at this time to estimate the loss or reasonably possible loss or range of loss we also pursue claim for recovery of cost incurred or contribution to site cleanup cost against other prps including the government and are conducting remediation activity under various consent decree order and agreement relating to soil groundwater sediment or surface water contamination at certain site of former or current operation under agreement related to certain site in california and new york the government reimburses an amount equal to percentage specific to each site of expenditure for certain remediation activity in the government capacity prp under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla in addition to the proceeding and potential proceeding discussed above california previously established maximum level of the contaminant hexavalent chromium in drinking water of part per billion ppb recently this standard wa successfully challenged by the california manufacturer and technology association cmta for failure to conduct the required economic feasibility analysis in response to the court ruling the state water resource control board state board branch of the california environmental protection agency withdrew the hexavalent chromium standard from the published regulation leaving only the ppb standard for total chromium the state board ha indicated it will work to re establish hexavalent chromium standard if the standard for hexavalent chromium is re established at ppb or above it will not have material impact on our existing remediation cost in california further the environmental protection agency epa is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium california is also reevaluating it existing drinking water standard of ppb for perchlorate and the epa is taking step to regulate perchlorate in drinking water if substantially lower standard are adopted in either california or at the federal level for perchlorate or for hexavalent chromium we expect material increase in our estimate for environmental liability and the related asset for the portion of the increased cost that are probable of future recovery in the
