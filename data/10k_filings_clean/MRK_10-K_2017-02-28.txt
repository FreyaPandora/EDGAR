february and the company no longer ha market exclusivity in any of it marketing territory the company continues to have market exclusivity for simponi in all of it marketing territory all profit derived from merck distribution of the two product in these country are equally divided merck and competition and the health care environmentcompetitionthe market in which the company conduct it business and the pharmaceutical industry in general are highly competitive and highly regulated the company competitor include other worldwide research based pharmaceutical company smaller research company with more limited therapeutic focus generic drug manufacturer and animal health care company the company operation may be adversely affected by generic and biosimilar competition the company product mature well technological advance of competitor industry consolidation patent granted to competitor competitive combination product new product of competitor the generic availability of competitor branded product and new information from clinical trial of marketed product or post marketing surveillance in addition patent right are increasingly challenged by competitor and the outcome be highly uncertain an adverse result in patent dispute can preclude commercialization of product or negatively affect sale of existing product and could result in the payment of royalty or in the recognition of an impairment charge with respect to intangible asset associated with certain product competitive pressure have intensified pressure in the industry have grown pharmaceutical competition involves rigorous search for technological innovation and the ability to market these innovation effectively with it long standing emphasis on research and development the company is well positioned to compete in the search for technological innovation additional resource required to meet market challenge include quality control flexibility to meet customer specification an efficient distribution system and strong technical information service the company is active in acquiring and marketing product through external alliance such licensing arrangement and ha been refining it sale and marketing effort to further address of contentschanging industry condition however the introduction of new product and process by competitor may result in price reduction and product displacement even for product protected by patent for example the number of compound available to treat particular disease typically increase over time and can result in slowed sale growth or reduced sale for the company product in that therapeutic category the highly competitive animal health business is affected by several factor including regulatory and legislative issue scientific and technological advance product innovation the quality and price of the company product effective promotional effort and the frequent introduction of generic product by competitor health care environment and government regulationglobal effort toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access in the united state federal and state government for many year also have pursued method to reduce the cost of drug and vaccine for which pay for example federal law require the company to pay specified rebate for medicine reimbursed by medicaid and to provide discount for outpatient medicine purchased by certain public health service entity and hospital serving disproportionate share of low income or uninsured patient against this backdrop the united state enacted major health care reform legislation in the patient protection and affordable care act aca which began to be implemented in various insurance market reform have advanced and state and federal insurance exchange were launched in with respect to the effect of the law on the pharmaceutical industry the law increased the mandated medicaid rebate from to expanded the rebate to medicaid managed care utilization and increased the type of entity eligible for the federal drug discount program the law also requires pharmaceutical manufacturer to pay point of service discount to medicare part beneficiary when they are in the medicare part coverage gap the called donut hole approximately million million and million wa recorded by merck reduction to revenue in and respectively related to the donut hole provision also pharmaceutical manufacturer are required to pay an annual non tax deductible health care reform fee the total annual industry fee wa billion in and will increase to billion in the fee is assessed on each company in proportion to it share of prior year branded pharmaceutical sale to certain government program such medicare and medicaid the company recorded million million and million of cost within marketing and administrative expense in and respectively for the annual health care reform fee the higher expense in reflect final regulation on the annual health care reform fee issued by the internal revenue service irs on july the final irs regulation accelerated the recognition criterion for the fee obligation by one year to the year in which the underlying sale used to allocate the fee occurred rather the year in which the fee wa paid result of this change merck recorded an additional year of expense of million in in february the center for medicare medicaid service cm issued the medicaid rebate final rule that implement provision of the aca effective april the rule provides comprehensive guidance on the calculation of average manufacturer price and best price two metric utilized to determine the rebate drug manufacturer are required to pay to state medicaid program the impact of change resulting from the issuance of the rule is not material to merck at this time however the company is still awaiting guidance from cm on two aspect of the rule that were deferred for later implementation these include definition of constitutes product line extension and delay in the participation of the territory in the medicaid drug rebate program until april the company will evaluate the financial impact of these two element when they become effective is significant uncertainty about the future of the aca in particular and healthcare law in general in the united state the company is participating in the debate and monitoring any proposed change could affect it business the company is unable to predict the likelihood of change to the aca depending on the nature of any repeal and replacement of the aca such action could have material adverse effect on the company result of operation financial condition or business also during the vermont legislature passed pharmaceutical cost transparency law the law requires manufacturer identified by the vermont green mountain care board to report certain product price information to the vermont attorney general the attorney general is required to submit report to the legislature number of other state have introduced legislation of this kind and the company expects that state will continue their focus on pharmaceutical price transparency the extent to which these proposal will pas into law is unknown at this time the company also face increasing pricing pressure globally from managed care organization government agency and program that could negatively affect the company sale and profit margin in the united state these of contentsinclude practice of managed care organization federal and state exchange and institutional and governmental purchaser and ii federal law and regulation related to medicare and medicaid including the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of and the aca change to the health care system enacted part of health care reform in the united state well increased purchasing power of entity that negotiate on behalf of medicare medicaid and private sector beneficiary could result in further pricing pressure an example health care reform is contributing to an increase in the number of patient in the medicaid program under which sale of pharmaceutical product are subject to substantial rebate in addition in the effort to contain the federal deficit the pharmaceutical industry could be considered potential source of saving via legislative proposal that have been debated not enacted these type of revenue generating or cost saving proposal include additional direct price control in the medicare prescription drug program part in addition congress may consider proposal to allow under certain condition the importation of medicine from other country remains uncertain to what proposal if any may be included part of future federal budget deficit reduction proposal that would directly or indirectly affect the company in the private sector consolidation and integration among healthcare provider is major factor in the competitive marketplace for pharmaceutical product health plan and pharmacy benefit manager have been consolidating into fewer larger entity thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance private third party insurer well government increasingly employ formulary to control cost by negotiating discounted price in exchange for formulary inclusion failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for merck product or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely impact revenue in addition to formulary tier co pay differential private health insurance company and self insured employer have been raising co payment required from beneficiary particularly for branded pharmaceutical and biotechnology product private health insurance company also are increasingly imposing utilization management tool such clinical protocol requiring prior authorization for branded product if generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic product permitting access to branded medicine these utilization management tool are also used in treatment area in which the payer ha taken the position that multiple branded product are therapeutically comparable the payer market concentrate further and more drug become available in generic form pharmaceutical company may face greater pricing pressure from private third party payer in order to provide information about the company pricing practice the company recently posted on it website it first pricing action transparency report for the united state for the year the report provides the company average annual list price and net price increase across the company portfolio dating back to the report show that the company average annual net price increase after taking sale deduction such rebate discount and return into account across the human health portfolio have been in the low to mid single digit since additionally the weighted average annual discount rate ha been steadily increasing over time reflecting the competitive market for branded medicine and the impact of the aca in the company gross sale were reduced by result of rebate discount and return effort toward health care cost containment also remain intense in european country the company face competitive pricing pressure resulting from generic and biosimilar drug in addition majority of country in europe attempt to contain drug cost by engaging in reference pricing in which authority examine pre determined market for published price of drug by brand the authority then use price data from those market to set new local price for brand name drug including the company guideline for examining reference pricing are usually set in local market and can be changed pursuant to local regulation in addition in japan the pharmaceutical industry is subject to government mandated biennial price reduction of pharmaceutical product and certain vaccine which occurred in furthermore the government can order repricings for class of drug if it determines that it is appropriate under applicable rule certain market outside of the united state have also implemented other cost management strategy such health technology assessment hta which require additional data review and administrative process all of which increase the complexity timing and cost of obtaining product reimbursement and exert downward pressure on available reimbursement in the united state htas are also being used by government and private payer the company focus on emerging market ha continued government in many emerging market are also focused on constraining health care cost and have enacted price control and related measure such compulsory of contentslicenses that aim to put pressure on the price of pharmaceutical and constrain market access the company anticipates that pricing pressure and market access challenge will continue in to varying degree in the emerging market beyond pricing and market access challenge other condition in emerging market country can affect the company effort to continue to grow in these market including potential political instability significant currency fluctuation and control financial crisis limited or changing availability of funding for health care and other development that may adversely impact the business environment for the company further the company may engage third party agent to assist in operating in emerging market country which may affect it ability to realize continued growth and may also increase the company risk exposure in addressing cost containment pressure the company engages in public policy advocacy with policymakers and continues to work to demonstrate that it medicine provide value to patient and to those who pay for health care the company advocate with government policymakers to encourage long term approach to sustainable health care financing that ensures access to innovative medicine and not disproportionately target pharmaceutical source of budget saving in market with historically low rate of health care spending the company encourages those government to increase their investment and adopt market reform in order to improve their citizen access to appropriate health care including medicine operating condition have become more challenging under the global pressure of competition industry regulation and cost containment effort although no one can predict the effect of these and other factor on the company business the company continually take measure to evaluate adapt and improve the organization and it business practice to better meet customer need and belief that it is well positioned to respond to the evolving health care environment and market force the pharmaceutical industry is also subject to regulation by regional country state and local agency around the world focused on standard and process for determining drug safety and effectiveness well condition for sale or reimbursement of particular importance is the fda in the united state which administers requirement covering the testing approval safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling and marketing of prescription pharmaceutical in case the fda requirement and practice have increased the amount of time and resource necessary to develop new product and bring to market in the united state at the same time the fda ha committed to expediting the development and review of product bearing the breakthrough therapy designation which ha accelerated the regulatory review process for medicine with this designation the european union eu ha adopted directive and other legislation concerning the classification labeling advertising wholesale distribution integrity of the supply chain enhanced pharmacovigilance monitoring and approval for marketing of medicinal product for human use these provide mandatory standard throughout the eu which may be supplemented or implemented with additional regulation by the eu member state the company policy and procedure are already consistent with the substance of these directive consequently it is believed that they will not have any material effect on the company business the company belief that it will continue to be able to

similar to phase trial an adaptive phase trial design reduces timeline by eliminating activity which would be required to start separate study upon completion of phase trial if satisfactory the company submits regulatory filing with the appropriate regulatory agency around the world to have the product candidate approved for marketing there can be no assurance that compound that is the result of any particular program will obtain the regulatory approval necessary for it to be marketed vaccine development follows the same general pathway for drug preclinical testing focus on the vaccine safety and ability to elicit protective immune response immunogenicity pre marketing vaccine clinical trial are typically done in three phase initial phase clinical study are conducted in normal subject to evaluate the safety tolerability and immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate phase study are dose ranging study finally phase trial provide the necessary data on effectiveness and safety if successful the company submits regulatory filing with the appropriate regulatory agency in the united state the fda review process begin once complete nda or bla is submitted received and accepted for review by the agency within day after receipt the fda determines if the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review the fda also ass at that time whether the application will be granted of contentsa priority review or standard review pursuant to the prescription drug user fee act pdufa the fda review period target for ndas or original blas is either six month for priority review or ten month for standard review from the time the application is deemed sufficiently complete once the review timeline are determined the fda will generally act upon the application within those timeline unless major amendment ha been submitted either at the company own initiative or the fda request to the pending application if this occurs the fda may extend the review period to allow for review of the new information but by no more than three month extension to the review period are communicated to the company the fda can act on an application either by issuing an approval letter or by issuing complete response letter crl stating that the application will not be approved in it present form and describing all deficiency that the fda ha identified the company wish to pursue an application after receiving crl it can resubmit the application with information that address the question or issue identified by the fda in order to support approval resubmissions are subject to review period target which vary depending on the underlying submission type and the content of the resubmission the fda ha four program designation fast track breakthrough therapy accelerated approval and priority review to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drug to address unmet medical need in the treatment of serious or life threatening condition the fast track designation provides pharmaceutical manufacturer with opportunity for frequent interaction with fda reviewer during the product development and the ability for the manufacturer to do rolling submission of the nda bla rolling submission allows completed portion of the application to be submitted and reviewed by the fda on an ongoing basis the breakthrough therapy designation provides manufacturer with all of the feature of the fast track designation well intensive guidance on implementing an efficient development program for the product and commitment by the fda to involve senior manager and experienced staff in the review the accelerated approval designation allows the fda to approve product based on an effect on surrogate or intermediate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict product clinical benefit and generally requires the manufacturer to conduct required post approval confirmatory trial to verify the clinical benefit the priority review designation mean that the fda goal is to take action on the nda bla within six month compared to ten month under standard review in addition under the generating antibiotic incentive now act the fda may grant qualified infectious disease product qidp status to antibacterial or antifungal drug intended to treat serious or life threatening infection including those caused by antibiotic or antifungal resistant pathogen novel or emerging infectious pathogen or other qualifying pathogen qidp designation offer certain incentive for development of qualifying drug including priority review of the nda when filed eligibility for fast track designation and five year extension of applicable exclusivity provision under the food drug and cosmetic act the primary method the company us to obtain marketing authorization of pharmaceutical product in the eu is through the centralized procedure this procedure is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical product in particular those using biotechnological process and is also available for certain new chemical compound and product company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file complete set of safety data and efficacy data part of marketing authorization application maa with the ema after the ema evaluates the maa it provides recommendation to the ec and the ec then approves or denies the maa it is also possible for new chemical product to obtain marketing authorization in the eu through mutual recognition procedure in which an application is made to single member state and if the member state approves the pharmaceutical product under national procedure the applicant may submit that approval to the mutual recognition procedure of some or all other member state outside of the united state and the eu the company submits marketing application to national regulatory authority example of such are the pharmaceutical and medical device agency in japan health canada agncia nacional de vigilncia sanatria in brazil korea food and drug administration in south korea therapeutic good administration in australia and china food and drug administration each

and all such information is available in print to any stockholder who request it from the company of contentsitem risk factor investor should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this form including the following risk factor before deciding to invest in any of the company security the risk below are not the only one the company face additional risk not currently known to the company or that the company presently deems immaterial may also impair it business operation the company business financial condition result of operation or prospect could be materially adversely affected by any of these risk this form also contains forward looking statement that involve risk and uncertainty the company result could materially differ from those anticipated in these forward looking statement result of certain factor including the risk it face described below and elsewhere see cautionary factor that may affect future result below the company is dependent on it patent right and if it patent right are invalidated or circumvented it business would be adversely affected patent protection is considered in the aggregate to be of material importance to the company marketing of human health product in the united state and in most major foreign market patent covering product that it ha introduced normally provide market exclusivity which is important for the successful marketing and sale of it product the company seek patent covering each of it product in each of the market where it intends to sell the product and where meaningful patent protection is available even if the company succeeds in obtaining patent covering it product third party or government authority may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent it patent and patent application it is important for the company business to defend successfully the patent right that provide market exclusivity for it product the company is often involved in patent dispute relating to challenge to it patent or claim by third party of infringement against the company the company defends it patent both within and outside the united state including by filing claim of infringement against other party see item financial statement and supplementary data note contingency and environmental liability below in particular manufacturer of generic pharmaceutical product from time to time file abbreviated ndas with the fda seeking to market generic form of the company product prior to the expiration of relevant patent owned or licensed by the company the company normally responds by defending it patent including by filing lawsuit alleging patent infringement patent litigation and other challenge to the company patent are costly and unpredictable and may deprive the company of market exclusivity for patented product or in some case third party patent may prevent the company from marketing and selling product in particular geographic area additionally certain foreign government have indicated that compulsory license to patent may be granted in the case of national emergency or in other circumstance which could diminish or eliminate sale and profit from those region and negatively affect the company result of operation further court decision relating to other company patent potential legislation relating to patent well regulatory initiative may result in more general weakening of intellectual property protection if one or more important product lose patent protection in profitable market sale of those product are likely to decline significantly result of generic version of those product becoming available and in the case of certain product such loss could result in material non cash impairment charge the company result of operation may be adversely affected by the lost sale unless and until the company ha successfully launched commercially successful replacement product chart listing the patent protection for certain of the company marketed product and patent protection for candidate under review and phase candidate is set forth above in item business patent trademark and license the company product lose market exclusivity the company generally experience significant and rapid loss of sale from those product the company depends upon patent to provide it with exclusive marketing right for it product for some period of time loss of patent protection for one of the company product typically lead to significant and rapid loss of sale for that product lower priced generic version of that drug become available in the case of product that contribute significantly to the company sale the loss of market exclusivity can have material adverse effect on the company business cash flow result of operation financial position and prospect for example pursuant of contentsto an agreement with generic manufacturer that manufacturer launched in the united state generic version of zetia in december in addition the company will lose patent protection for vytorin in april the company expects significant and rapid loss of sale of zetia and vytorin in the united state in key product generate significant amount of the company profit and cash flow and any event that adversely affect the market for it leading product could have material and negative impact on result of operation and cash flow the company ability to generate profit and operating cash flow depends largely upon the continued profitability of the company key product such januvia janumet keytruda gardasil gardasil isentress and zepatier result of the company dependence on key product any event that adversely affect any of these product or the market for any of these product could have significant adverse impact on result of operation and cash flow these event could include loss of patent protection increased cost associated with manufacturing generic or over the counter availability of the company product or competitive product the discovery of previously unknown side effect result of post approval trial increased competition from the introduction of new more effective treatment and discontinuation or removal from the market of the product for any reason such event could have material adverse effect on the sale of any such product the company research and development effort may not succeed in developing commercially successful product and the company may not be able to acquire commercially successful product in other way in consequence the company may not be able to replace sale of successful product that have lost patent protection like other major pharmaceutical company in order to remain competitive the company must continue to launch new product each year expected decline in sale of product after the loss of market exclusivity mean that the company future success is dependent on it pipeline of new product including new product which it may develop through joint venture and product which it is able to obtain through license or acquisition to accomplish this the company commits substantial effort fund and other resource to research and development both through it own dedicated resource and through various collaboration with third party there is high rate of failure inherent in the research and development process for new drug result there is high risk that fund invested by the company in research program will not generate financial return this risk profile is compounded by the fact that this research ha long investment cycle to bring pharmaceutical compound from the discovery phase to market may take decade or more and failure can occur at any point in the process including later in the process after significant fund have been invested for description of the research and development process see item business research and development above each phase of testing is highly regulated and during each phase there is substantial risk that the company will encounter serious obstacle or will not achieve it goal therefore the company may abandon product in which it ha invested substantial amount of time and resource some of the risk encountered in the research and development process include the following pre clinical testing of new compound may yield disappointing result competing product from other manufacturer may reach the market first clinical trial of new drug may not be successful new drug may not be effective or may have harmful side effect new drug may not be approved by the regulator for it intended use it may not be possible to obtain patent for new drug payer may refuse to cover or reimburse the new product or sale of new product may be disappointing the company can not state with certainty when or whether any of it product now under development will be approved or launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compound product candidate or product or whether any product once launched will be commercially successful the company must maintain continuous flow of successful new product and successful new indication or brand extension for existing product sufficient both to cover it substantial research and development cost and to replace sale that are lost profitable product lose market exclusivity or are displaced by competing product or therapy failure to do so in the short term or long term would have material adverse effect on the company business result of operation cash flow financial position and prospect of contentsthe company success is dependent on the successful development and marketing of new product which are subject to substantial risk product that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or fail to succeed for numerous reason including the following finding of ineffectiveness superior safety or efficacy of competing product or harmful side effect in clinical or pre clinical testing failure to receive the necessary regulatory approval including delay in the approval of new product and new indication and uncertainty about the time required to obtain regulatory approval and the benefit risk standard applied by regulatory agency in determining whether to grant approval failure in certain market to obtain reimbursement commensurate with the level of innovation and clinical benefit presented by the product lack of economic feasibility due to manufacturing cost or other factor and preclusion from commercialization by the proprietary right of others in the future if certain pipeline program are cancelled or if the company belief that their commercial prospect have been reduced the company may recognize material non cash impairment charge for those program that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with acquisition failure to successfully develop and market new product in the short term or long term would have material adverse effect on the company business result of operation cash flow financial position and prospect the company product including product in development can not be marketed unless the company obtains and maintains regulatory approval the company activity including research preclinical testing clinical trial and manufacturing and marketing it product are subject to extensive regulation by numerous federal state and local governmental authority in the united state including the fda and by foreign regulatory authority including in the eu in the united state the fda is of particular importance to the company it administers requirement covering the testing approval safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling and marketing of prescription pharmaceutical in many case the fda requirement have increased the amount of time and money necessary to develop new product and bring them to market in the united state regulation outside the united state also is primarily focused on drug safety and effectiveness and in many case cost reduction the fda and foreign regulatory authority have substantial discretion to require additional testing to delay or withhold registration and marketing approval and to otherwise preclude distribution and sale of product even if the company is successful in developing new product it will not be able to market any of those product unless and until it ha obtained all required regulatory approval in each jurisdiction where it proposes to market the new product once obtained the company must maintain approval long it plan to market it new product in each jurisdiction where approval is required the company failure to obtain approval significant delay in the approval process or it failure to maintain approval in any jurisdiction will prevent it from selling the new product in that jurisdiction until approval is obtained if ever the company would not be able to realize revenue for those new product in any jurisdiction where it doe not have approval development following regulatory approval may adversely affect sale of the company product even after product reach market certain development following regulatory approval including result in post approval phase trial or other study may decrease demand for the company product including the following the review of product that are already marketed the recall or loss of marketing approval of product that are already marketed of content changing government standard or public expectation regarding safety efficacy or labeling change and greater scrutiny in advertising and promotion in the past several year clinical trial and post marketing surveillance of certain marketed drug of the company and of competitor within the industry have raised concern that have led to recall withdrawal or adverse labeling of marketed product clinical trial and post marketing surveillance of certain marketed drug also have raised concern among some prescribers and patient relating to the safety or efficacy of pharmaceutical product in general that have negatively affected the sale of such product in addition increased scrutiny of the outcome of clinical trial ha led to increased volatility in market reaction further these matter often attract litigation and even where the basis for the litigation is groundless considerable resource may be needed to respond in addition following the wake of product withdrawal and other significant safety issue health authority such the fda the ema and japan pharmaceutical and medical device agency have increased their focus on safety when assessing the benefit risk balance of drug some health authority appear to have become more cautious when making decision about approvability of new product or indication and are re reviewing select product that are already marketed adding further to the uncertainty in the regulatory process there is also greater regulatory scrutiny especially in the united state on advertising and promotion and in particular direct to consumer advertising if previously unknown side effect are discovered or if there is an increase in negative publicity regarding known side effect of any of the company product it could significantly reduce demand for the product or require the company to take action that could negatively affect sale including removing the product from the market restricting it distribution or applying for labeling change further in the current environment in which all pharmaceutical company operate the company is at risk for product liability and consumer protection claim and civil and criminal governmental action related to it product research and or marketing activity the company face intense competition from lower cost generic product in general the company face increasing competition from lower cost generic product the patent right that protect it product are of varying strength and duration in addition in some country patent protection is significantly weaker than in the united state or in the eu in the united state and the eu political pressure to reduce spending on prescription drug ha led to legislation and other measure which encourages the use of generic and biosimilar product although it is the company policy to actively protect it patent right generic challenge to the company product can arise at any time and the company patent may not prevent the emergence of generic competition for it product loss of patent protection for product typically is followed promptly by generic substitute reducing the company sale of that product availability of generic substitute for the company drug may adversely affect it result of operation and cash flow in addition proposal emerge from time to time in the united state and other country for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drug any such proposal that is enacted into law could worsen this substantial negative effect on the company sale and potentially it business cash flow result of operation financial position and prospect the company face intense competition from competitor product which in addition to other factor could in certain circumstance lead to non cash impairment charge the company product face intense competition from competitor product this competition may increase new product enter the market in such an event the competitor product may be safer or more effective more convenient to use or more effectively marketed and sold than the company product alternatively in the case of generic competition including the generic availability of competitor branded product they may be equally safe and effective product that are sold at substantially lower price than the company product result if the company fails to maintain it competitive position this could have material adverse effect on it business cash flow result of operation financial position and prospect in addition if product that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with acquisition experience difficulty in the market that negatively impact product cash flow the company may recognize material non cash impairment charge with respect to the value of those product of contentsthe company face pricing pressure with respect to it product the company face increasing pricing pressure globally and particularly in mature market from managed care organization government agency and program that could negatively affect the company sale and profit margin in the united state these include practice of managed care group and institutional and governmental purchaser ii federal law and regulation related to medicare and medicaid including the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of and the aca and iii state activity aimed at increasing price transparency change to the health care system enacted part of health care reform in the united state well increased purchasing power of entity that negotiate on behalf of medicare medicaid and private sector beneficiary could result in further pricing pressure in addition in the larger customer may in the future ask for and receive higher rebate on drug in certain highly competitive category the company must also compete to be placed on formulary of managed care organization exclusion of product from formulary can lead to reduced usage in the managed care organization in order to provide information about the company pricing practice the company recently posted on it website it first pricing action transparency report for the united state for the year the report provides the company average annual list price and net price increase across the company

the impact of the aca in the company gross sale were reduced by result of rebate discount and return outside the united state numerous major market including the eu and japan have pervasive government involvement in funding health care and in that regard fix the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and vaccine product consequently in those market the company is subject to government decision making and budgetary action with respect to it product the company expects pricing pressure to increase in the future the health care industry in the united state will continue to be subject to increasing regulation and political action the company belief that the health care industry will continue to be subject to increasing regulation well political and legal action future proposal to

two aspect of the rule that were deferred for later implementation these include definition of what constitutes product line extension and delay in the participation of the territory in the medicaid drug rebate program until april the company will evaluate the financial impact of these two element when they become effective of contentsthe company can not predict the likelihood of future change in the health care industry in general or the pharmaceutical industry in particular or what impact they may have on the company result of operation financial condition or business change in law and regulation could materially adversely affect the company business all aspect of the company business including research and development manufacturing marketing pricing sale litigation and intellectual property right are subject to extensive legislation and regulation change in applicable federal and state law and agency regulation could have material adverse effect on the company business in particular there is significant uncertainty about the future of the aca and healthcare law in general in the united state the company is participating in the debate and monitoring how any proposed change could affect it business the company is unable to predict the likelihood of change to the aca depending on the nature of any repeal and replacement of the aca such action could have material adverse effect on the company result of operation financial condition or business the uncertainty in global economic condition together with austerity measure being taken by certain government could negatively affect the company operating result the uncertainty in global economic condition may result in further slowdown to the global economy that could affect the company business by reducing the price that drug wholesaler and retailer hospital government agency and managed health care provider may be able or willing to pay for the company product or by reducing the demand for the company product which could in turn negatively impact the company sale and result in material adverse effect on the company business cash flow result of operation financial position and prospect global effort

to period of global financial instability or may have very limited resource to spend on health care in order for the company to successfully implement it emerging market strategy it must attract and retain qualified personnel the company may also be required to increase it reliance on third party agent within le developed market in addition many of these country have currency that fluctuate substantially and if such currency devalue and the company can not offset the devaluation the company financial performance within such country could be adversely affected in addition in china commercial and economic condition may adversely affect the company growth prospect in that market while the company continues to believe that china represents an important growth opportunity these event coupled with heightened scrutiny of the health care industry may continue to have an impact on product pricing and market access generally the company anticipates that the reported inquiry made by various governmental authority involving multinational pharmaceutical company in china may continue for all these reason sale within emerging market carry significant risk however failure to maintain the company presence in emerging market could have material adverse effect on the business financial condition or result of the company operation the company is exposed to market risk from fluctuation in currency exchange rate and interest rate the company operates in multiple jurisdiction and virtually all sale are denominated in currency of the local jurisdiction additionally the company ha entered and will enter into acquisition licensing borrowing or other financial transaction that may give rise to currency and interest rate exposure since the company can not with certainty foresee and mitigate against such adverse fluctuation fluctuation in currency exchange rate and interest rate could negatively affect the company result of operation financial position and cash flow occurred with respect to venezuela in and in order to mitigate against the adverse impact of these market fluctuation the company will from time to time enter into hedging agreement while hedging agreement such currency option and forward and interest rate swap may limit some of the exposure to exchange rate and interest rate fluctuation such attempt to mitigate these risk may be costly and not always successful of contentsthe company is subject to evolving and complex tax law which may result in additional liability that may affect result of operation the company is subject to evolving

animal health industry could have negative impact on future result of operation future sale of key animal health product could be adversely affected by number of risk factor including certain risk that are specific to the animal health business for example the outbreak of disease carried by animal such bovine spongiform encephalopathy or mad cow disease could lead to their widespread death and precautionary destruction well the reduced consumption and demand for animal which could adversely impact the company result of operation also the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near the company main production site could require the company to immediately halt production of vaccine at such site or force the company to incur substantial expense in procuring raw material or vaccine elsewhere other risk specific to animal health include of contentsepidemics and pandemic government procurement and pricing practice weather and global agribusiness economic event the animal health segment of the company business becomes more significant the impact of any such event on future result of operation would also become more significant biologics carry unique risk and uncertainty which could have negative impact on future result of operation the successful development testing manufacturing and commercialization of biologics particularly human and animal health vaccine is long expensive and uncertain process there are unique risk and uncertainty with biologics including there may be limited access to and supply of normal and diseased tissue sample cell line pathogen bacteria viral strain and other biological material in addition government regulation in multiple jurisdiction such the united state and the eu could result in restricted access to or transport or use of such material if the company loses access to sufficient source of such material or if tighter restriction are imposed on the use of such material the company may not be able to conduct research activity planned and may incur additional development cost the development manufacturing and marketing of biologics are subject to regulation by the fda the ema and other regulatory body these regulation are often more complex and extensive than the regulation applicable to other pharmaceutical product for example in the united state bla including both preclinical and clinical trial data and extensive data regarding the manufacturing procedure is required for human vaccine candidate and fda approval is required for the release of each manufactured commercial lot manufacturing biologics especially in large quantity is often complex and may require the use of innovative technology to handle living micro organism each lot of an approved biologic must undergo thorough testing for identity strength quality purity and potency manufacturing biologics requires facility specifically designed for and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedure are necessary slight deviation anywhere in the manufacturing process including filling labeling packaging storage and shipping and quality control and testing may result in lot failure product recall or spoilage when change are made to the manufacturing process the company may be required to provide pre clinical and clinical data showing the comparable identity strength quality purity or potency of the product before and after such change biologics are frequently costly to manufacture production ingredient are derived from living animal or plant material and most biologics can not be made synthetically in particular keeping up with the demand for vaccine may be difficult due to the complexity of producing vaccine the use of biologically derived ingredient can lead to allegation of harm including infection or allergic reaction or closure of product facility due to possible contamination any of these event could result in substantial cost product liability insurance for product may be limited cost prohibitive or unavailable result of number of factor product liability insurance ha become le available while the cost ha increased significantly with respect to product liability the company self insures substantially all of it risk the availability of commercial insurance ha become more restrictive the company ha evaluated it risk and ha determined that the cost of obtaining product liability insurance outweighs the likely benefit of the coverage that is available and such ha no insurance for certain product liability effective august

yield the largest overall potential net loss in earnings due to exchange at december the company wa in net long receivable of contentsposition relative to it major foreign currency after consideration of forward contract therefore uniform strengthening of the dollar would have reduced income before tax by approximately million this measurement assumes that change in one foreign currency relative to the dollar would not affect other foreign currency relative to the dollar although not predictive in nature the company belief that threshold reflects reasonably possible near term change in merck major foreign currency exposure relative to the dollar the cash flow from these contract are reported operating activity in the consolidated statement of cash flow since january venezuela ha been designated hyperinflationary and result local foreign operation are remeasured in dollar with the impact recorded in result of operation in the venezuelan government identified multiple exchange rate which included the cencoex rate vef per dollar and the simadi rate while the venezuelan government had indicated that essential good including food and medicine would remain at the cencoex rate during the second quarter of upon evaluation of evolving economic condition in venezuela and volatility in the country combined with decline in transaction that were settled at the cencoex rate the company determined it wa unlikely that all outstanding net monetary asset would be settled at the cencoex rate accordingly during the second quarter of the company recorded charge of million within other income expense net to devalue it net monetary asset in venezuela to an amount that represented the company estimate of the dollar amount that would ultimately be collected during the third quarter of the company recorded additional exchange loss of million in the aggregate reflecting the ongoing effect of translating transaction and net monetary asset consistent with the second quarter result of the further deterioration of economic condition in venezuela and continued decline in transaction which were settled at the cencoex rate subsequently replaced by the dipro rate in the fourth quarter of the company began using the simadi rate which wa vef per at december to report it venezuelan operation the company also revalued it remaining net monetary asset at the simadi rate subsequently replaced with the dicom rate which resulted in an additional charge in the fourth quarter of of million the company may also use forward exchange contract to hedge it net investment in foreign operation against movement in exchange rate the forward contract are designated hedge of the net investment in foreign operation the company hedge portion of the net investment in certain of it foreign operation and measure ineffectiveness based upon change in spot foreign exchange rate that are recorded in other income expense net the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on these contract is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income oci and remains in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci until either the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the subsidiary the cash flow from these contract are reported investing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flow foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency debt the company senior unsecured euro denominated note have been designated and are effective economic hedge of the net investment in foreign operation accordingly foreign currency transaction gain or loss due to spot rate fluctuation on the euro denominated debt instrument are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within oci interest rate risk managementthe company may use interest rate swap contract on certain investing and borrowing transaction to manage it net exposure to interest rate change and to reduce it overall cost of borrowing the company doe not use leveraged swap and in general doe not leverage any of it investment activity that would put principal capital at risk in may four interest rate swap with notional amount of million each matured these swap effectively converted the company billion fixed rate note due to variable rate debt at december the company wa party to pay floating receive fixed interest

value change in the note attributable to change in the benchmark london interbank offered rate libor swap rate the fair value change in the note attributable to change in the libor swap rate are recorded in interest expense and offset by the fair value change in the swap contract the cash flow from these contract are reported operating activity in the consolidated statement of cash flow the company investment portfolio includes cash equivalent and short term investment the market value of which are not significantly affected by change in interest rate the market value of the company medium to long term fixed rate investment is modestly affected by change in interest rate change in medium to long term interest rate have more significant impact on the market value of the company fixed rate borrowing which generally have longer maturity sensitivity analysis to measure potential change in the market value of merck investment and debt from change in interest rate indicated that one percentage point increase in interest rate at december and would have positively affected the net aggregate market value of these instrument by billion and billion respectively one percentage point decrease at december and would have negatively affected the net aggregate market value by billion and billion respectively the fair value of merck debt wa determined using pricing model reflecting one percentage point shift in the appropriate yield curve the fair value of merck investment were determined using combination of pricing and duration model critical accounting policiesthe company consolidated financial statement are prepared in conformity with gaap and accordingly include certain amount that are based on management best estimate and judgment estimate are used when accounting for amount recorded in connection with acquisition including initial fair value determination of asset and liability primarily ipr other intangible asset and contingent consideration well subsequent fair value measurement additionally estimate are used in determining such item provision for sale discount and return depreciable and amortizable life recoverability of inventory including those produced in preparation for product launch amount recorded for contingency environmental liability and other reserve pension and other postretirement benefit plan assumption share based compensation assumption restructuring cost impairment of long lived asset including intangible asset and goodwill and investment and tax on income because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimate actual result may differ from these estimate application of the following accounting policy result in accounting estimate having the potential for the most significant impact on the financial statement acquisitionsto determine whether acquisition qualify business combination or asset acquisition the company make certain judgment which include assessment of the input process and output associated with the acquired set of activity on october the company adopted new accounting guidance intended to clarify whether transaction should be accounted for acquisition or disposal of asset or business if the company determines that substantially all of the fair value of gross asset included in transaction is concentrated in single asset or group of similar asset the asset would not represent business to be considered business the asset in transaction need to include an input and substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output prior to the adoption of the new guidance the company would consider an acquisition or disposition business if there were input well process that when applied to those input had the ability to create output in business combination the acquisition method of accounting requires that the asset acquired and liability assumed be recorded of the date of the acquisition at their respective fair value with limited exception of contentsassets acquired and liability assumed in business combination that arise from contingency are recognized at fair value if fair value can reasonably be estimated if the acquisition date fair value of an asset acquired or liability assumed that arises from contingency can not be determined the asset or liability is recognized if probable and reasonably estimable if these criterion are not met no asset or liability is recognized fair value is defined the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participant on the measurement date accordingly the company may be required to value asset at fair value measure that do not reflect the company intended use of those asset any excess of the purchase price consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of net asset acquired is recorded goodwill transaction cost and cost to restructure the acquired company are expensed incurred the operating result of the acquired business are reflected in the company consolidated financial statement after the date of the acquisition the fair value of intangible asset including acquired ipr are determined utilizing information available near the acquisition date based on expectation and assumption that are deemed reasonable by management given the considerable judgment involved in determining fair value the company typically obtains assistance from third party valuation specialist for significant item amount allocated to acquired ipr are capitalized and accounted for indefinite lived intangible asset subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the project upon successful completion of each project merck will make separate determination to the then useful life of the asset generally determined by the period in which the substantial majority of the cash flow are expected to be generated and begin amortization certain of the company business acquisition involve the potential for future payment of consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestone including product development milestone and royalty payment on future product sale the fair value of contingent consideration liability is determined at the acquisition date using unobservable input these input include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flow the probability of success achievement of the contingent event and the risk adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability weighted cash flow subsequent to the acquisition date at each reporting period the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with change either expense or income recorded in earnings change in any of the input may result in significantly different fair value adjustment the judgment made in determining estimated fair value assigned to asset acquired and liability assumed in business combination well asset life can materially affect the company result of operation if the company determines the transaction will not be accounted for an acquisition of business the transaction will be accounted for an acquisition of asset rather than business combination and therefore no goodwill will be recorded in an asset acquisition acquired ipr with no alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date the fair value of identifiable intangible asset related to currently marketed product and product right are primarily determined by using an income approach through which fair value is estimated based on each asset discounted projected net cash flow the company estimate of market participant net cash flow consider historical and projected pricing margin and expense level the performance of competing product where applicable relevant industry and therapeutic area growth driver and factor current and expected trend in technology and product life cycle the time and investment that will be required to develop product and technology the ability to obtain marketing and regulatory approval the ability to manufacture and commercialize the product the extent and timing of potential new product introduction by the company competitor and the life of each asset underlying patent if any the net cash flow are then probability adjusted where appropriate to consider the uncertainty associated with the underlying assumption well the risk profile of the net cash flow utilized in the valuation the probability adjusted future net cash flow of each product are then discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate discount rate the fair value of identifiable intangible asset related to ipr are also determined using an income approach through which fair value is estimated based on each asset probability adjusted future net cash flow which reflect the different stage of development of each product and the associated probability of successful completion the net cash flow are then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate revenue recognitionrevenues from sale of product are recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the customer typically at time of delivery recognition of revenue also requires reasonable assurance of collection of sale proceeds and of contentscompletion of all performance obligation domestically sale discount are issued to customer direct discount at the point of sale indirectly through an intermediary wholesaler known chargebacks or indirectly in the form of rebate additionally sale are generally made with limited right of return under certain condition revenue are recorded net of provision for sale discount and return which are established at the time of sale in addition revenue are recorded net of time value of money discount for customer for which collection of account receivable is expected to be in excess of one year the provision for aggregate indirect customer discount cover chargebacks and rebate chargebacks are discount that occur when contracted customer purchase directly through an intermediary wholesaler the contracted customer generally purchase product at it contracted price plus mark up from the wholesaler the wholesaler in turn charge the company back for the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contract price paid to the wholesaler by the customer the provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell through level by the company wholesale customer to contracted customer well estimated wholesaler inventory level rebate are amount owed based upon definitive contractual agreement or legal requirement with private sector and public sector medicaid and medicare part benefit provider after the final dispensing of the product by pharmacy to benefit plan participant the provision is based on expected payment which are driven by patient usage and contract performance by the benefit provider customer the company us historical customer segment mix adjusted for other known event in order to estimate the expected provision amount accrued for aggregate indirect customer discount are evaluated on quarterly basis through comparison of information provided by the wholesaler health maintenance organization pharmacy benefit manager and other customer to the amount accrued adjustment are recorded when trend or significant event indicate that change in the estimated provision is appropriate the company continually monitor it provision for aggregate indirect customer discount there were no material adjustment to estimate associated with the aggregate indirect customer discount provision in or summarized information about change in the aggregate indirect customer discount accrual related to sale is follows in million january to prior year payment balance december for chargebacks are reflected direct reduction to account receivable and accrual for rebate current liability the accrued balance relative to these provision included in account receivable and accrued and other current liability were million and billion respectively at december and were million and billion respectively at december the company maintains return policy that allows it pharmaceutical customer to return product within specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date generally three to six month before and month after product expiration the estimate of the provision for return is based upon historical experience with actual return additionally the company considers factor such level of inventory in the distribution channel product dating and expiration period whether product have been discontinued entrance in the market of additional generic competition change in formulary or launch of over the counter product among others the product return provision for pharmaceutical sale percentage of net pharmaceutical sale wa in in and in through it distribution program with wholesaler the company encourages wholesaler to align purchase with underlying demand and maintain inventory below specified level the term of the program allow the wholesaler to earn fee upon providing visibility into their inventory level well by achieving certain performance parameter such inventory management customer service level reducing shortage claim and reducing product return information provided through the wholesaler distribution program includes item such sale trend inventory on hand on order quantity and product return of contentswholesalers generally provide only the above mentioned data to the company there is no regulatory requirement to report lot level information to manufacturer which is the level of information needed to determine the remaining shelf life and original sale date of inventory given current wholesaler inventory level which are generally le than month the company belief that collection of order lot information across all wholesale customer would have limited use in estimating sale discount and return inventory produced in preparation for product launchesthe company capitalizes inventory produced in preparation for product launch sufficient to support estimated initial market demand typically capitalization of such inventory doe not begin until the related product candidate are in phase clinical trial and are considered to have high probability of regulatory approval the company monitor the status of each respective product within the regulatory approval process however the company generally doe not disclose specific timing for regulatory approval if the company is aware of any specific risk or contingency other than the normal regulatory approval process or if there are any specific issue identified during the research process relating to safety efficacy manufacturing marketing or labeling the related inventory would generally not be capitalized expiry date of the inventory are affected by the stage of completion the company manages the level of inventory at each stage to optimize the shelf life of the inventory in relation to anticipated market demand in order to avoid product expiry issue for inventory that are capitalized anticipated future sale and shelf life support the realization of the inventory value the inventory shelf life is sufficient to meet initial product launch requirement inventory produced in preparation for product launch capitalized at december and were million and million respectively contingency and environmental liabilitiesthe company is involved in various claim and legal proceeding of nature considered normal to it business including product liability intellectual property and commercial litigation well certain additional matter see note to the consolidated financial statement the company record accrual for contingency when it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated these accrual are adjusted periodically assessment change or additional information becomes available for product liability claim portion of the overall accrual is actuarially determined and considers such factor past experience number of claim reported and estimate of claim incurred but not yet reported individually significant contingent loss are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable legal defense cost expected to be incurred in connection with loss contingency are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable some of the significant factor considered in the review of these legal defense reserve are follows the actual cost incurred by the company the development of the company legal defense strategy and structure in light of the scope of it litigation the number of case being brought against the company the cost and outcome of completed trial and the most current information regarding anticipated timing progression and related cost of pre trial activity and trial in the associated litigation the amount of legal defense reserve of december and of approximately million and million respectively represents the company best estimate of the minimum amount of defense cost to be incurred in connection with it outstanding litigation however event such additional trial and other event that could arise in the course of it litigation could affect the ultimate amount of legal defense cost to be incurred by the company the company will continue to monitor it legal defense cost and review the adequacy of the associated reserve and may determine to increase the reserve at any time in the future if based upon the factor set forth it belief it would be appropriate to do so the company and it subsidiary are party to number of proceeding brought under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known superfund and other federal and state equivalent when legitimate claim for contribution is asserted liability is initially accrued based upon the estimated transaction cost to manage the site accrual are adjusted site investigation feasibility study and related cost assessment of remedial technique are completed and the extent to which other potentially responsible party who may be jointly and severally liable can be expected to contribute is determined the company is also remediating environmental contamination resulting from past industrial activity at certain of it site and take an active role in identifying and accruing for these cost in the past merck performed worldwide survey to ass all site for potential contamination resulting from past industrial activity where assessment indicated that physical investigation wa warranted such investigation wa performed providing better evaluation of the need for remedial action where such need wa identified remedial action wa then initiated of contentsdefinitive information became available during the course of investigation and or remedial effort at each site estimate were refined and accrual were established or adjusted accordingly these estimate and related accrual continue to be refined annually the company belief that there are no compliance issue associated with applicable environmental law and regulation that would have material adverse effect on the company expenditure for remediation and environmental liability were million in and are estimated at million in the aggregate for the year through in management opinion the liability for all environmental matter that are probable and reasonably estimable have been accrued and totaled million and million at december and respectively these liability are undiscounted do not consider potential recovery from other party and will be paid out over the period of remediation for the applicable site which are expected to occur primarily over the next year although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matter or the ultimate cost of remediation management doe not believe that any reasonably possible expenditure that may be incurred in excess of the liability accrued should exceed million in the aggregate management also doe not believe that these expenditure should result in material adverse effect on the company financial position result of operation liquidity or capital resource for any year share based compensationthe company expense all share based payment award to employee including grant of stock option over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the award the company determines the fair value of certain share based award using the black scholes option pricing model which us both historical and current market data to estimate the fair value this method incorporates various assumption such the risk free interest rate expected volatility expected dividend yield and expected life of the option total pretax share based compensation expense wa million in million in and million in at december there wa million of total pretax unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock option restricted stock unit and performance share unit award which will be recognized over weighted average period of year for segment reporting share based compensation cost are unallocated expense pension and other postretirement benefit plansnet periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit plan totaled million in million in and million in pension and other postretirement benefit plan information for financial reporting purpose is calculated using actuarial assumption including discount rate for plan benefit obligation and an expected rate of return on plan asset the change in net periodic benefit cost year over year for pension plan are largely attributable to change in the discount rate affecting net amortization the decrease in net periodic benefit cost for other postretirement benefit plan in compared with is largely attributable to change in retiree medical benefit approved by the company in december the company reassesses it benefit plan assumption on regular basis for both the pension and other postretirement benefit plan the discount rate is evaluated on measurement date and modified to reflect the prevailing market rate of portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instrument that would provide the future cash flow needed to pay the benefit included in the benefit obligation they come due the discount rate for the company pension and other postretirement benefit plan ranged from to at december compared with range of to at december the expected rate of return for both the pension and other postretirement benefit plan represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan asset over the period the benefit included in the benefit obligation are to be paid in developing the expected rate of return the company considers long term compound annualized return of historical market data well actual return on the company plan asset using this reference information the company develops forward looking return expectation for each asset category and weighted average expected long term rate of return for target portfolio allocated across these investment category the expected portfolio performance reflects the contribution of active management appropriate for the expected rate of return for the company pension and other postretirement benefit plan will range from to compared to range of to in the company ha established investment guideline for it pension and other postretirement plan to create an asset allocation that is expected to deliver rate of return sufficient to meet the long term obligation of each plan given an acceptable level of risk the target investment portfolio of the company pension and other of contentspostretirement benefit plan is allocated to in equity to in international equity to in fixed income investment and up to in cash and other investment the portfolio equity weighting is consistent with the long term nature of the plan benefit obligation the expected annual standard deviation of return of the target portfolio which approximates reflects both the equity allocation and the diversification benefit among the asset class in which the portfolio invests for non pension plan the targeted investment portfolio varies based on the duration of pension liability and local government rule and regulation although significant percentage of plan asset are invested in equity concentration risk is mitigated through the use of strategy that are diversified within management guideline actuarial assumption are based upon management best estimate and judgment reasonably possible change of plus minus basis point in the discount rate assumption with other assumption held constant would have an estimated million favorable unfavorable impact on the company current year net periodic benefit cost reasonably possible change of plus minus basis point in the expected rate of return assumption with other assumption held constant would have an estimated million favorable unfavorable impact on merck current year net periodic benefit cost required funding obligation for relating to the company pension and other postretirement benefit plan are not expected to be material the preceding hypothetical change in the discount rate and expected rate of return assumption would not impact the company funding requirement net loss amount which reflect experience differential primarily relating to difference between expected and actual return on plan asset well the effect of change in actuarial assumption are recorded component of aoci expected return for pension plan are based on calculated market related value of asset under this methodology asset gain loss resulting from actual return that differ from the company expected return are recognized in the market related value of asset ratably over five year period also net loss amount in aoci in excess of certain threshold are amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service life of employee restructuring costsrestructuring cost have been recorded in connection with restructuring program designed to streamline the company cost structure result the company ha made estimate and judgment regarding it future plan including future termination benefit and other exit cost to be incurred when the restructuring action take place when accruing these cost the company will recognize the amount within range of cost that is the best estimate within the range when no amount within the range is better estimate than any other amount the company recognizes the minimum amount within the range in connection with these action management also ass the recoverability of long lived asset employed in the business in certain instance asset life have been shortened based on change in the expected useful life of the affected asset severance and other related cost are reflected within restructuring cost asset related charge are reflected within material and production cost marketing and administrative expense and research and development expense depending upon the nature of the asset impairment of long lived assetsthe company ass change in economic regulatory and legal condition and make assumption regarding estimated future cash flow in evaluating the value of the company property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible asset the company periodically evaluates whether current fact or circumstance indicate that the carrying value of it long lived asset to be held and used may not be recoverable if such circumstance are determined to exist an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flow of these asset or appropriate asset grouping is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists if the asset is determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset fair value and it carrying value if quoted market price are not available the company will estimate fair value using discounted value of estimated future cash flow approach goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net asset of business acquired and is assigned to reporting unit the company test it goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicator exist by first assessing qualitative factor to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount some of the factor considered in the assessment include general macroeconomic condition condition specific to the industry and market cost factor which could have significant effect on earnings or cash flow the overall financial performance of the reporting unit and whether there have been sustained decline in the company share price additionally the company evaluates of contentsthe extent to which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit at the last date valuation wa performed if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount quantitative fair value test is performed other acquired intangible asset excluding ipr are recorded at fair value assigned an estimated useful life and are amortized primarily on straight line basis over their estimated useful life when event or circumstance warrant review the company will ass recoverability from future operation using pretax undiscounted cash flow derived from the lowest appropriate asset grouping impairment are recognized in operating result to the extent that the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds it fair value which is determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flow ipr that the company acquires through business combination represents the fair value assigned to incomplete research project which at the time of acquisition have not reached technological feasibility the amount are capitalized and accounted for indefinite lived intangible asset subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the project the company test ipr for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicator exist by first assessing qualitative factor to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the ipr intangible asset is le than it carrying amount if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is le than the carrying amount quantitative test that compare the fair value of the ipr intangible asset with it carrying value is performed for impairment testing purpose the company may combine separately recorded ipr intangible asset into one unit of account based on the relevant fact and circumstance generally the company will combine ipr intangible asset for testing purpose if they operate single asset and are essentially inseparable if the fair value is le than the carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized within the company operating result the judgment made in evaluating impairment of long lived intangible can materially affect the company result of operation impairment of investmentsthe company review it investment for impairment based on the determination of whether the decline in market value of the investment below the carrying value is other than temporary the company considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of it investment including the duration and extent to which fair value is le than cost and for equity security the company ability and intent to hold the investment for debt security an other than temporary impairment ha occurred if the company doe not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security if the company doe not intend to sell the impaired debt security and it is not more likely than not it will be required to sell the debt security before the recovery of it amortized cost basis the amount of the other than temporary impairment recognized in earnings is limited to the portion attributed to credit loss the remaining portion of the other than temporary impairment related to other factor is recognized in oci tax on incomethe company effective tax rate is based on pretax income statutory tax rate and tax planning opportunity available in the various jurisdiction in which the company operates an estimated effective tax rate for year is applied to the company quarterly operating result in the event that there is significant unusual or one time item recognized or expected to be recognized in the company quarterly operating result the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time the unusual or one time item the company considers the resolution of prior year tax matter to be such item significant judgment is required in determining the company tax provision and in evaluating it tax position the recognition and measurement of tax position is based on management best judgment given the fact circumstance and information available at the reporting date the company evaluates tax position to determine whether the benefit of tax position are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merit of the tax position for tax position that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit the company recognizes the largest amount of the benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statement for tax position that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit the company doe not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financial statement if the more likely than not threshold is not met in the period for which tax position is taken the company may subsequently recognize the benefit of that tax position if the tax matter is effectively settled the statute of limitation expires or if the more likely than not threshold is met in subsequent period see note to the consolidated financial statement of contentstax regulation require item to be included in the tax return at different time than the item are reflected in the financial statement timing difference create deferred tax asset and liability deferred tax asset generally represent item that can be used tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future year for which the company ha already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statement the company establishes valuation allowance for it deferred tax asset when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit deferred tax liability generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statement for which payment ha been deferred or expense for which the company ha already taken deduction on the tax return but ha not yet recognized expense in the financial statement at

of at the site in each case the government alleges that the defendant are jointly and severally liable for the cleanup cost although joint and several liability is alleged these proceeding are frequently resolved so that the allocation of cleanup cost among the party more nearly reflects the relative contribution of the party to the site situation the company potential liability varies greatly from site to site for some site the potential liability is de minimis and for others the final cost of cleanup have not yet been determined while it is not feasible to predict the outcome of
