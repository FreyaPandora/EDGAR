the manufacture of our product the raw material are primarily composed of steel aluminum resin copper lead and platinum group metal we have not experienced any significant shortage of raw material and normally do not carry substantial inventory of such raw material in excess of level reasonably required to meet our production requirement in some instance we purchase system component part and supply from single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruption the inability or unwillingness of these source to supply with part and supply could have material adverse effect on our production capacity total purchase from our two largest supplier have ranged from approximately to of our total purchase from to environmental and regulatory mattersautomotive emission controlwe are subject to law and regulation that require to control automotive emission including vehicle exhaust emission standard vehicle evaporative emission standard and onboard diagnostic obd system requirement advanced obd system are used to identify and diagnose problem with emission control system problem detected by the obd system may increase warranty cost and the chance for recall emission and obd requirement become more challenging each year vehicle must meet lower emission standard and new diagnostics are required and will continue to become even more stringent throughout the world and canadathe federal government imposes stringent emission control requirement on vehicle sold in the and additional requirement are imposed by various state government canada federal government vehicle criterion emission requirement are generally aligned with the federal requirement these requirement include vehicle exhaust emission standard vehicle evaporative emission standard and obd system requirement each model year we must obtain certification for each test group that our vehicle will meet emission requirement from the environmental protection agency epa we can sell vehicle in the and canada and from the california air resource board carb before we can sell vehicle in california and other state that have adopted the california emission requirement of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiarieswhile we believe all our product are in compliance with epa and carb certification requirement both agency have ongoing in use evaluation of compliance for product from all manufacturer is possible that we or either agency could identify potential non compliance which could lead to some type of field action to remedy the issue testing includes pre production testing of vehicle part of certification and in use testing of customer vehicle at specified mileage carb ha adopted it next round of emission requirement which phase in with the model year these requirement include more stringent exhaust emission and evaporative emission standard including an increase in zero emission vehicle zev such electric vehicle or hydrogen fuel cell vehicle carb ha adopted model year and later requirement for increasing volume of zevs to achieve greenhouse gas well criterion pollutant emission reduction to help achieve the state long term greenhouse gas reduction goal the epa ha adopted similar exhaust emission and evaporative emission standard which phase in with the model year these new requirement will also increase the time and mileage period which manufacturer are responsible for vehicle emission performance the clean air act permit state that have area with air quality compliance issue to adopt the california car and light duty truck emission standard in lieu of the federal requirement thirteen state currently have these standard in effect and of these state have adopted the zev requirement europe emission are regulated by two different entity the european commission ec and the united nation economic commission for europe unece the ec imposes harmonized emission control requirement on vehicle sold in all european union eu member state and other country apply regulation under the framework of the unece we must demonstrate that vehicle will meet emission requirement from an approval authority before we can sell vehicle in the eu member state the regulatory requirement include random testing of newly assembled vehicle and manufacturer in use surveillance program eu and unece requirement are equivalent in term of stringency and implementation new level of exhaust emission standard for car and light duty truck euro wa effective in future european emission standard focus particularly on reducing emission from diesel vehicle the euro emission level will become effective in the new requirement will require additional technology and further increase the cost of diesel engine which currently cost more than gasoline engine to comply with euro standard we expect that we will need to implement technology identical to those developed to meet emission standard these technology will put additional cost pressure on the already challenging european market for small and mid size diesel vehicle gasoline engine are also affected by the new requirement the measure for gasoline vehicle that require technology to reduce exhaust pollutant emission will have adverse effect on vehicle fuel economy which drive additional technology cost to maintain fuel economy in the long term notwithstanding the already low vehicle emission in europe the ec will continue devising regulatory requirement on the emission test cycle real driving emission low temperature testing fuel evaporation and obd we are currently in compliance with all material

and others pursuing similar technology and other competing technology will not acquire similar or superior technology sooner than we do or on an exclusive basis or at significant price advantage our profitability is dependent upon the success of our higher margin vehicle and luxury brand while we offer balanced and complete portfolio of small mid size and large car cross over sport utility vehicle suv and truck we generally recognize higher profit margin on our full size pick up truck and suv our success is dependent upon consumer preference and our ability to market our higher margin vehicle of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesour future competitiveness and ability to achieve long term profitability depends on our ability to control our cost which requires to successfully implement restructuring initiative throughout our automotive operation we are continuing to implement number of cost reduction and productivity improvement initiative in our automotive operation including labor modification and substantial restructuring initiative our future competitiveness depends upon our continued success in implementing these initiative throughout our automotive operation while some of the element of cost reduction are within our control others such interest rate or return on investment which influence our expense for pension depend more on external factor and there can be no assurance that such external factor will not materially adversely affect our ability to reduce our cost reducing cost may prove difficult due to our focus on increasing advertising and our belief that engineering expense necessary to improve the performance safety and customer satisfaction of our vehicle are likely to increase any disruption in our supplier operation could disrupt our production schedule our automotive operation are dependent upon the continued ability of our supplier to deliver the system component raw material and part that we need to manufacture our product our use of in time manufacturing process allows to maintain minimal inventory quantity of system component raw material and part result our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our supplier delivering sufficient quantity of system component raw material and part on time to meet our production schedule in some instance we purchase system component raw material and part from single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruption where we experience supply disruption we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of system component raw material or part even for relatively short period of time could cause to alter production schedule or suspend production entirely an increase in cost of raw material could materially harm our business we use various raw material in our business including steel aluminum copper platinum and palladium the price for these raw material fluctuate depending on market condition in recent year freight charge and raw material cost increased substantial increase in the price for our raw material could reduce our profitability if we can not recoup the increased cost through increased vehicle price some of these raw material such corrosion resistant steel are only available from limited number of supplier we can not guarantee that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangement and relationship with these supplier an increase in the cost or sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of some of these raw material which may be caused by deterioration of our relationship with supplier or by event such labor strike could negatively affect our net revenue and profitability to material extent we operate in highly competitive industry that ha excess manufacturing capacity and attempt by our competitor to sell more vehicle could have significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating result the global automotive industry is highly competitive and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry exceeds demand many manufacturer have relatively high fixed labor cost well significant limitation on their ability to close facility and reduce fixed cost our competitor may respond to these relatively high fixed cost by attempting to sell more vehicle by adding vehicle enhancement providing subsidized financing or leasing program offering marketing incentive or reducing vehicle price manufacturer in lower cost country such china and india have emerged competitor in key emerging market and announced their intention of exporting their product to established market bargain alternative to entry level automobile these action have had and are expected to continue to have significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating result and present significant risk to our ability to enhance our revenue per vehicle our competitor may be able to benefit from the cost saving offered by industry consolidation or alliance designing manufacturing and selling vehicle is capital intensive and requires substantial investment in manufacturing machinery research and development product design engineering technology and marketing in order to meet both consumer preference and regulatory requirement large original equipment manufacturer are able to benefit from economy of scale by leveraging their investment and activity on global basis across brand and nameplate if our competitor consolidate or enter into other strategic agreement such alliance they may be able to take better advantage of these economy of scale to enhance their competitiveness or liquidity position our business plan contemplates that we restructure our operation in various european country but we may not succeed in of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiarieswe face difficult market and operating condition in certain part of the world that may require to restructure impair or rationalize these operation in many country across our region we have experienced challenge in our operation and continue to strategically ass the manner in which we operate in certain country we continue to ass our performance throughout the region additional restructuring impairment and rationalization action may be required and may be material the key area of our plan include investment in our product portfolio revised brand strategy and reducing material development and production cost the success of our plan will depend on combination of our ability to execute the action contemplated well external economic factor which are outside of our control we could be materially adversely affected by negative outcome in unusual or significant litigation governmental investigation or other legal proceeding related to the ignition switch recall we are subject to legal proceeding involving various issue including product liability lawsuit stockholder litigation and governmental investigation including class action related to the ignition switch recall such lawsuit for the alleged diminished value of vehicle affected by the ignition switch recall refer to the gm north america section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation md for additional information on the ignition switch recall at this point we are unable to predict the duration scope development in result of or consequence of the government investigation such lawsuit and investigation could in the future result in the imposition of damage substantial fine civil lawsuit and criminal penalty interruption of business modification of business practice equitable remedy and other sanction or our personnel well significant legal and other cost because the matter are ongoing there can be no assurance to the resulting consequence if any may impact our business reputation consolidated financial condition result of operation or cash flow we can not currently estimate the potential liability damage or range of potential loss result of the legal proceeding and governmental investigation for further discussion of these matter refer to note to our consolidated financial statement the cost and effect on our reputation of product recall could materially adversely affect our business from time to time we recall our product to address performance compliance or safety related issue the cost we incur in connection with these recall typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part in addition product recall can harm our reputation and cause to lose customer particularly if those recall cause consumer to question the safety or reliability of our product conversely not issuing recall or not issuing recall on timely basis can harm our reputation and cause to lose customer for the same reason expressed above we are subject to extensive governmental law regulation and policy including safety fuel economy and greenhouse gas emission the enforcement of which or change to existing one may have significant effect on how we do business we are affected significantly by governmental regulation that can increase cost related to the production of our vehicle and affect our product portfolio we anticipate that the number and extent of these regulation and the related cost and change to our product lineup will increase significantly in the future these government regulatory requirement could significantly affect our plan for global product development and may result in substantial cost including civil or criminal penalty they may also result in limit on the type of vehicle we sell and where we sell which can affect revenue in the automotive safety standard are regulated by the nhtsa whose regulator require that automotive manufacturer implement safety measure such recall for vehicle that do not or may not comply with relevant safety standard due to these regulation we could be subject to civil or criminal penalty or may incur various cost including significant cost for free repair if we are required to or voluntarily decide to implement safety measure such recall for example we are currently facing attorney for the southern district of new york congressional sec transport canada and state investigation related to the ignition switch recall in the vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emission are regulated under harmonized national program administered by the nhtsa and the epa we are committed to meeting or exceeding these regulatory requirement we expect that to comply with these requirement we will be required to sell significant volume of hybrid electric vehicle well implement new technology for conventional internal combustion engine all at increased cost level there is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicle that use such technology on profitable basis or that our customer will purchase such vehicle in the quantity necessary for to comply with these regulatory program of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesif we are not able to comply with specific new requirement we could be subject to sizeable civil penalty or have to restrict product offering drastically to remain in compliance environmental liability for which we may be responsible are not reasonably estimable and could be substantial violation of safety or emission standard could result in the recall of one or more of our product negotiated remedial action possible fine or combination of any of those item we must also cover the cost of repair conducted under emission defect and performance warranty which apply for specified period of time and mileage in turn any of these action could have substantial adverse effect on our operation including facility idling reduced employment increased cost and loss of revenue our defined benefit pension plan are currently underfunded and our pension funding requirement could

due to the complexity and magnitude of our investment example include implementation of significant change in investment policy insufficient market liquidity in particular asset class and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and long term investment our future funding requirement for our defined benefit pension plan qualified with the internal revenue service irs depend upon the future performance of asset placed in trust for these plan the level of interest rate used to determine funding level the level of benefit provided for by the plan and any change in government law and

this decrease we had strong financial result in excluding the impact of recall campaign and courtesy transportation charge performance of gmna met our expectation while gme and gmio outperformed our expectation however we experienced weaker performance in gmsa due to the challenging environment in venezuela brazil and argentina more fully described in the gm north america section of md we recorded charge of approximately billion in automotive cost of sale relating to recall campaign and courtesy transportation in the year ended december of which over wa recorded in gmna in the three month ended june we announced the creation of compensation program the program to compensate accident victim who died or suffered physical injury or their family result of faulty ignition switch related to the million vehicle recalled under the ignition switch recall refer to the gm north america section of md for additional information on the ignition switch recall it is important to our company that we reach everyone through this program who ha been impacted the program is being administered by an independent program administrator the independent administrator ha established protocol that defines the eligibility requirement to participate in the program there is no cap on the amount of payment that can be made to claimant under the program in the three month ended june we recorded billion in automotive selling general and administrative expense in corporate which represents our best estimate of amount that may be paid under the program the amount wa treated an adjustment for ebit adjusted reporting purpose however it is reasonably possible that the liability could exceed our recorded amount by approximately billion the most significant estimate affecting the amount recorded include the number of participant that have eligible claim related to death and physical injury which also contemplates the severity of injury the length of hospital stay and related compensation amount and the number of people who actually elect to participate in the program our estimate is subject to significant uncertainty program of this nature are highly unusual and each eligible claim will have unique underlying fact pattern while we do not anticipate material change to our current estimate it is possible that material change could occur if actual eligible claim and the related compensation amount differ from this estimate the program accepted claim from august through january payment to eligible claimant began in the fourth quarter and will continue through the first half of accident victim or their family could choose not to participate in the program and pursue litigation against at january the program ha received claim and the independent program administrator ha determined claim to be eligible for payment under the program remaining claim are either under review deficient awaiting further documentation or deemed ineligible based on currently available information we believe our accrual at december is adequate to cover the estimated cost under the program at january we have paid million to eligible claimant under the program accident victim that accept payment under the program agree to settle all claim against gm related to the accident we analyze the result of our automotive business through our four geographically based segment gmnaautomotive industry volume ha continued to grow in north america in industry light vehicle sale for the calendar year were million unit up from million unit in in january we announced that we

contributing to the record atp our incentive spending percentage of atp increased by percentage point while industry spending increased by percentage point compared to the prior year the first delivery of the new chevrolet colorado and gmc canyon mid size pick ups occurred in september we have announced plan to add third shift at our wentzville mo assembly plant in early to meet expected demand for both mid size pick ups and full size van customer safety and satisfaction were the major reason for the recall of approximately million vehicle announced during these recall included approximately million vehicle to repair ignition switch that could result in loss of electrical power under certain circumstance that may prevent front airbags from deploying in the event of crash accident victim who died or suffered physical injury associated with these vehicle or their family may be eligible to participate in compensation program more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statement and to fix ignition lock cylinder that could allow removal of the ignition key while the engine is running leading to possible rollaway or crash approximately million vehicle to replace either the power steering motor the steering column the power steering motor control unit or combination of the steering column and the power steering motor control unit the electric power steering could fail under certain circumstance approximately million vehicle prone to non deployment of the side impact restraint if vehicle are not serviced when the service air bag warning light is illuminated approximately million vehicle to modify the brake lamp wiring harness that could have corrosion develop due to micro vibration approximately million vehicle to replace front safety lap belt cable that could fatigue and separate over time approximately million vehicle to replace the shift cable that could wear out over time resulting in mismatch of the gear position indicated by the shift lever approximately million vehicle to rework or replace ignition key because the ignition switch may move out of the run position which may impact power steering and power braking and depending on timing of the key movement relative to the activation of the sensing algorithm of crash event may result in airbags not deploying approximately million vehicle to repair loose battery cable that could impact vehicle warning system approximately million vehicle to repair ignition mechanism where the ignition key could be pulled out while the vehicle is in the run position approximately million vehicle to replace the wave plate in all vehicle with and transmission which could crack under certain circumstance and approximately million vehicle for other matter in the three and six month ended june we recorded charge of approximately billion and billion primarily for the estimated cost of part and labor to repair these vehicle and for courtesy transportation the cost of the vehicle recalled in the six month ended december were comprehended in the june catch up adjustment of billion associated with change in estimate for previously sold vehicle refer to note and note to our consolidated financial statement for more detail related to the catch up adjustment total net sale and revenue for gmna have increased for the year ended december compared to prior year by it is difficult to determine the impact if any on current or future net sale and revenue due to our recent recall activity of the approximately million vehicle subject to recall approximately of the vehicle and of the cost involve vehicle we no longer produce or sell we began repairing vehicle in early april and we have produced sufficient part to have the ability to repair all vehicle impacted by the ignition switch recall refer to the gm north america section of md for additional information on all of the recall we announced in in the year ending december we expect an increase in ebit adjusted and ebit adjusted margin due primarily to slight increase in industry vehicle sale and full year production of full size suv partially offset by increased engineering and marketing cost the uaw contract we entered into in september expires in september gmethe automotive industry condition in europe remain challenging due to economic uncertainty resulting from weak gross domestic growth high unemployment and vehicle production overcapacity despite such condition automotive industry sale to retail and fleet customer began to improve in the three month ended december compared to the corresponding period in this trend continued in with industry sale to retail and fleet customer of million vehicle representing increase compared to the corresponding period in our european operation are benefiting from this trend and continue to show sign of improvement underscored by further improvement in our opel and vauxhall market share in the year ended december which build on our first market share increase in year in this market share increase wa partially driven by the success of the recently launched opel mokka we continue to implement various strategic action to strengthen our operation and increase our competitiveness the key action include investment in our product portfolio including the next generation opel astra and corsa revised brand strategy of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesand reducing material development and production cost including restructuring activity the success of these action will depend on combination of our ability to execute and external factor which are outside of our control we continue to ass additional strategic action across the region result of significant volume pricing and foreign exchange pressure in certain market which may result in additional restructuring or rationalization action these action if implemented may result in impairment and other charge the determination of the amount of these charge is subject to significant uncertainty and highly dependent on finalization of our strategic assessment our restructuring activity include our effort to rationalize our manufacturing footprint in gme whereby we reached agreement with the labor union in germany to terminate all vehicle and transmission production at our bochum germany facility at the end of affected employee are eligible for voluntary restructuring separation program restructuring charge were recorded primarily through the end of refer to note to our consolidated financial statement for additional information in the year

our operation in difficult environment we expect the european automotive industry to continue to moderately improve and we expect to be profitable in gme in in the year ending december we expect an increase in ebit adjusted and ebit adjusted margin due primarily to lower restructuring cost partially offset by higher engineering marketing and depreciation and amortization cost gmiowe are addressing many of the challenge in our gmio operation and continue to strategically ass the manner in which we operate in certain country within gmio in we announced the withdrawal of the chevrolet brand from western and central europe and the ceasing of manufacturing and significant reduction of engineering operation in australia by and incurred impairment and other charge in and we continue to execute these plan and within the financial impact that we projected we continue to ass our performance throughout the region additional restructuring and rationalization action may be required and may be material in the three month ended december due to significant decrease in domestic sale driven by political unrest and lack of consumer confidence domestically well ongoing weakness and trade challenge in several export market we performed recoverability test of our real and personal property asset in our thailand operation result we recorded impairment charge of billion in automotive cost

impact the region over the medium term however with the significant reduction in wholesale volume and forward pricing pressure we tested certain long lived asset for impairment and additional testing

pension funding obligation which are discussed under the caption critical accounting estimate pension the table above doe not reflect product warranty and related liability of billion and unrecognized tax benefit of billion due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflow associated with these amount critical accounting estimatesaccounting estimate are an integral part of the consolidated financial statement these estimate require the use of judgment and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability the disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense in the period presented we believe that the accounting estimate employed are appropriate and the resulting balance are reasonable however due to the inherent uncertainty in making estimate actual result could differ from the original estimate requiring adjustment to these balance in future period refer to note to our consolidated financial statement for our significant accounting policy related to our critical accounting estimate pension our defined benefit pension plan are accounted for on an actuarial basis which requires the selection of various assumption including an expected long term rate of return on plan asset discount rate mortality rate of participant and expectation of mortality improvement the expected long term rate of return on plan asset that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic study which include review of asset allocation strategy anticipated future long term performance of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesof individual asset class risk using standard deviation and correlation of return among the asset class that comprise the plan asset mix while the study give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical return the assumption are primarily long term prospective rate of return in december an investment policy study wa completed for the pension plan the study resulted in new target asset allocation being approved for the pension plan with resulting change to the expected long term rate of return on asset the weighted average long term rate of return on asset decreased from at december to at december another key assumption in determining net pension expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligation we estimate this rate for plan using cash flow matching approach which us projected cash flow matched to spot rate along high quality corporate yield curve to determine the present value of cash flow to calculate single equivalent discount rate mortality assumption for participant in our pension plan incorporate future mortality improvement from table published by the society of actuary soa we periodically review the mortality experience of our pension plan participant against these assumption in the three month ended december the soa issued new mortality and mortality improvement table that raise life expectancy and thereby indicate the amount of estimated aggregate benefit payment to our pension plan participant is increasing we have incorporated the new soa mortality and mortality improvement table into our december measurement of our pension plan benefit obligation the change in these assumption had the effect of increasing the december pension plan obligation by billion significant difference in actual experience or significant change in assumption may materially affect the pension obligation the effect of actual result differing from assumption and the changing of assumption are included in unamortized net actuarial gain and loss that are subject to amortization to expense over future period the unamortized pre tax actuarial gain loss on our pension plan wa billion and billion at december and the change is due primarily to the decrease in discount rate and the change in mortality assumption partially offset by actual asset return in excess of assumed return the underfunded status of the pension plan increased by billion in the year ended december to billion at december due primarily to an unfavorable effect of billion from decrease in discount rate an unfavorable effect of billion from an increase in life expectancy resulting in an increase in the benefit obligation and interest and service cost of billion partially

related plan asset and future net benefit payment refer to note to our consolidated financial statement for discussion of the input used to determine fair value for each significant asset class or category valuation of deferred tax assetsthe ability to realize deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward period provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction the assessment regarding whether valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible source of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factor our accounting for deferred tax consequence represents our best estimate of future event change in our current estimate due to unanticipated market condition or event could have material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax asset if law is enacted that reduces the statutory rate we would record significant reduction to the net deferred tax asset and related increase to income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date of the tax rate change sale incentive the estimated effect of sale incentive to dealer and end customer is recorded reduction of automotive net sale and revenue and in certain instance an increase to automotive cost of sale at the later of the time of sale or announcement of an incentive program to dealer there may be numerous type of incentive available at any particular time including choice of incentive for specific model incentive program are generally brand specific model specific or sale region specific and are for specified time period which may be extended significant factor used in estimating the cost of incentive include the volume of vehicle that will be affected by the incentive program offered by product product mix the rate of customer acceptance of any incentive program and the likelihood that an incentive program will be extended all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumption concerning customer behavior and future market condition when an incentive program is announced the number of vehicle in dealer inventory eligible for the incentive program is determined and reduction of automotive net sale and revenue or increase to automotive cost of sale is recorded in the period in which the program is announced if the actual number of affected vehicle differs from this estimate or if different mix of incentive is actually paid the reduction in automotive net sale and revenue or increase to automotive cost of sale for sale incentive could be affected there are multitude of input affecting the calculation of the estimate for sale incentive and an increase or decrease of any of these variable could have significant effect on recorded sale incentive policy product warranty and recall campaignswe have historically accrued estimated cost related to recall campaign in gmna when they are probable and reasonably estimable which typically occurs once it is determined specific recall campaign is needed and announced during the three month ended june following the significant increase in the number of vehicle subject to recall in gmna the result of our ongoing comprehensive safety review additional engineering analysis the creation of new global product integrity organization the appointment of new global vice president of vehicle safety responsible for the safety development of our vehicle system and our overall commitment to customer satisfaction we accumulated sufficient historical data in gmna to support the use of an actuarial based estimation technique for recall campaign such we now accrue at the time of vehicle sale in gmna the cost for recall campaign in the three month ended june we recorded catch up adjustment of billion in automotive cost of sale to adjust the estimate for recall cost for previously sold vehicle the change in estimate wa treated an adjustment for ebit adjusted reporting purpose in the other region there is not sufficient historical data to support the application of an actuarial based estimation technique and the estimated cost will continue to be accrued at the time when they are probable and reasonably estimable which typically occurs once it is determined specific recall campaign is needed and announced the estimate related to policy and product warranty are established using historical information on the nature frequency and average cost of claim of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumption about future activity and event when little or no claim experience exists for model year or vehicle line the estimate is based on comparable model the of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesestimates related to recall campaign accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying frequency time severity approach that considers the number of recall event the number of vehicle per recall event the assumed number of vehicle that will be brought in by customer for repair take rate and the cost per vehicle for each recall event estimate contemplate the nature frequency and magnitude of historical event with consideration for change in future expectation cost associated with campaign not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the per unit part and labor cost number of unit impacted and the take rate depending on part availability and time to complete repair we may from time to time offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customer these estimate are evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information revision are made when necessary we consider trend of claim and take action to improve vehicle quality and minimize claim in the six month ended june we recorded charge of billion for recall campaign and courtesy transportation that have been separately announced and billion related to the catch up adjustment associated with change in estimate the catch up adjustment and estimated amount accrued at the time of vehicle sale for recall campaign is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall event the number of vehicle per recall event the take rate and the cost per vehicle for each recall event the estimated cost of recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience we believe the amount recorded are adequate to cover the cost of these recall campaign increase in the estimated take rate for specifically announced recall campaign would increase the estimated cost by approximately billion actual experience could differ from the amount estimated requiring adjustment to these liability in future period due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factor contributing to developing estimate change in our assumption could

financial nonsegment operation are classified corporate corporate includes certain centrally recorded income and cost such interest income tax and corporate expenditure and certain nonsegment specific revenue and expense discussed in note we announced recall of approximately million vehicle and recorded charge of approximately billion in automotive cost of sale relating to recall campaign and

in consolidation certain prior year amount were reclassified to conform to our current year presentation in the three month ended march we changed our managerial and financial reporting structure to reclassify the result of our russian subsidiary previously reported in our gmio segment to our gme segment we have retrospectively revised the segment presentation for all period presented refer to note for additional information on our segment reporting we consolidate entity that we control due to ownership of majority voting interest and we consolidate variable interest entity vies when we have variable interest and are the primary beneficiary we continually evaluate our involvement with vies to determine when these criterion are met our share of earnings or loss of nonconsolidated affiliate is included in our consolidated operating result using the equity method of accounting when we are able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial decision of the affiliate we use the cost method of accounting if we are not able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial decision of the affiliate use of estimate in the preparation of the financial statement accounting estimate are an integral part of the consolidated financial statement these estimate require the use of judgment and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability the disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense in the period presented we believe that the accounting estimate employed are appropriate and the resulting balance are reasonable however due to the inherent uncertainty in making estimate actual result could differ from the original estimate requiring adjustment to these balance in future period change in accounting estimatewe historically accrued estimated cost related to recall campaign in gmna when they are probable and reasonably estimable which typically occurs once it is determined specific recall campaign is needed and announced during the three month ended june following the significant increase in the number of vehicle subject to recall in gmna the result of our ongoing comprehensive safety review additional engineering analysis the creation of new global product integrity organization the appointment of new global vice president of vehicle safety responsible for the safety development of our vehicle system and our overall commitment to customer satisfaction we accumulated sufficient historical data in gmna to support the use of an actuarial based estimation technique for recall campaign such we now accrue at the time of vehicle sale in gmna the cost for recall campaign based on expanded historical data we recorded catch up adjustment of million in automotive cost of sale in the three month ended june to adjust the estimate for recall cost for previously sold vehicle in other geographical region the historical claim data did not support the application of an actuarial based model therefore recall campaign are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable which typically occurs once it is determined specific recall campaign is needed and announced gm financial the amount presented for gm financial have been adjusted to include the effect of our tax attribute on gm financial deferred tax position and provision for income tax since the date of acquisition which are not applicable to gm financial on stand of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated

leasing incentive consisting of allowance and rebate are recorded reduction to automotive net sale and revenue at the time of vehicle sale all other incentive allowance and rebate related to vehicle previously sold are recorded reduction to automotive net sale and revenue when announced vehicle sale to daily rental car company with guaranteed repurchase obligation are accounted for operating lease estimated lease revenue is recorded ratably over the estimated term of the lease based on the difference between net sale proceeds and the guaranteed repurchase amount the difference between the

acquired at discount which contains two component non accretable difference and an accretable yield the accretable yield is recorded finance charge income over the life of the acquired receivables any deterioration in the performance of the pre acquisition finance receivables from their expected performance will result in an incremental provision for loan loss improvement in the performance of the pre acquisition finance receivables will result first in the reversal of any incremental related allowance for loan loss and then in transfer of the excess from the non accretable difference to

forecasting model to determine the allowance for loan loss factor that are considered when estimating the allowance include loss confirmation period historical delinquency migration to loss probability of default and loss given default the loss confirmation period is key assumption within the model which represents the average amount of time from when loss event first occurs to when the receivable is charged off consumer finance receivables that become classified tdrs are separately assessed for impairment specific allowance is estimated based on the present value of the expected future cash flow of the receivable discounted at the loan original effective interest rate consumer finance receivables are generally charged off in the month in which the account becomes day

korea position gm korea appealed to the supreme court of the republic of korea supreme court and initiated constitutional challenge to the adverse interpretation of the relevant statute in december the supreme court rendered decision in case involving another company not affiliated with which addressed many of the issue presented in the case pending against gm korea and resolved many of them in manner which we believe is favorable to gm korea in particular while the supreme court held that fixed bonus should be included in the calculation of ordinary wage it also held that claim for retroactive application of this rule would be barred under certain circumstance on may the supreme court rendered it decision with respect to the case involving the five gm korea employee and remanded the case to the seoul high court consistent with it december ruling in july gm korea and it labor union agreed to include bonus and certain allowance in ordinary wage retroactively to march therefore

outcome of the investigation or any resulting proceeding would not materially and adversely affect gm financial or any of it subsidiary and affiliate product liability with respect to product liability claim involving our and general motor corporation product we believe that any judgment against for actual damage will be adequately covered by our recorded accrual and where applicable excess liability insurance coverage although punitive damage are claimed in some of these lawsuit and such claim are inherently unpredictable accrual incorporate historic experience with these type of claim in addition we indemnify dealer for certain product liability related claim including product sold by general motor corporation dealer we monitor actual claim experience and make periodic adjustment to our estimate liability have been recorded in accrued liability and other liability for the expected cost of all known product liability claim plus an estimate of the expected cost for product liability claim that have already been incurred and are expected to be filed in the future for which we are self insured in light of recent vehicle recall it is reasonably possible that our accrual for product liability claim may increase in future period in material amount although we can not estimate reasonable range of incremental loss based on currently available information ignition switch recall compensation programin the three month ended june we announced the creation of compensation program the program to compensate accident victim who died or suffered physical injury or their family result of faulty ignition switch related to the million vehicle recalled more fully described in note it is important to our company that we reach everyone through this program who ha been impacted the program is being administered by an independent program administrator the independent administrator ha established protocol that defines the eligibility requirement to participate in the program there is no cap on the amount of payment that can be made to claimant under the program at december we have an accrual of million recorded in corporate which represents our best estimate of remaining amount that may be paid under the program however it is reasonably possible that the liability could exceed our recorded amount by approximately million the most significant estimate affecting the amount recorded include the number of participant that have eligible claim related to death and physical injury which also contemplates the severity of injury the length of hospital stay and related compensation amount and the number of people who actually elect to participate in the program our estimate is subject to significant uncertainty program of this nature are highly unusual and each eligible claim will have unique of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statement continued underlying fact pattern while we do not anticipate material change to our current estimate it is possible that material change could occur should actual eligible claim and the related compensation amount differ from this estimate the program accepted claim from august through january payment to eligible claimant began in the fourth quarter and will continue through the first half of accident victim or their family could choose not to participate in the program and pursue litigation against at january the program had received claim and the independent program administrator ha determined claim to be eligible for payment under the program remaining claim are either under review deficient awaiting further documentation or deemed ineligible based on currently available information we believe our accrual at december is adequate to cover the estimated cost under the program at january we have paid million to eligible claimant under the program accident victim that accept payment under the program agree to settle all claim against gm

regulating air emission water discharge waste management and environmental remediation liability have been recorded primarily in other liability for the expected cost to be paid over the period of

estimate are recorded necessary based upon additional information obtained in future period new law or regulation advance in remediation technology and additional information about the ultimate remediation methodology to be used could significantly change our estimate it is possible that the resolution of one or more environmental matter could exceed the amount accrued in an amount that
