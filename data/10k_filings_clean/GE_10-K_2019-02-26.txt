benefit from non rate below the statutory rate wa significant prior to the decrease in the statutory rate to beginning in while reduced there is still generally benefit certain non income is subject to local country tax rate that are below the new statutory tax rate the rate of tax on our profitable non earnings is below the statutory tax rate because we have significant business operation

these earnings have been reinvested in active non business operation and of december we have not decided to repatriate these earnings to the given tax reform substantially all of our prior unrepatriated earnings were subject to tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate available non cash from these earnings without additional federal tax cost and any foreign withholding tax on repatriation to the would potentially be partially offset by foreign tax credit ge form md aother consolidated information substantial portion of the benefit for lower taxed non earnings related to business operation subject to tax in country where the tax on that income is lower than the statutory rate is derived from our gecas aircraft leasing operation located in ireland where the earnings are taxed at from our power operation located in switzerland and hungary where the earnings are taxed at between and and our healthcare operation in europe where tax deduction are allowed for certain intangible asset and earnings are taxed below the historic statutory rate the rate of tax on non operation is increased however because we also incur loss in foreign jurisdiction

substantially reducing our borrowing capacity in the commercial paper market this transition did not have material impact to our access to liquidity or to our interest cost and these downgrade did not have any other material impact to our liquidity we are disclosing our credit rating and any current quarter update to these rating to enhance understanding of our source of liquidity and the effect of our rating on our cost of fund our rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating for description of some of the potential consequence of reduction in our credit rating see the financial risk section of risk factor the following section provide additional detail regarding the significant credit rating condition for the company in the event of further downgrade debt conditionssubstantially all of our debt agreement do not contain material credit rating covenant if our short term credit rating were to fall below we would no longer have access to the tier commercial paper market and therefore our borrowing capacity in the commercial paper market would likely be further reduced this may result in increased utilization of our revolving credit facility to fund our intra quarter operation derivative conditionsfair value of our derivative can change significantly from period to period based on among other factor market movement and change in our position we manage counterparty credit risk the risk that counterparties will default and not make payment to according to the term of our standard master agreement on an individual counterparty basis where we have agreed to netting of derivative exposure with counterparty we offset our exposure with that counterparty and apply the value of collateral posted to to determine the net exposure we actively monitor these net exposure against defined limit and take appropriate action in response including requiring additional collateral swap forward and option contract are executed under standard master agreement that typically contain mutual downgrade provision that provide the ability of the counterparty to require termination if the credit rating of the applicable ge entity were to fall below specified rating level agreed upon with the counterparty primarily bbb our master agreement also typically contain provision that provide termination right upon the occurrence of certain other event such bankruptcy or event of default by one of the party if an agreement wa terminated under any of these circumstance the termination amount payable would be determined on net basis and could also take into account any collateral posted the net amount of our derivative liability subject to such termination provision after consideration of collateral posted by and outstanding interest payment wa billion at december this excludes exposure related to embedded derivative which do not have these provision ge form md acapital resource and liquidity in addition certain of our derivative primarily interest rate swap are subject to additional margin posting requirement if our credit rating were to fall below bbb the amount of additional margin will vary based on among other factor market movement and change in our position at december the amount of additional margin that we could be required to post in cash if we fell below these rating level wa approximately billion see note to the consolidated financial statement for further information about our risk exposure our use of derivative and the effect of this activity on our financial statement other conditionswhere we provide servicing for third party investor ge is contractually permitted to commingle cash collected from customer on financing receivables sold to third party investor with our own cash prior to payment to third party investor provided our short term credit rating doe not fall below in the event any of our rating were to fall below such level we may be required to segregate certain of these cash collection owed to third party investor into restricted bank account and would lose the short term liquidity benefit of commingling with respect to such collection the financial impact to our intra quarter liquidity would vary based on collection activity for given quarter and may result in increased utilization of our revolving credit facility the loss of cash commingling would have resulted in maximum reduction of approximately billion to ge intra quarter liquidity during the fourth quarter of in addition we have relied and may continue to rely on securitization program to provide alternative funding for sale of ge receivables to third party investor if any of our short term credit rating were to fall below the timing or amount of liquidity generated by these program could be adversely impacted in the fourth quarter of the estimated maximum reduction to our ending liquidity had our credit rating fallen below these level wa approximately billion foreign exchange and interest rate risksexchange rate and interest rate risk are managed with variety of technique including selective use of derivative we use derivative to mitigate or eliminate certain financial and market risk because we conduct business in diverse market around the world and local funding is not always efficient in addition we use derivative to adjust the debt we are issuing to match the fixed or floating nature of the asset we are originating we apply strict policy to manage each of these risk including prohibition on speculative activity following is an analysis of the potential effect of change in interest rate and currency exchange rate using so called shock test that seek to model the effect of shift in rate such test are inherently limited based on the assumption used described further below and should not be viewed forecast actual effect would depend on many variable including market factor and the composition of the company asset and liability at that time it is our policy to minimize exposure to interest rate change and their impact to interest and other financial charge we fund our financial investment using debt or combination of debt and hedging instrument so that the interest rate of our borrowing match the expected interest rate profile on our asset to test the effectiveness of our hedging action we assumed that on january interest rate decreased by basis point across the yield curve parallel shift in that curve and further assumed that the decrease remained in place for the next month based on the year end portfolio and holding all other assumption constant we estimated that our consolidated net earnings for the next month starting in january would decline by le than billion result of this parallel shift in the yield curve additionally refer to the critical accounting estimate section within this md for further interest rate sensitivity related to pension and insurance reserve assumption it is our policy to minimize currency exposure and to conduct operation either within functional currency or using the protection of hedge strategy we analyzed year end consolidated currency exposure including derivative designated and effective hedge to identify asset and liability denominated in other than their relevant functional currency for such asset and liability we evaluated the effect of shift in exchange rate between those currency and the dollar holding all other assumption constant this analysis indicated that our consolidated net earnings would decline by le than billion result of such shift in exchange rate this analysis excludes any translation impact from change in exchange rate on our financial result and any offsetting effect from the forecasted future transaction that are economically hedged foreign currencyas result of our global operation we generate and incur significant portion of our revenue and expense in currency other than the dollar such principal currency are euro the pound sterling the brazilian real and the chinese renminbi the result of operating entity reported in currency other than dollar are translated to the dollar at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in the financial statement we use number of technique to manage the effect of currency exchange including selective borrowing in local currency and selective hedging of significant cross currency transaction the foreign currency effect arising from operating activity outside of the including the remeasurement of derivative can result in significant transactional foreign currency fluctuation at point in time but will generally be offset the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings the effect of foreign currency fluctuation excluding the earnings impact of the underlying hedged item decreased net earnings for the year ended december by le than billion see note to the consolidated financial statement for further information about our risk exposure our use of derivative and the effect of this activity on our financial statement ge form md acapital resource and liquidity statement of cash flow overview from through we manage the cash flow performance of our industrial and financial service business separately we therefore believe it is useful to report separate ge and ge capital column in our

separately from the financing cash flow of our financial service business well to evaluate the cash flow between our industrial business and ge capital all other operating activity reflect cash source

our most significant accounting policy revenue recognition on long term service agreement we have long term service agreement with our customer predominately within our power aviation transportation and oil gas segment these agreement require to maintain the customer asset over the contract term contract term are generally to year however contract modification that extend or revise contract are not uncommon we recognize revenue we perform under the arrangement based upon cost incurred at the estimated margin rate of the contract revenue recognition on long term service agreement requires estimate of both customer payment expected to be received over the contract term well the cost to perform required maintenance service customer generally pay based on the utilization of the asset per hour of usage for example or upon the occurrence of major event within the contract such an overhaul result significant estimate in determining expected revenue of contract is estimating how customer will utilize their asset over the term of the agreement the estimate of utilization will impact both the amount of customer payment we expect to receive and our estimate of cost to complete the agreement asset utilization will influence the timing and extent of overhaul and other service event over the life of the contract we generally use combination of both historical utilization trend well forward looking information such market condition and potential asset retirement in developing our revenue estimate to develop our cost estimate we consider the timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul event including the amount and cost of labor spare part and other resource required to perform the service in developing our cost estimate we utilize combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvement cost improvement are only included in future cost estimate after saving have been observed in actual result or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process ge form md acritical accounting estimate we routinely review estimate under long term service agreement and regularly revise them to adjust for change in outlook these revision are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review contract modification that change the right and obligation well the nature timing and extent of future cash flow are effectively accounted for new contract the difference between the timing of our revenue recognition and cash received from our customer result in either contract asset revenue in excess of billing or contract liability billing in excess of revenue of december and we are in net contract asset position of billion and billion including contract in liability position totaling billion and billion respectively we regularly ass expected billing adjustment and customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amount of receivables and contract asset and estimated earnings including the risk that contractual penalty may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination we gain insight into future utilization and cost trend well credit risk through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and the close interaction with our customer that come with supplying critical service and part over extended period revision may affect long term service agreement total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings such adjustment decreased earnings by billion in and increased earnings by billion and billion in and respectively on december our net long term service agreement balance of billion represents approximately of our total estimated life of contract billing of billion our contract on average are approximately complete based on cost incurred to date and our estimate of future cost revision to our estimate of future billing or cost that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by one percentage point would increase or decrease the long term service agreement balance by billion cash billing collected on these contract were billion and billion during the year ended december and respectively see note and to the consolidated financial statement for further information fair value measurementsassets and liability measured at fair value every reporting period include investment in debt and equity security and derivative other asset and liability are subject to fair value measurement only in certain circumstance including purchase accounting applied to asset and liability acquired in business combination impaired loan that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral equity security without readily determinable fair value and equity method investment and long lived asset that are written down to fair value when they are impaired upon closing an acquisition we estimate the fair value of asset and liability acquired and integrate the acquisition soon practicable the size scope and complexity of an acquisition will affect the time it take to obtain the necessary information to record the acquired asset and liability at fair value it may take up to one year to finalize the initial fair value estimate used in the preliminary purchase accounting accordingly it is reasonably likely that our initial estimate will be subsequently revised which could affect carrying amount of goodwill intangible and potentially other asset and liability in our financial statement asset that are written down to fair value le cost to sell when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs fair value measurement is determined the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date in the absence of active market for the identical asset or liability such measurement involve developing assumption based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with market participant would use in hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgment about assumption such determining an appropriate discount rate that factor in both risk and liquidity premium identifying the similarity and difference in market transaction weighting those difference accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustment to those market transaction to reflect the risk specific to our asset being valued see note and to the consolidated financial statement for further information on fair value measurement and related matter asset impairmentasset impairment assessment involves various estimate and assumption that may leverage the fair value measurement described above and include investmentswe regularly review investment security for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criterion for debt security if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost we evaluate other qualitative criterion to determine whether credit loss exists such the financial health of and specific prospect for the issuer including whether the issuer is in compliance with the term and covenant of the security quantitative criterion include determining whether there ha been an adverse change in expected future cash flow our other than temporary impairment review involve our finance risk and asset management function well the portfolio management and research capability of our internal and third party asset manager ge form md acritical accounting estimate see note and to the consolidated financial statement for further information about the determination of fair value for investment security and actual and potential impairment loss long lived assetswe review long lived asset for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment ha occurred typically requires various estimate and assumption including determining which undiscounted cash flow are directly related to the potentially impaired asset the useful life over which cash flow will occur their amount and the asset residual value if any in turn measurement of an impairment loss requires determination of fair value which is based on the best information available we derive the required undiscounted cash flow estimate from our historical experience and our internal business plan to determine fair value we use quoted market price when available our internal cash flow estimate discounted at an appropriate discount rate and independent appraisal appropriate our operating lease portfolio of commercial aircraft is significant concentration of asset in capital and is particularly subject to market fluctuation therefore we test recoverability of each aircraft in our operating lease portfolio at least annually additionally we perform quarterly evaluation in circumstance such when aircraft are leased current lease term have changed or specific lessee credit standing change we consider market condition such global demand for commercial aircraft estimate of future rental and residual value are based on historical experience and information received routinely from independent appraiser estimated cash flow from future lease are reduced for expected downtime between lease and for estimated cost required to prepare aircraft to be redeployed fair value used to measure impairment is based on management best estimate which are benchmarked against third party appraiser current market value for aircraft of similar type and age see note and to the consolidated financial statement for further information on impairment loss and our exposure to the commercial aviation industry goodwill and other identified intangible assetswe test goodwill for impairment annually in the third quarter of each year using data of july of that year the impairment test consists of two step in step one the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared with it fair value in step two which is applied when the carrying value is more than it fair value the amount of goodwill impairment if any is derived by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit asset and liability from the fair value of it equity and comparing that amount with the carrying amount of goodwill we determined fair value for each of the reporting unit using the market approach when available and appropriate or the income approach or combination of both we ass the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation if multiple valuation methodology are used the result are weighted appropriately valuation using the market approach are derived from metric of publicly traded company or historically completed transaction of comparable business the selection of comparable business is based on the market in which the reporting unit operate giving consideration to risk profile size geography and diversity of product and service market approach is limited to reporting unit for which there are publicly traded company that have the characteristic similar to our business under the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flow discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted rate we use our internal forecast to estimate future cash flow and include an estimate of long term future growth rate based on our most recent view of the long term outlook for each business actual result may differ from those assumed in our forecast we derive our discount rate using capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rate for industry relevant to our reporting unit to estimate the cost of equity financing we use discount rate that are commensurate with the risk and uncertainty inherent in the respective business and in our internally developed forecast discount rate used in our annual reporting unit valuation ranged from to estimating the fair value of reporting unit requires the use of estimate and significant judgment that are based on number of factor including actual operating result it is reasonably possible that the judgment and estimate described above could change in future period we review identified intangible asset with defined useful life and subject to amortization for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flow expected to be generated by the asset we test intangible asset with indefinite life annually for impairment using fair value method such discounted cash flow see note and to the consolidated financial statement for further information business and asset held for salebusinesses and asset held for sale represent component that meet the accounting requirement to be classified held for sale and are presented single asset and liability amount in our financial statement with valuation allowance if necessary to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fair value le cost to sell financing receivables that no longer qualify to be presented held for investment must be classified asset held for sale and recognized in our financial statement at the lower of cost or fair value le cost to sell with that amount representing new cost basis at the date of transfer ge form md acritical accounting estimate the determination of fair value for business and asset held for sale involves significant judgment and assumption development of estimate of fair value in this circumstance is complex and is dependent upon among other factor the nature of the potential sale transaction for example asset sale versus sale of legal entity composition of asset and or business in the disposal group the comparability of the disposal group to market transaction negotiation with third party purchaser etc such factor bear directly on the range of potential fair value and the selection of the best estimate key assumption are developed based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participant would use in hypothetical transaction we review all business and asset held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amount are fully recoverable in comparison to estimated fair value pension assumption pension assumption are significant input to the actuarial model that measure pension benefit obligation and related effect on operation two assumption discount rate and expected return on asset are important element of plan expense and asset liability measurement we evaluate these critical assumption at least annually on plan and country specific basis we periodically evaluate other assumption involving demographic factor such retirement age mortality and turnover and update them to reflect our experience and expectation for the future actual result in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumption because of economic and other factor projected benefit obligation are measured the present value of expected payment we discount those cash payment using the weighted average of market observed yield for high quality fixed income security with maturity that correspond to the payment of benefit lower discount rate increase present value and generally increase subsequent year pension expense higher discount rate decrease present value and generally reduce subsequent year pension expense our discount rate for principal pension plan at december and were and respectively reflecting market interest rate to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan asset we consider our asset allocation well historical and expected return on various category of plan asset in developing future long term return expectation for our principal benefit plan asset we formulate view on the future economic environment both in the and abroad we evaluate general market trend and historical relationship among number of key variable that impact asset class return such expected earnings growth inflation valuation yield and spread using both internal and external source we also take into account expected volatility by asset class and diversification across class to determine expected overall portfolio result given our asset allocation asset in our principal pension plan declined in and had annualized return of and in the and year period ended december respectively based on our analysis of future expectation of asset performance past return result and our asset allocation we have assumed long term expected return on those asset for cost recognition in and compared to in and change in key assumption for our principal pension plan would have the following effect discount rate basis point increase in discount rate would decrease pension cost in the following year by billion and would decrease the pension benefit obligation at year end by about billion expected return on asset basis point decrease in the expected return on asset would increase pension cost in the following year by billion see other consolidated information postretirement benefit

tax planning opportunity available to in the various jurisdiction in which we operate tax law are complex and subject to different interpretation by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authority significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax position including evaluating uncertainty we review our tax position quarterly and adjust the

on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the historically tax were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings due to the enactment of tax reform most repatriation of foreign earnings will be free of federal income tax but may incur withholding or state tax indefinite reinvestment is determined by management judgment about and intention concerning the future operation of the

this complex guidance correctly will result in all change in the fair value of the derivative being reported in earnings without regard to the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item in evaluating whether particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting we test effectiveness at inception and each reporting period thereafter by determining whether change in the fair value of the

and development when loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss when there appears to be range of possible cost with equal likelihood liability are based on the low end of such range however the likelihood of loss with respect to particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining meaningful estimate of the loss or range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future event and decision by third party that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency moreover it is not uncommon for such matter to be resolved over many year during which time relevant development and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate range of possible loss ge form md acritical accounting estimate disclosure is provided for material loss contingency when loss is probable but reasonable estimate can not be made and when it is reasonably possible that loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of loss

the benefit available and cause of disability of the claimant well assumption derived from our actual historical experience and expected future change in experience factor claim reserve are evaluated periodically for potential change in loss estimate with the support of qualified actuary and any change are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined reinsurance recoverableswe cede insurance risk to third party reinsurers for portion of our insurance contract primarily on long term care insurance policy we are not relieved from our primary obligation to policyholder or cedents we record receivables that are estimated in manner consistent with the future policy benefit reserve and claim reserve reserve ceded to reinsurers net of allowance were billion and billion at december and respectively and are included in the caption other ge capital receivables on our consolidated statement of financial position premium deficiency testingwe annually perform premium deficiency testing in the aggregate across our run off insurance portfolio the premium deficiency testing ass the adequacy of future policy benefit reserve net of capitalized acquisition cost using current assumption without provision for adverse deviation comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumption is complex process and depends on number of factor many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance product the vast majority of our run off insurance operation consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entity with underlying treaty having complex term and condition premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entity and considers the underlying treaty in order to utilize that information for purpose of completing experience study covering all key assumption we perform detailed procedure to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entity our long term care insurance business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained age is still emerging and to the extent that future experience deviate from current expectation new projection of claim cost extending over the expected life of the policy may be required significant uncertainty exist in making current projection for these long term care insurance contract that include consideration of wide range of possible outcome ge form md aother item the primary assumption used in the premium deficiency test include morbidity morbidity assumption used in estimating future policy benefit reserve are based on estimate of expected incidence of disability and claim cost and include consideration of expected future morbidity and mortality improvement for long term care exposure estimating expected future cost includes assessment of incidence probability of having claim utilization amount of available benefit expected to be incurred and continuance how long the claim will last prior to premium deficiency assumption considered the risk of anti selection by including issue age adjustment to morbidity based on an actuarial assumption that long term care policy issued to younger individual would exhibit lower expected incidence and claim cost than those issued to older policyholder recent claim experience and the development of reconstructed claim cost curve indicated minimal issue age difference impacting claim cost projection and accordingly beginning in issue age adjustment were no longer assumed in developing morbidity assumption higher morbidity increase while higher morbidity improvement decrease the present value of expected future benefit payment mortality mortality assumption used in estimating future policy benefit reserve are based on published mortality table adjusted for the result of our experience study and estimate of expected future mortality improvement for life insurance product higher mortality increase the present value of expected future benefit payment while for annuity and long term care insurance contract higher mortality decrease the present value of expected future benefit payment discount rate interest rate assumption used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserve are based on expected investment yield net of related investment expense and expected default in estimating future yield we consider the actual yield on our current investment security held by our run off insurance operation and the future rate at which we expect to reinvest any proceeds from investment security maturity and the projected future capital contribution into our run off insurance operation higher future yield result in higher discount rate and lower present value of future policy benefit reserve future long term care premium rate increase reinsurer we rely upon the primary insurer that underwrite the underlying policy to file proposed rate increase to the relevant state insurance regulator we have no ability to institute premium rate increase on the policyholder we consider recent experience of rate increase filing made by our ceding company along with state insurance regulatory process in establishing our current expectation higher future premium rate increase lower the present value of future policy benefit reserve during in response to elevated claim experience for portion of our long term care insurance contract that wa most pronounced for policyholder with higher attained age we initiated comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumption across all insurance product which included reconstructing our future claim cost projection for long term care contract utilizing trend observed in our emerging experience for older claimant age and later duration policy certain of our long term care policyholder only recently started to reach the prime claim paying period and our new claim cost assumption considered the emerging credibility of this claim data in addition to the adverse impact from the revised future claim cost projection over long term horizon our premium deficiency assumption considered mortality length of time policy will remain in force and both near term and longer term investment return expectation future investment yield estimated in were lower than in previous premium deficiency test primarily due to the effect of near term yield on approximately billion of future expected capital contribution discussed below the capital contribution will be invested at the current market yield which had the impact of lowering the average long term investment yield used to calculate the discount rate and such further adversely impacted the estimated premium deficiency our discount rate assumption for purpose of performing the premium deficiency assessment resulted in weighted average rate of approximately compared to approximately in the test indicated premium deficiency requiring the unlocking of reserve and resetting of actuarial assumption to current assumption this resulted in billion pre tax charge to earnings in which included billion impairment of deferred acquisition cost billion impairment of present value of future profit and an billion increase in future policy benefit reserve during we integrated these new assumption into our system and process embedded in our framework of internal control over financial reporting in connection with our premium deficiency test in addition to reinsurance recoverables of billion were largely offset by an allowance for loss of billion based upon our assessment of collectability that would otherwise have reduced the earnings impact of the premium deficiency the vast majority of our remaining net reinsurance recoverables are secured by asset held in trust for which we are the beneficiary during the fourth quarter of we completed our annual premium deficiency test this review included updated experience study based on up to four quarter of additional data since the test and considered updated external input based on industry trend and adjustment to assumption result we experienced premium deficiency in our premium deficiency test started with zero margin and accordingly any adverse development would result in future charge to earnings based on this analysis using our most recent future policy benefit reserve assumption we identified premium deficiency which resulted in billion pre tax charge to earnings in the increase to future policy benefit reserve wa primarily attributable to the following key assumption change ge form md aother item increased discount rate assumption in compared to our original estimate our revised reinvestment plan incorporates the remaining projected capital contribution of approximately billion through of which approximately billion wa received in the first quarter of and introduction of strategic initiative for the investment into new higher yielding asset class while maintaining an overall rated fixed income portfolio these initiative are the result of an extensive review in of our investment management opportunity including the engagement of external investment advisor our discount rate assumption for purpose of performing the premium deficiency assessment resulted in weighted average rate of approximately compared to approximately in the increased discount rate favorably impacted our reserve margin by billion lower long term care insurance morbidity improvement assumption indicating le long term improvement per year over shorter duration between and year based on the average attained age of the underlying book of business which adversely impacted our reserve margin by billion higher interest rate leading to higher inflation which increased projected utilization on long term care insurance policy which adversely impacted our reserve margin by billion lower policy termination on long term care insurance policy and revision to assumption of future mortality primarily for older attained age based on experience analysis of internal and industry data on life insurance product which adversely impacted our reserve margin by billion and billion respectively and higher level of projected long term care premium rate increase due to larger rate filing by some ceding company than previously planned which favorably impacted our reserve margin by billion our premium deficiency test includes approximately billion of anticipated premium increase or benefit reduction associated with future in force rate action including action that are approved and not implemented filed but not yet approved and estimated on future filing through gaap reserve sensitivitiesthe result of our premium deficiency testing are sensitive to the assumption described above certain future adverse change in our assumption could result in the unlocking of reserve resetting of actuarial assumption to current assumption an increase to future policy benefit reserve and charge to earnings considering the result of the premium deficiency test which reset our margin to zero any future adverse change in our assumption could result in an increase to future policy benefit reserve for example adverse change in key assumption to our future policy benefit reserve holding all other assumption constant would have the following effect presented in the table below any favorable change to these assumption could result in additional margin in our premium deficiency test and higher income over the remaining duration of the portfolio including higher investment income the assumption within our future policy benefit reserve are subject to significant uncertainty including those inherent in the complex nature of our reinsurance treaty many of our assumption are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance product small change in the amount used in the sensitivity or the use of different factor could result in materially different

the required statutory capital level of our insurance legal entity and therefore may affect the amount or timing of capital contribution from ge capital to the insurance legal entity statutory accounting practice are set forth by the national association of insurance commissioner naic well state law regulation and general administrative rule and differ in certain respect from gaap under statutory accounting practice base formulaic reserve assumption typically do not change unless approved by our primary regulator kid in addition to base reserve statutory accounting practice require additional actuarial reserve aar be established based on result of asset adequacy testing reflecting moderately adverse condition assumption include provision for adverse deviation pad rather than current assumption without pad required for premium deficiency testing under gaap result our statutory asset adequacy testing assumption reflect le long term care insurance morbidity improvement and for shorter duration restriction on future long term care insurance premium rate increase no life insurance mortality improvement and lower discount rate result several of the sensitivity described in the table above would be le impactful on our statutory reserve the adverse impact on our statutory aar arising from our revised assumption in including the collectability of reinsurance recoverables is expected to require ge capital to contribute approximately billion additional capital to it run off insurance operation in for statutory accounting purpose kid approved our request for permitted accounting practice to recognize the aar increase over seven year period ge capital provided capital contribution to it insurance subsidiary of approximately billion and billion in the first quarter of and respectively ge capital expects to provide further capital contribution of approximately billion through subject to ongoing monitoring by kid ge is party to capital maintenance agreement with erac and uflic whereby ge will maintain their minimum statutory capital level at of their year end authorized control level risk based capital requirement defined from time to time by the naic if our future policy benefit reserve established under gaap are realized over the estimated remaining life of our run off insurance obligation we would expect the billion of capital contributed to the run off insurance operation over the to period to be considered statutory capital surplus at the end of the period with no additional charge to gaap earnings however should the more conservative statutory assumption be realized we would be required to record the difference between gaap assumption and statutory assumption charge to gaap earnings in the future period see other item new accounting standard within this md and note and to the consolidated financial statement for further information new accounting standardsin august the financial accounting standard board fasb issued accounting standard update asu no financial service insurance topic targeted improvement to the accounting for long duration contract the asu is effective for period beginning after december with an election to adopt early we are evaluating the effect of the standard on our consolidated financial statement and anticipate that it adoption will significantly change the accounting for measurement of our long duration insurance liability the asu requires cash flow assumption used in the measurement of various insurance liability to be reviewed at least annually and updated if actual experience or other evidence indicates previous assumption need to be revised with any required change recorded in earnings under the current accounting guidance the discount rate is based on expected investment yield while under the asu the discount rate will be equivalent to the upper medium grade single fixed income instrument yield reflecting the duration characteristic of the liability and is required to be updated in each reporting period with change recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in measuring the insurance liability contract shall not be grouped together from different issue year these change result in the elimination of premium deficiency testing and shadow adjustment while we continue to evaluate the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting we anticipate that the adoption of the asu will materially affect our financial statement the asu is only applicable to the measurement of our long duration insurance liability under gaap it will not affect the accounting for our insurance reserve or the level of capital and surplus under statutory accounting practice in august the fasb issued asu no derivative and hedging topic targeted improvement to accounting for hedging activity the asu is effective for period beginning after december with an election to adopt early the asu requires certain change to the presentation of hedge accounting in the financial statement and some new or modified disclosure the asu also simplifies the application of hedge accounting and expands the strategy that qualify for hedge accounting the asu will not have material effect to our financial statement ge form md aother item in january the fasb issued asu no intangible goodwill and other topic simplifying the test for goodwill impairment the asu is effective for period beginning after december with an election to adopt early the asu requires only one step quantitative impairment test whereby goodwill impairment loss will be measured the excess of reporting unit carrying amount over it fair value it eliminates step of the current two step goodwill impairment test under which goodwill impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the asu is to be applied prospectively it will not impact our previously reported financial statement in february the fasb issued asu no lease the new standard establishes right of use model that requires lessee to record right of use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all lease with term longer than month lease will be classified either finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition similarly lessor will be required to classify lease sale type finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern of income recognition classification for both lessee and lessor will be based on an assessment of whether risk and reward well substantive control have been transferred through lease contract the new standard is effective for fiscal year beginning after december including interim period within those fiscal year with early adoption permitted we plan to elect the new transition method approved by the fasb on july which allows company to apply the provision of the new leasing standard of january without adjusting the comparative period presented by recognizing cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings we finalize our system solution and adoption process we estimate the adoption of the asu will result in the recognition of right of use asset and related lease liability in the range of approximately billion to billion with an estimated immaterial effect to our retained earnings cash received by ge capital on financing lease is classified cash from investing activity for the three year period ended december after adoption such cash receipt will be classified cash from operating activity in june the fasb issued asu no financial instrument credit loss the asu introduces new accounting model the current expected credit loss model cecl which requires earlier recognition of credit loss and additional disclosure related to credit risk the cecl model utilizes lifetime expected credit loss measurement objective for the recognition of credit loss for loan and other receivables at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired the expected credit loss are adjusted each period for change in expected lifetime credit loss this model replaces the multiple existing impairment model in current gaap which generally require that loss be incurred before it is recognized the new standard will also apply to receivables arising from revenue transaction such contract asset and account receivables well reinsurance recoverables at ge capital run off insurance operation and is effective for fiscal year beginning after december we continue to evaluate the effect of the standard on our

discussion of risk factor contains forward looking statement discussed in the forward looking statement section these risk factor may be important to understanding any statement in this form report or elsewhere the risk described below should not be considered complete list of potential risk that we may face the following information should be read in conjunction with the management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation md section and the consolidated financial statement and related note we also incorporate the risk described in bhge form report and other sec filing the risk we describe in this form report or in our other sec filing could have material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and result of operation our business routinely encounter and address risk some of which will cause our future result to be different sometimes materially different than we presently anticipate below we describe certain important strategic operational financial and legal and compliance risk our reaction to material future development well our competitor reaction to those development will affect our future result strategic risk strategic risk relates to the company future business plan and strategy including the risk associated with our portfolio of business and capital allocation decision disposition merger and acquisition and restructuring activity the global macro environment in which we operate intellectual property and other risk including the demand for our product and service competitive threat and the success of investment in our technology and other product and service innovation portfolio strategy execution our success depends on achieving our strategic and financial objective including through disposition or other business separation previously announced we are pursuing variety of disposition including the planned sale of our biopharma business within our healthcare segment and plan to exit our equity ownership position in bhge and wabtec the proceeds that we expect to receive from such action are an important source of cash flow for the company part of our strategic and financial planning we seek to sell or separate certain asset equity interest or business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyer managing interdependency across multiple transaction and other company initiative implementing separation plan or executing alternative exit strategy on acceptable term which could delay or prevent the accomplishment of our strategic and financial objective including our goal of reducing the company leverage to targeted level over time in particular some of the sale and disposition strategy that we are considering or may consider will depend on favorable condition in the capital market for execution on our preferred timeline and decline in market valuation that adversely impact the value of equity interest or other asset that we sell will diminish the cash proceeds that we can realize through such sale we may dispose of asset or business at price or on term that are le favorable than we had anticipated or with the exclusion of asset that must be divested or run off separately we may also face limitation in the form of regulatory or governmental approval that prevent certain prospective purchaser from completing transaction with or delay from executing transaction on our preferred timeline or arising from our debt or other contractual obligation that limit our ability to complete certain asset or business disposition moreover the effect of planned transaction over time will reduce the company cash flow and earnings capacity and result in le diversified portfolio of business and we will have greater dependency on remaining business for our financial result executing on these transaction can divert senior management time and resource from other pursuit particularly with transaction structure that result in partial ge ownership and continuing governance or oversight right in separate company disposition or other business separation may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such through continuing equity ownership transition service agreement guarantee indemnity or other current or contingent financial obligation or liability under these arrangement performance by the divested business or other condition outside our control could materially affect our future financial result with respect to past and potential future acquisition joint venture and business integration we may not achieve expected return and other benefit result of change in strategy or integration and collaboration challenge related to personnel it system or other factor for example the anticipated return from the combination of our oil gas business with baker hughes that we completed in july included cost and growth synergy benefit over multi year period that we may not fully realize or that we may realize to lesser extent than originally projected we execute on our announced plan of an orderly separation from bhge in addition in connection with merger and acquisition over time we have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible asset on our balance sheet and if we are not able to realize the value of these asset we may be required to incur charge relating to the impairment of these asset we also participate in number of joint venture with other company or government enterprise in various market around the world including joint venture where we may have lesser degree of control over the business operation which may expose to additional operational financial legal or compliance risk ge form risk factor restructuring personnel we are undertaking extensive cost reduction and restructuring effort these effort may have adverse effect on our operation employee retention and result and may not achieve the expected benefit we are undertaking extensive restructuring action that include workforce reduction global facility consolidation and other cost reduction initiative these action are central component of our effort to improve operational and financial performance the period of substantial change across our organizational structure senior leadership culture functional alignment outsourcing and other area that we are in the midst of pose risk in the form of personnel capacity constraint and institutional knowledge loss that could lead to missed performance or financial target loss of key personnel and harm to our reputation the risk of capacity constraint is also heightened with the number of interdependent and transformational business portfolio and internal action that we are undertaking during period of significant restructuring and cost reduction across the company moreover if we do not successfully manage our restructuring and other transformational activity expected efficiency benefit and operational improvement might be delayed or not realized and our operation and business could be disrupted risk associated with these action include unforeseen delay in implementation of workforce reduction additional unexpected cost adverse effect on employee morale loss of key employee or other retention issue inability to attract and hire talented professional or the failure to meet operational target due to the loss of employee or work stoppage any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reduction or may otherwise harm our business and have an adverse effect on our competitive position or financial performance global macro environment our growth is subject to global economic and political risk we operate in virtually every part of the world and serve customer in over country in of our revenue wa attributable to activity outside the united state our operation and the execution of our business plan and strategy are subject to the effect of global competition and geopolitical risk they are also affected by local and regional economic environment including interest rate monetary policy inflation recession currency volatility currency control or other limitation on the ability to expatriate cash and actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt for example change in local economic condition such an economic slowdown in china or other key market or fluctuation in exchange rate may affect demand for or the profitability of our product and service outside the and the impact on the company could be significant given the extent of our activity outside the political change and trend such populism protectionism economic nationalism and sentiment toward multinational company and resulting change to trade tax or other law and policy may be disruptive and can interfere with our global operating model our supply chain our customer relationship and competitive position an increase in trade conflict could lead to significant deterioration of global growth and related decrease in confidence or investment activity in the global market would adversely affect our business performance we also do business in many emerging market jurisdiction where economic political and legal risk are heightened while some type of these economic risk can be hedged using derivative or other financial instrument and some are insurable such attempt to mitigate these risk are costly and not always successful and our ability to engage in such mitigation may decrease or become even more costly result of more volatile market condition competitive environment we are dependent on the maintenance of existing product line and service relationship market acceptance of new product and service introduction and innovation for revenue and earnings growth the market in which we operate are highly competitive in term of pricing product and service quality product development and introduction time customer service financing term and shift in market demand and competitor are increasingly offering service for our installed base our business are also subject to technological change and require to continually attract and retain skilled talent our long term operating result and competitive position depend substantially upon our ability to continually develop introduce and market new and innovative product service and platform to modify existing product and service to customize product and service to increase our productivity we perform on long term service agreement to anticipate and respond to market and technological change driven by trend such increased digitization or automation or by development such climate change that present both risk and opportunity for our business failure to be adequately market based or to accurately forecast customer demand and industry trend may adversely affect our delivery of product service and outcome in line with our projected financial performance or cost estimate and ultimately may result in excess cost build up of inventory that becomes obsolete lower profit margin and an erosion of our competitive position for example our aviation business is in the midst of increasing the production volume for it leap engine and successful ramp in engine commitment over the next year will require significant coordination across supply chain system material training logistics and other area to achieve expected level of cost and profitability in addition increased use of alternative energy source due to greater cost competitiveness of such source or change in technology or consumer preference could adversely affect the demand for our product and related service that are used in power generation or other application that use oil or natural gas energy source and result could have material adverse effect on the performance of our business or our consolidated result the introduction of innovative and disruptive technology in the market in which we operate can also pose risk in the form of new competitor substitution of existing product service or solution niche player new business model and competitor that are faster to market with new product or service than we are our capacity to invest in research and development effort to pursue advancement in wide range of technology product and service depends on the financial resource that we have available for such investment relative to other capital allocation priority and under investment could lead to the loss of market share for our product and service the amount that we do invest in research and development divert resource from other potential investment in our business and our effort may not lead to the development of new technology or product on timely basis or meet the need of our customer fully competitive offering ge form risk factor intellectual property our intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitor from independently developing product and service similar to or duplicative to and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted by external dependency our patent and other intellectual property may not prevent competitor from independently developing or selling product and service similar to or duplicative of ours and there can be no assurance that the resource invested by to protect our intellectual property will be sufficient or that our intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of our technology in the context of the company recent performance and planned portfolio action the value of the ge brand may be negatively impacted and we may offer multiple long term and concurrent trademark license of the ge brand in connection with disposition that may negatively impact the overall value of the brand in the future result of increased number of employee exit due to restructuring activity or otherwise we also face heightened risk related to the loss or unauthorized use of the company intellectual property or other protected data we could also face competition in some country where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio if we are not able to protect our intellectual property the value of our brand and other intangible asset may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected we also face attempt to gain unauthorized access to our it system or product for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secret or confidential business information the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secret and other confidential business information result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and the value of our investment in research and development in addition we may be the target of enforcement of patent or other intellectual property by third party including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claim by non practicing entity regardless of the merit of such claim responding to infringement claim can be expensive and time consuming if ge is found to infringe any third party right we could be required to pay substantial damage or we could be enjoined from offering some of our product and service the value of or our ability to use our intellectual property may also be negatively impacted by dependency on third party such our ability to obtain or renew on reasonable term license that we need in the future or our ability to secure or retain ownership or right to use data in certain software analytics or service offering operational risk operational risk relates to risk arising from system process people and external event that affect the operation of our business it includes risk related to product and service life cycle and execution product safety and performance information management and data protection and security including cybersecurity and supply chain and business disruption operational execution we may face operational challenge that could have material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and result of operation the company financial result depend on the successful execution of our business operating plan across all step of the product and service development production marketing sale servicing and cash collection lifecycle for example we are working to improve the operation and execution of our power business and our ability to effect an operational turnaround will be significant factor in determining the financial performance of the company whole in addition we have dependency on the continued strength of our aviation business and it successful plan execution because of both the continued weakness in power well the planned disposition that will result in our portfolio of business earnings and source of operating cash flow becoming le diversified organizational change including result of restructuring action that lead to employee attrition or declining labor relation could adversely affect our ability to manage operational challenge operational failure could result in quality problem or potential product labor safety or environmental risk which could have material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and result of operation in addition portion of our business particularly within our power and renewable energy business involves large project where we take on the full scope of engineering procurement construction or other service these type of project can pose unique risk related to their scale complexity and duration performance issue can arise due to inadequate technical expertise development at project site environmental health and safety issue execution by subcontractor or consortium partner and compliance with government regulation and can lead to cost overrun contractual penalty liquidated damage and other adverse consequence the company portfolio evolves to the extent that such project represent larger share of ge business than they did in the past the risk will become greater that operational quality or other issue at particular project could adversely affect ge business reputation or result of operation product safety our product and service are highly sophisticated and specialized and major product failure or similar event could adversely affect our business reputation financial position and result of operation we produce highly sophisticated product and provide specialized service for both our and third party product that incorporate or use complex or leading edge technology including both hardware and software many of our product and service involve complex industrial machinery or infrastructure project such commercial jet engine gas turbine offshore oil and gas drilling or nuclear power generation and accordingly the impact of catastrophic product failure or similar event could be significant in particular actual or perceived design or production issue related to new product introduction or relatively new product line can result in significant reputational harm to our business in addition to direct warranty maintenance and other cost that may arise and more significant product issue resulting in widespread outage fleet grounding or similar systemic consequence could have material adverse effect on our business financial position and result of operation while we have built operational process to ensure that our product design manufacture performance and servicing meet rigorous quality standard there can be no assurance that we or our customer or other third party will not experience operational process or product failure and other problem including through manufacturing or design defect process or other failure of contractor or third party supplier cyber attack or other intentional act that could result in potential product safety regulatory or environmental risk ge form risk factor cybersecurity increased cybersecurity requirement vulnerability threat and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose risk to our system network product solution service and data increased global cybersecurity vulnerability threat computer virus and more sophisticated and targeted cyber related attack well cybersecurity failure resulting from human error and technological error pose risk to the security of ge and it customer partner supplier and third party service provider product system and network and the confidentiality availability and integrity of ge and it customer data the perpetrator of such attack become more capable and critical infrastructure is increasingly becoming digitized the risk in this area continue to grow while we attempt to mitigate these risk by employing number of measure including employee training monitoring and testing and maintenance of protective system and contingency plan we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threat and there is no assurance that the impact from such threat will not be material in addition to existing risk the adoption of new technology may also increase our exposure to cybersecurity breach and failure we also may have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information in certain of our business that is subject to privacy and security law regulation or customer imposed control despite our use of reasonable and appropriate control to protect our system and sensitive confidential or personal data or information we may be vulnerable to material security breach theft misplaced lost or corrupted data programming error employee error and or malfeasance including misappropriation by departing employee that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our system software solution or network unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective product production downtime and operational disruption data privacy and protection law are evolving can vary significantly by country and present increasing compliance challenge which increase our cost affect our competitiveness and can expose to substantial fine or other penalty in addition cyber related attack could result in other negative consequence including damage to our reputation or competitiveness remediation or increased protection cost litigation or regulatory action supply chain significant raw material shortage supplier capacity constraint supplier production disruption supplier quality and sourcing issue or price increase could increase our operating cost and adversely impact the competitive position of our product our reliance on third party supplier contract manufacturer and service provider and commodity market to secure raw material part component and sub system used in our product expose to volatility in the price and availability of these material part component system and service some of these supplier or their sub supplier are limited or sole source supplier we also have internal dependency on certain key ge manufacturing or other facility disruption in delivery from key ge facility or from our third party supplier contract manufacturer or outsourced or other service provider capacity constraint production disruption price increase or decreased availability of raw material or commodity including result of catastrophic or other business continuity event could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitment to customer or increase our operating cost quality capability and sourcing issue experienced by third party provider can also adversely affect our cost margin rate and the quality and effectiveness of our product and service and result in liability and reputational harm in addition while we require our supplier to implement and maintain reasonable and appropriate control to protect information we provide to them they may be the victim of cyber related attack that could potentially lead to the compromise of the company intellectual property or other confidential information or to production downtime and operational disruption that could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitment to customer financial risk financial risk relates to our ability to meet financial obligation and mitigate exposure to broad market risk including funding and liquidity risk such risk related to our credit rating and our availability and cost of funding credit risk and volatility in foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and commodity price liquidity risk refers to the potential inability to meet contractual or contingent financial obligation whether on or off balance sheet they arise and could potentially impact an institution financial condition or overall safety and soundness credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from customer or counterparty failure to meet it contractual obligation and we face credit risk arising from both our industrial business and from ge capital leverage borrowing our indebtedness level could limit the flexibility of our business and we could face further constraint result of failing to decrease our leverage over time further downgrade of our credit rating or adverse market condition our ability to decrease our leverage planned is dependent on the proceeds that we generate from business and asset disposition well our cash flow from operation de leveraging and servicing our debt will require significant amount of cash and if we are unable to generate cash flow in accordance with our plan we may be required to adopt one or more alternative such increasing borrowing under credit line further reducing or delaying investment or capital expenditure selling other business or asset refinancing debt or raising additional equity capital our indebtedness could put at competitive disadvantage compared to competitor with lower debt level that may have greater financial flexibility to secure additional funding for their operation pursue strategic acquisition finance long term project or take other action continuing to have substantial indebtedness could also have the consequence of increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry specific condition or to increase in the capital or liquidity need at the ge or ge capital level and it could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to change in the economy and the industry in which we compete ge form risk factor in addition our existing level of indebtedness may impair our ability to obtain additional debt financing on favorable term in the future particularly if coupled with further downgrade of our credit rating or deterioration of capital market condition more generally external condition in the financial and credit market may limit the availability of funding at particular time or increase the cost of funding which could adversely affect our business financial position and result of operation factor that may affect the availability of funding or cause an increase in our funding cost include disruption in the funding market and potential market impact arising in the united state europe china or emerging market currency movement or other potential market disruption if our cost of funding were to increase it may adversely affect our competitive position and result in lower net interest margin earnings and cash flow well lower return on shareowner equity and invested capital liquidity failure to meet our cash flow target or additional credit downgrade could adversely affect our liquidity funding cost and related margin we rely on cash from operation and proceeds from business and asset disposition well access to the short and long term debt market to fund our operation maintain liquidity and meet our financial obligation and capital allocation priority in particular we have historically relied on significant short term borrowing in the commercial paper market to fund our operation on an intra quarter basis if we do not meet our cash flow objective whether through improved cash performance in our business or successful execution of disposition and other portfolio action our financial condition could be adversely affected our access to the debt market and to the commercial paper market in particular depends on our credit rating result of fourth quarter rating action by moody and fitch ge ha transitioned to tier commercial paper issuer which reduced our borrowing capacity in the commercial paper market to accommodate ge short term liquidity need we are increasing utilization of our revolving credit facility which will result in an overall increase to our cost of fund significant increase in our cost of capital could require to consider change to our capital allocation plan such our planned dividend level there can also be no assurance that we will not face additional credit downgrade result of factor such our progress in decreasing our leverage the performance of our business the failure to execute on disposition and other portfolio action or change in rating application or methodology future downgrade could further adversely affect our cost of fund and related margin liquidity competitive position and access to capital market and significant downgrade could have an adverse commercial impact on our industrial business for example if our short term credit rating were to fall below we would no longer have access to the tier commercial paper market and therefore our borrowing capacity in the commercial paper market would likely be further reduced further we have relied and may continue to rely on securitization program to provide alternative funding for sale of ge receivables to third party investor if any of our short term credit rating were to fall below the timing or amount of liquidity generated by these program could be adversely affected in addition in certain securitization transaction where we provide servicing for third party investor we are contractually permitted to commingle cash collected from customer on financing receivables sold or pledged to third party investor with our own cash prior to making required payment to third party investor provided our short term credit rating doe not fall below in the event our rating were to fall below such level we would be required to segregate certain of these cash collection owed to third party investor into restricted bank account and would lose the short term liquidity benefit of commingling with respect to such collection in addition under various debt and derivative instrument guarantee and covenant we could be required to post additional capital or collateral in the event of rating downgrade which would increase the impact of rating downgrade on our liquidity and capital position swap forward and option contract are executed under standard master agreement that typically contain mutual downgrade provision that provide the ability of the counterparty to require termination if the credit rating of the applicable ge entity were to fall below specified rating level agreed upon with the counterparty primarily bbb for additional discussion about our current credit rating and related consideration refer to the capital resource and liquidity credit rating and condition section of this report ge form risk factor economy customer counterparties deterioration in condition in the global economy the major industry we serve or the financial market or in the soundness of financial institution government or customer we deal with may adversely affect our business and result of operation the business and operating result of our industrial business have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic condition including condition in the air transportation power generation oil and gas renewables healthcare and other major industry we serve existing or potential customer may delay or cancel plan to purchase our product and service including large infrastructure project and may not be able to fulfill their obligation to in timely fashion result of business deterioration cash flow shortage low oil price or difficulty obtaining financing due to macroeconomic condition geopolitical disruption change in law or other unexpected challenge affecting the strength of the global economy the airline industry for example is highly cyclical and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the and international economy an extended disruption of regional or international travel such disruption following terrorist incident or recessionary economic environment that result in the loss of business and leisure traffic could have material adverse effect on our airline customer and the viability of their business such effect would be particularly significant for ge in the current environment in which we have dependency on the continued strength of our aviation business we execute on planned disposition and our overall portfolio of business earnings and source of operating cash flow becomes le diversified service contract cancellation or customer dynamic such early aircraft retirement reduced demand in our power business result of increased market penetration by renewables and other secular or cyclical pressure reduced demand in the wind energy market from the elimination of production or other tax credit for new wind project or decline in order project commencement delay and pricing pressure at bhge from low oil price could affect our ability to fully recover our contract cost and estimated earnings in particular our ability to effect an operational turnaround in our power business will be more challenging to the extent that market for our product and service remain lower for longer than expected further our vendor may experience similar condition which may impact their ability to fulfill their obligation to we may also face greater challenge collecting on receivables with customer that are sovereign government or located in emerging market if there is significant deterioration in the global economy our result of operation financial position and cash flow could be materially adversely affected ge capital smaller ge capital continues to have exposure to insurance credit and other risk and in the event of future adverse development may not be able to meet it business and financial objective without further action at ge capital or additional capital contribution by ge to fund the statutory capital contribution that it expects to make to it insurance subsidiary over the next several year well to meet it other obligation ge capital plan to rely on it existing liquidity cash flow from it business and generating additional cash through disposition including substantially reducing the size of it energy financial service and industrial finance business we are also planning approximately billion of capital contribution from ge to ge capital in however ge capital excess liquidity from past disposition proceeds run off and future earnings may be reduced result of business or other asset sale the risk will increase that future adverse development could cause liquidity or funding stress for ge capital for example it is possible that future requirement for capital contribution to the insurance subsidiary will be greater than currently estimated or could be accelerated by regulator for example if our annual testing of insurance reserve result in premium deficiency we are required to unlock and update the assumption for our future policy benefit reserve and any future adverse change to these assumption to the extent not offset by any favorable change to these assumption could result in an increase to future policy benefit reserve and potentially to the amount of capital we are required to contribute to the insurance subsidiary we anticipate that the adoption of recent change to insurance accounting standard discussed in the other item new accounting standard section within md will also materially affect our financial statement in addition we continue to evaluate strategic option to accelerate the further reduction in the size of ge capital certain of these option could have material financial charge depending on the timing negotiated term and condition of any ultimate arrangement it is also possible that contingent liability and loss estimate from ge capital continuing or discontinued operation will need to be recognized or will increase in the future and will become payable if ge capital credit rating are downgraded because of inadequate increase in it capital level over time change in rating application or methodology or other factor ge capital may also face increased interest cost and limitation on it ability to access external funding in the future we anticipate funding any insurance capital requirement or strategic option through combination of ge capital earnings asset sale liquidity and ge parent support ge capital also ha exposure to many different industry and counterparties including sovereign government and routinely executes transaction with counterparties in the financial service industry including broker and dealer commercial bank investment bank and other institutional client many of these transaction expose ge capital to credit risk in the event of default of it counterparty or client if condition in the financial market deteriorate they may adversely affect the business and result of operation of ge capital well the soundness of financial institution government and other counterparties we deal with in addition ge capital credit risk may be increased when the value of collateral held can not be realized through sale or is liquidated at price insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to it there can be no assurance that future liability loss or impairment to the carrying value of financial asset would not materially and adversely affect ge capital business financial position result of operation and capacity to provide financing to support order from ge industrial business or that factor causing sufficiently severe stress at ge capital would not require ge to make larger than expected capital contribution to ge capital in the future ge form risk factor social cost sustained increase in pension and healthcare benefit cost may reduce our profitability our result of operation may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit pension plan gaap requires that we calculate income or expense for the plan using actuarial valuation these valuation reflect assumption about financial market and other economic condition which may change based on change in key economic indicator the most significant year end assumption we use to estimate pension expense for are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on the plan asset in addition we are required to make an annual measurement of plan asset and liability which may result in significant reduction or increase to equity at the end of the ge pension plan wa underfunded on gaap basis by billion and the ge supplementary pension plan an unfunded plan had projected benefit obligation of billion we made contribution of billion to the ge pension plan in the contribution satisfy our minimum erisa funding requirement of billion and the remaining billion wa voluntary contribution to the plan portion of which will be used to satisfy our minimum erisa funding requirement for although gaap expense and pension funding contribution are not directly related key economic factor that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would contribute to pension plan required under erisa failure to achieve expected return on plan asset driven by various factor which could include continued environment of low interest rate or sustained market volatility could also result in an increase to the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plan in addition there may be upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare benefit to current employee and retiree although we have actively sought to control increase in these cost there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increase and continued upward pressure could reduce our profitability for discussion regarding how our financial statement can be affected by our pension and healthcare benefit obligation see the other consolidated information postretirement benefit plan section within md and note to the consolidated financial statement see also the critical accounting estimate pension assumption section within md for discussion regarding how our financial statement can be affected by our pension plan accounting policy legal compliance risk legal and compliance risk relates to risk arising from the government and regulatory environment and action and from legal proceeding and compliance with integrity policy and procedure including those relating to financial reporting environmental health and safety government and regulatory risk includes the risk that the government or regulatory action will impose additional cost on or require to make adverse change to our business model or practice regulatory we are subject to wide variety of law regulation and government policy that may change in significant way our business are subject to regulation under wide variety of federal and state and non law regulation and policy there can be no assurance that law regulation and policy will not be changed in way that will require to modify our business model and objective or affect our return on investment by restricting existing activity and product subjecting them to escalating cost or prohibiting them outright in particular legislative regulatory or other area of significance for our business that and non government have focused and continue to focus on include cybersecurity data privacy and sovereignty trade control and compliance with complex economic sanction improper payment competition law foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility currency control that could restrict the movement of liquidity from particular jurisdiction tariff on import and export in the or other country and potential further change to tax law including additional guidance concerning the enactment of tax reform may have an effect on ge ge capital or other regulated subsidiary structure operation sale liquidity capital requirement effective tax rate and performance for example legislative or regulatory measure by state or non government in response to the recent federal tax reform or otherwise or rule and interpretation under the new tax law could increase our cost or tax rate in addition effort by public and private sector to control the growth of healthcare cost may lead to lower reimbursement and increased utilization control related to the use of our product by healthcare provider regulation or government scrutiny may impact the requirement for marketing our product and slow our ability to

revenue from the sale of equipmentperformance obligation satisfied over time we recognize revenue on agreement for the sale of customized good including power generation equipment larger oil drilling equipment project military development contract locomotive unit and long term construction project on an over time basis we recognize revenue using percentage of completion based on cost incurred relative to total expected cost our estimate of cost to be incurred to fulfill our promise to customer is based on our history of manufacturing or constructing similar asset for customer and is updated routinely to reflect change in quantity or pricing of the input we recognize revenue we customize the customer equipment during the manufacturing or integration process and obtain right to payment for work performed we provide for potential loss on any of these agreement when it is probable that we will incur the loss our billing term for these over time contract vary but are generally based on achieving specified milestone the difference between the timing of our revenue recognized based on cost incurred and customer billing based on contractual term result in change to our contract asset or contract liability position see note for further information performance obligation satisfied at point in time we recognize revenue on agreement for non customized equipment including commercial aircraft engine healthcare equipment resource extraction equipment and other good we manufacture on standardized basis for sale to the market at point in time we recognize revenue at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the good which is generally no earlier than when the customer ha physical possession of the product we use proof of delivery for certain large equipment with more complex logistics whereas the delivery of other equipment is estimated based on historical average of in transit period time between shipment and delivery in situation where arrangement include customer acceptance provision based on seller or customer specified objective criterion we recognize revenue when we have concluded that the customer ha control of the good and that acceptance is likely to occur we generally do not provide for anticipated loss on point in time transaction prior to transferring control of the equipment to the customer our billing term for these point in time equipment contract vary and generally coincide with delivery to the customer however within certain business we receive progress payment from customer for large equipment purchase which is generally to reserve production slot revenue from the sale of service consistent with our discussion in the md and the way we manage our business we refer to sale under service agreement and sale of both good such spare part and equipment upgrade and related service such monitoring maintenance and repair sale of service which is an important part of our operation performance obligation satisfied over timewe enter into long term service agreement with our customer primarily within our aviation power oil gas and transportation segment these agreement require to provide preventative maintenance overhaul and standby warranty type service that include certain level of assurance regarding asset performance and uptime throughout the contract period which generally range from to year we account for item that are integral to the maintenance of the equipment part of our service related performance obligation unless the customer ha substantive right to make separate purchasing decision equipment upgrade we recognize revenue we perform under the arrangement using percentage of completion based on cost incurred relative to total expected cost throughout the life of contract this measure of progress capture the nature timing and extent of our underlying performance activity our stand ready service often fluctuate between routine inspection and maintenance unscheduled service event and major overhaul at pre determined usage interval we provide for potential loss on any of these agreement when it is probable that we will incur the loss contract modification that extend or revise contract term are not uncommon and generally result in our recognizing the impact of the revised term prospectively over the remaining life of the modified contract effectively like new contract our billing term for these arrangement are generally based on the utilization of the asset per hour of usage or upon the occurrence of major maintenance event within the contract such an overhaul the difference between the timing of our revenue recognized based on cost incurred and customer billing based on contractual term result in change to our contract asset or contract liability position see note for further information ge form financial statementsnotes to consolidated financial statement change in customer utilization can influence the timing and extent of overhaul and other service event over the life of the contract result the revenue recognized each period is dependent on our estimate of how customer will utilize their asset over the term of the agreement we generally use combination of both historical utilization trend well forward looking information such market condition and potential asset retirement in developing our revenue estimate this estimate of customer utilization will impact both the total contract billing and cost to satisfy our obligation to maintain the equipment in developing our cost estimate we utilize combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvement cost improvement are generally only included in future cost estimate after saving have been observed in actual result or proven to be effective through an extensive regulatory engineering approval process we also enter into long term service agreement in our healthcare and renewable energy segment revenue are recognized for these arrangement on straight line basis consistent with the nature timing and extent of our service which primarily relate to routine maintenance and needed product repair our billing term for these contract vary but we generally invoice periodically service are provided performance obligation satisfied at point in timewe sell certain tangible product largely spare equipment through our service business we recognize revenue and bill our customer for this equipment at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the good which is at the point in time we deliver the spare part to the customer ge capital revenue from service earned income we use the interest method to recognize income on loan interest on loan includes origination commitment and other non refundable fee related to funding recorded in earned income on the interest method we stop accruing interest at the earlier of the time at which collection of an account becomes doubtful or the account becomes day past due previously recognized interest income that wa accrued but not collected from the borrower is reversed unless the term of the loan agreement permit capitalization of accrued interest to the principal balance payment received on nonaccrual loan are applied to reduce the principal balance of the loan we resume accruing interest on nonaccrual loan only when payment are brought current according to the loan original term and future payment are reasonably assured we recognize financing lease income on the interest method to produce level yield on fund not yet recovered estimated unguaranteed residual value are based upon management best estimate of the value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term we use various source of data in determining these estimate including information obtained from third party which is adjusted for the attribute of the specific asset under lease guarantee of residual value by unrelated third party are included within minimum lease payment significant assumption we use in estimating residual value include estimated net cash flow over the remaining lease term anticipated result of future remarketing and estimated future component part and scrap metal price discounted at an appropriate rate we recognize operating lease income on straight line basis over the term of underlying lease business and asset held for salebusinesses and asset held for sale represent component that meet accounting requirement to be classified held for sale and are presented single asset and liability amount in our financial statement with valuation allowance if necessary to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fair value le cost to sell financing receivables that no longer qualify to be presented held for investment must be classified asset held for sale and recognized in our financial statement at the lower of cost or fair value le cost to sell with that amount representing new cost basis at the date of transfer the determination of fair value for business and asset held for sale involves significant judgment and assumption development of estimate of fair value in this circumstance is complex and is dependent upon among other factor the nature of the potential sale transaction for example asset sale versus sale of legal entity composition of asset and or business in the disposal group the comparability of the disposal group to market transaction and negotiation with third party purchaser such factor bear directly on the range of potential fair value and the selection of the best estimate key assumption were developed based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participant would use in hypothetical transaction we review all business and asset held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amount are fully recoverable in comparison to estimated fair value le cost to sell depreciation and amortizationthe cost of ge

financing receivablesour financing receivables portfolio consists of variety of loan and lease including both larger balance non homogeneous loan and lease and smaller balance homogeneous loan and lease we routinely evaluate our entire portfolio for potential specific credit or collection issue that might indicate an impairment loss on financing receivables are recognized when they are incurred which requires to make our best estimate of probable loss inherent in the portfolio the method for calculating the best estimate of loss depends on the size type and risk characteristic of the related financing receivable such an estimate requires consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current condition and judgment about the probable effect of relevant observable data including present economic condition such delinquency rate financial health of specific customer and market sector collateral value and the present and expected future level of interest rate the underlying assumption estimate and assessment we use to provide for loss are updated periodically to reflect our view of current condition change in such estimate can significantly affect the allowance and

certain asset within our pension plan and retiree benefit plan for financial asset and liability measured at fair value on recurring basis fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer liability in an orderly transaction with market participant at the measurement date in the absence of active market for the identical asset or liability such measurement involve developing assumption based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participant would use in hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date observable input reflect market data obtained from independent source while unobservable input reflect our market assumption preference is given to observable input these two type of input create the following fair value hierarchy level quoted price for identical instrument in active market level quoted price for similar instrument in active market quoted price for identical or similar instrument in market that are not active and model derived valuation whose input are observable or whose significant value driver are observable level significant input to the valuation model are unobservable we maintain policy and procedure to value instrument using the best and most relevant data available in addition we have risk management team that review valuation including independent price validation for certain instrument with regard to level valuation including instrument valued by third party we perform variety of procedure to ass the reasonableness of the valuation such review include an evaluation of instrument whose fair value change exceeds predefined threshold and or doe not change and consider the current interest rate currency and credit

include publicly traded equity security for large number of debt security for which market price are observable for identical or similar investment security but not readily accessible for each of those investment individually that is it is difficult to obtain pricing information for each individual investment security at the measurement date we obtain pricing information from an independent pricing vendor the pricing vendor us various pricing model for each asset class that are consistent with what other market participant would use the input and assumption to the model of the pricing

market observable information these investment are included in level and primarily comprise our portfolio of corporate fixed income and government mortgage and asset backed security our pricing vendor may provide with valuation that are based on significant unobservable input and in those circumstance we classify the investment security in level annually we conduct review of our primary pricing vendor to validate that the input used in that vendor pricing process are deemed to be market observable defined in the standard while we are not provided access to proprietary model of the vendor our review have included on site walk throughs of the pricing process methodology and control procedure for each asset class and level for which price are provided our review also include an examination of the underlying input and assumption for sample of individual security across asset class credit rating level and various duration in addition the pricing vendor ha an established challenge process in place for all security valuation which facilitates identification and resolution of potentially erroneous price we believe that the price received from our pricing vendor are representative of price that would be received to sell the asset at the measurement date exit price and are classified appropriately in the hierarchy we use non binding broker quote and other third party pricing service our primary basis for valuation when there is limited or no relevant market activity for specific instrument or for other instrument that share similar characteristic we have not adjusted the price we have obtained investment security priced using non binding broker quote and other third party pricing service are included in level is the case with our primary pricing vendor third party broker and other third party pricing service do not provide access to their proprietary valuation model input and assumption accordingly we conduct review of vendor applicable similar to the review performed of our primary pricing vendor in addition we conduct internal review of pricing for all such investment security quarterly to ensure reasonableness of valuation used in our financial statement these review are designed to identify price that appear stale those that have changed significantly from prior valuation and other anomaly that may indicate that price may not be accurate

reporting comprehensive income topic reclassification of certain tax effect from accumulated other comprehensive income the asu provides that the stranded tax effect from the tax cut and job act tax reform on the balance of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci may be reclassified to retained earnings the stranded tax effect relate primarily to pension and other employee benefit plan and absent the asu our policy is to release stranded tax effect on plan termination we elected to early adopt the standard and reclassified the tax effect recorded within aoci associated primarily with the change in tax rate under tax reform to retained earnings the adoption resulted in decrease to aoci and an increase to retained earnings of million on january we adopted asu revenue from contract with customer and the related amendment asc which supersedes most previous gaap revenue guidance we elected to adopt the new standard on retrospective basis to ensure consistent basis of presentation within our consolidated financial statement for all period reported in addition we elected the practical expedient for contract modification which essentially mean that the term of the contract that existed at the beginning of the earliest period presented can be assumed to have been in place since the inception of the contract not practical to separately evaluate the effect of all prior contract modification asc requires company to identify contractual performance obligation and determine whether revenue should be recognized at point in time or over time based on when control of good and service transfer to customer result of the adoption of the standard we recorded significant change in the timing of revenue recognition and in the classification between revenue and cost the financial statement effect of the adoption wa decrease to our previously reported retained earnings of january of million and decrease to our previously reported revenue and earnings loss from continuing operation of million and million respectively for the year ended december and million and million respectively for the year ended december the effect on our consolidated statement of financial position wa principally comprised of change to our contract asset inventory deferred tax deferred income and progress collection balance resulting in an million decrease to previously reported total asset of december discussed in prior filing the impact of adopting the asc includes long term service agreement for our long term service agreement we will continue to recognize revenue over time using percentage of completion based on cost incurred relative to total expected cost we will also continue to record cumulative effect adjustment resulting from change to our estimated contract billing or cost excluding those resulting from contract modification discussed below our accounting wa impacted by various change in the new revenue standard including accounting for contract modification and their related impact and change in the accounting scope and term of our contract ge form financial statementsnotes to consolidated financial statement modification under the new revenue standard contract modification are generally accounted for if we entered into new contract resulting in prospective recognition of change to our estimate of contract billing and cost that is cumulative effect adjustment will generally no longer be recognized in the period that modification occur there wa limited guidance for accounting for contract modification under prior gaap result our previous method of accounting for contract modification wa developed with the objective of accounting for the nature of the contract modification generally contract modification were accounted for cumulative effect adjustment which reflected an update to the contract margin for the impact of the modification change to estimate of future contract billing and cost however modification that substantially changed the economics of the arrangement were effectively accounted for new contract scope and term the new revenue standard provides more prescriptive guidance on identifying the element of long term service type contract that should be accounted for separate performance obligation application of this guidance which focus on understanding the nature of the arrangement including our customer discretion in purchasing decision ha resulted in change to the scope of element included in our accounting model for long term service agreement for example significant equipment upgrade offered part of our long term service agreement are generally accounted for separate performance obligation under the new revenue standard also the term of our contract is now defined the shorter of the stated term or the term not subject to customer termination without substantive penalty over this contract term we estimate our revenue and related cost including estimate of fixed and variable payment related to asset utilization and related cost to fulfill our performance obligation historically our accounting for long term contract did not reflect an expectation that contract would be terminated prior to the stated term particularly when the probability of termination wa considered remote under prior gaap while termination right were considered more emphasis wa placed on expected outcome use of best estimate for example we used historical experience with similar type of contract well other evidence customer intent economic compulsion and future plan for operating the asset to determine the contract term for application of our accounting model these change to our long term service agreement accounting have significantly impacted all of our industrial business except for renewable energy healthcare and lighting and were some of the driver in the reduction of the related contract asset balance of million of december while these contract asset balance have been reduced due to the accounting change the economics and cash impact of these contract remain unchanged aviation commercial engine for aviation commercial engine our previous method applied contract specific estimated margin rate which included the effect of estimated cost improvement over time to cost incurred to determine the amount of revenue that should be recognized the new revenue standard resulted in significant change from our previous long term contract accounting model while we will continue to recognize revenue at delivery each engine is now accounted for separate performance obligation reflecting the contractually stated price and manufacturing cost of each engine the most significant effect of this change is on our new engine launch where the cost of earlier production unit is higher than the cost of later production unit driven by expected cost improvement over the life of the engine program which generally resulted in lower earnings or increased loss on our early program engine delivery to our customer the effect of this change reduced the related contract asset balance by million of december all other large equipment for the remainder of our equipment business the new revenue standard emphasis on transfer of control rather than risk and reward ha resulted in an accelerated timing of revenue recognition versus our previous accounting for certain product while this change impact all our business our renewable energy business wa most significantly impacted on year over year basis with certain of their product recognized at an earlier point in time compared to historical standard our policy under asc wa to defer recognition until all risk had transferred to the customer which wa generally upon product installation or customer acceptance for these equipment contract the customer ha control of the equipment in advance of the related installation or acceptance event based on our evaluation of the indicator provided in asc consistent with our industry peer certain of our business product have transitioned either to point in time or over time recognition based on the nature of the arrangement this change in timing of revenue had an effect on inventory contract asset and progress collection to reflect the transfer of control at an earlier point in time on january we adopted asu no compensation retirement benefit topic improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost the asu requires the service cost component of the net periodic cost for pension and postretirement plan to be presented in the same line item in the statement of earnings other employee related compensation cost the non service related cost are now required to be presented separately from the service cost component this change to our consolidated statement of earnings loss ha been reflected on retrospective basis and had no effect on continuing or net income the new standard also added guidance requiring entity to exclude these non service related cost from capitalization in inventory or other internally developed asset on prospective basis which did not have significant effect ge form financial statementsnotes to consolidated financial statement on january we adopted asu no statement of cash flow restricted cash the asu requires the change in the total of cash and restricted cash to be presented in the statement of cash flow in addition when cash and restricted cash are presented on separate line on the balance sheet an entity is required to reconcile the total in the statement of cash flow to the related line item in the balance sheet while not direct effect of the adoption of the standard to simplify the reconciliation of the statement of cash flow to the cash balance presented in our consolidated statement of financial position we have elected to present cash and restricted cash single line on the balance sheet which resulted in an increase of million and million to our previously reported december and december cash balance respectively the change to our cash balance and cash flow ha been reflected on retrospective basis for all period presented on january we adopted asu no accounting for income tax intra entity asset transfer of asset other than inventory the asu eliminates the deferral of the tax effect of intra entity asset transfer other than inventory and wa required to be adopted on modified retrospective basis result the tax expense from the intercompany sale of asset other than inventory and associated change to deferred tax will be recognized when the sale occurs even though the pre tax effect of the transaction have not been recognized they are eliminated in consolidation this change to our income tax provision ha been reflected million cumulative catch up adjustment to increase retained earnings of january and is not reflected in period prior to this date on january we adopted asu no statement of cash flow classification of certain cash receipt and cash payment the asu is required to be reflected on retrospective basis and provides guidance on the classification of certain cash receipt and cash payment including requiring payment received on beneficial interest in securitization transaction be classified investing activity our ge industrial business sell whole current receivables to ge capital in normal course sale transaction and report those transaction operating cash flow in the ge statement of cash flow in contrast ge capital in one of it receivables facility sell current receivables daily to third party predominantly commercial paper conduit for cash and beneficial interest in the previously sold receivables the deferred purchase price or dpp ge capital report all cash flow associated with the purchase and sale of current receivables from the ge industrial business investing cash flow on consolidated basis we eliminate the transaction between ge and ge capital and account only for the external transaction and the resulting dpp therefore we recorded the adoption impact in our consolidated statement of cash flow in adopting the asu we determined the investing cash flow associated with the dpp based on the contractual payment on the dpp that we received monthly and reclassified million and million from cash inflow from operating activity to cash inflow from investing activity for the year ended december and respectively in our consolidated statement of cash flow in the third quarter of we learned of an interpretation of the asu that requires daily computation of both non cash activity and cash flow associated with the dpp when receivables are sold daily that is different from the monthly computation of the dpp we used in our previously reported accounting which wa based on the timing of settlement we completed our evaluation of this interpretation in the fourth quarter of and determined that change in the method of presenting our cash flow in manner consistent with this interpretation required to reclassify an incremental million and million from cash inflow from operating activity to cash inflow from investing activity for the year ended december and respectively in our consolidated statement of cash flow in december we modified the term of the receivables facility affected so that future sale of receivables will occur at each monthly settlement date opposed to daily there wa no change to the economic term of the arrangement result of this modification the million and million reclassification described above were consequence of the timing difference between our daily sale and the monthly settlement the renegotiated term remove this timing difference accordingly in future period applying the asu to the revised term will result in our calculating consolidated cash flow in manner similar to those reported prior to the incremental reclassification described above on january we adopted asu financial instrument overall subtopic recognition and measurement of financial asset and financial liability the asu requires that equity investment with readily determinable fair value except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting will be measured at fair value with change in fair value recognized in earnings the adoption had an insignificant impact to retained earnings and other comprehensive income ge form financial statementsnotes to consolidated financial statement effective january we voluntarily changed the cost method of the ge inventory that were previously measured on last in first out lifo basis to first in first out fifo basis we believe the fifo method is preferable measure for our inventory it is expected to better reflect the current value of inventory reported in our consolidated statement of financial position improve the matching of cost of good sold with related revenue and provide for greater consistency and uniformity across our operation with respect to the method of inventory valuation while this change will also require to make conforming change for income tax purpose all ge business previously using lifo are expected to be in deflationary cost environment due to the manufacturing life cycle of the product and continuous reduction in the manufacturing cost due to better efficiency which would significantly decrease the tax benefit that lifo would otherwise provide prior to the change and reported in our annual report on form lifo wa used for approximately of ge inventory of december required by gaap we have reflected this change in accounting principle on retrospective basis resulting in change to thehistorical period presented the retrospective application of the change resulted in decrease to our january retainedearnings of million and decrease to our result from continuing operation by million and million for the year ended december and december respectively this change did not affect our previously reported cash flow from operating investing

class shareholder the noncontrolling interest is recorded at fair value for the portion attributable to baker hughes and at our historical cost for the portion attributable to ge oil gas the fair value of the noncontrolling interest associated with the acquired net asset wa determined by the publicly traded share price of baker hughes at the close of the transaction the impact of recognizing the noncontrolling interest in ge oil gas resulted in an increase to additional paid in capital of million in the prior year we disclosed that the impact of recognizing the noncontrolling interest wa decrease to additional paid in capital of million the primary reason for the change from prior year is the adoption of asc in the first quarter of the table below present the fair value of the

asset acquired and liability assumed in million july cash and cash equivalent plant and equipment intangible asset other payable borrowing deferred tax all other liability total identifiable net asset value of existing noncontrolling interest goodwill allocated purchase price includes an increase of approximately million primarily related to fair value adjustment to identifiable asset and liability excluding goodwill partially offset by tax asset of approximately million associated with the recognition of foreign tax credit through the end of the purchase accounting window in measurement period adjustment increased goodwill by million primarily due to reduction in the fair value of property plant and equipment of million equity method investment of million intangible asset of million and an increase to other liability of million partially offset by deferred tax adjustment of million certain of these adjustment resulted in cumulative decrease to depreciation and amortization expense of million in addition we reclassified certain legacy baker hughes business balance to conform to our presentation goodwill represents future economic benefit expected to be recognized from combining the operation of ge oil gas and baker hughes including expected future synergy and operating efficiency goodwill resulting from the acquisition ha been allocated to our oil gas reporting unit of which

we plan an orderly separation of our ownership interest in bhge over time in november bhge completed an underwritten public offering in which we sold million share of bhge class common stock bhge also repurchased million bhge llc unit from result our economic interest in bhge reduced from to see note for further information goodwill change in goodwill in million balance atjanuary currencyexchangeand otherbalance atdecember atjanuary currencyexchangeand otherbalance atdecember balance decreased primarily result of impairment discussed below the sale of the distributed power business within our power segment and currency effect of stronger dollar partially offset by adjustment to the allocation of purchase price associated with our acquisition of baker hughes and lm wind power we test goodwill for impairment annually in the third quarter of each year using data of july of that year the impairment test consists of two step in step one the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared with it fair value in step two which is applied when the carrying value is more than it fair value the amount of goodwill impairment if any is derived by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit asset and liability from the fair value of it equity and comparing that amount with the carrying amount of goodwill we determined fair value for each of the reporting unit using the market approach when available and appropriate or the income approach or combination of both we ass the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation if multiple valuation methodology are used the result are weighted appropriately valuation using the market approach are derived from metric of publicly traded company or historically completed transaction of comparable business the selection of comparable business is based on the market in which the reporting unit operate giving consideration to risk profile size geography and diversity of product and service market approach is limited to reporting unit for which there are publicly traded company that have the characteristic similar to our business under the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flow discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted rate we use our internal forecast to estimate future cash flow and include an estimate of long term future growth rate based on our most recent view of the long term outlook for each business actual result may differ from those assumed in our forecast we derive our discount rate using capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rate for industry relevant to our reporting unit to estimate the cost of equity financing we use discount rate that are commensurate with the risk and uncertainty inherent in the respective business and in our internally developed forecast discount rate used in our annual reporting unit valuation ranged from to based on the result of our annual impairment test the fair value of each of our reporting unit exceeded their carrying value except for the power generation and grid solution reporting unit within our power segment the majority of the goodwill in our power segment wa recognized result of the alstom acquisition at which time approximately million of goodwill wa attributed to our power generation and grid solution reporting unit previously disclosed the power market well it operating environment continues to be challenging our outlook for power ha continued to deteriorate driven by the significant overcapacity in the industry lower market penetration uncertain timing of deal closure due to deal financing and the complexity of working in emerging market in addition our near term earnings outlook ha been negatively impacted by project execution and our own underlying operational challenge finally market factor such increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy penetration continue to impact our view of long term demand these condition resulted in downward revision of our forecast on current and future projected earnings and cash flow at these business ge form financial statementsnotes to consolidated financial statement therefore we conducted step two of the goodwill impairment test for the power generation and grid solution reporting unit step two requires that we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to identifiable asset and liability of the reporting unit including previously unrecognized intangible asset any residual fair value after this allocation is compared to the goodwill balance and any excess goodwill is charged to expense in performing the second step we identified significant unrecognized intangible asset primarily related to customer relationship backlog technology and trade name the value of these unrecognized intangible asset is driven by high customer retention rate in our power business our contractual backlog the value of internally created technology and the ge trade name the combination of these unrecognized intangible adjustment to the carrying value of other asset and liability and reduced reporting unit fair value calculated in step one resulted in an implied fair value of goodwill substantially below the carrying value of goodwill for the power generation and grid solution reporting unit therefore in the third quarter of we recorded our best estimate of non cash impairment loss of million we recorded the estimated impairment loss in the caption goodwill impairment in our consolidated statement of earnings loss during the fourth quarter of we finalized step two of the impairment analysis and increased the impairment charge by million resulting in final impairment charge of million the impairment loss included million of goodwill recorded at corporate associated with our digital acquisition that wa previously allocated to our power generation and grid solution reporting unit for goodwill testing purpose in the fourth quarter of due to decline in order growth and increased project cost we updated projected cash flow at our hydro reporting unit within our renewable energy segment result of these revised cash flow projection we performed an impairment test of october which resulted in the fair value of our hydro reporting unit to be le than it carrying value therefore we performed step two analysis which resulted in non cash goodwill impairment loss of million we recorded the impairment loss in the caption goodwill impairment in our consolidated statement of earnings loss all of the goodwill in our hydro reporting unit wa recognized result of the alstom acquisition after the impairment charge the fair value of our grid solution and hydro reporting unit were in excess of their carrying value by approximately and respectively while the remaining goodwill at our grid solution and hydro reporting unit is not currently impaired if the power market continue to decline or we do not meet our cash flow forecast there could be an impairment in the future we will continue to monitor the power market and the impact it may have on these reporting unit there is no remaining goodwill associated with our power generation reporting unit in addition the fair value of our additive reporting unit in our aviation segment wa in excess of it carrying value by approximately additive wa formed in fourth quarter of after the acquisition of two business at the time of the acquisition fair value equaled carrying value we will continue to measure our ability to meet our cash flow forecast and to monitor the operating result of the additive business which could impact the fair value of this reporting unit in the future while the fair value of each of the reporting unit in our oil gas segment are in excess of their carrying value our basis in bhge share exceed it publicly traded share price while the goodwill of our oil gas reporting unit is not currently impaired there can be no assurance that further sustained decline in bhge share price or any future decline in macroeconomic or business condition affecting the oil and gas industry will not occur if they were to occur this could result in impairment in future period in the second quarter of we classified significant portion of healthcare equipment finance financing receivables asset held for sale in the fourth quarter of we completed the sale transaction and result we wrote off goodwill of million in our industrial finance reporting unit within our capital segment in we recognized total non cash goodwill impairment loss in our power conversion and energy financial service reporting unit of million and million respectively after the impairment loss there wa no remaining goodwill in our power conversion and our energy financial service reporting unit determining the fair value of reporting unit requires the use of estimate and significant judgment that are based on number of factor

long term care contract utilizing trend observed in our emerging experience for older claimant age and later duration policy certain of our long term care policyholder only recently started to reach the prime claim paying period and our new claim cost assumption considered the emerging credibility of this claim data in addition to the adverse impact from the revised future claim cost projection over long term horizon our premium deficiency assumption considered mortality length of time policy will remain in force and both near term and longer term investment return expectation future investment yield estimated in were lower than in previous premium deficiency test primarily due to the effect of near term yield on approximately million of future expected capital contribution discussed below the capital contribution will be invested at the current market yield which had the impact of lowering the average long term investment yield used to calculate the discount rate and such further adversely impacted the estimated premium deficiency our discount rate assumption for purpose of performing the premium deficiency assessment resulted in weighted average rate of approximately compared to approximately in the test indicated premium deficiency requiring the unlocking of reserve and resetting of actuarial assumption to current assumption this resulted in million pre tax charge to earnings in which included million impairment of deferred acquisition cost million impairment of present value of future profit and an million increase in future policy benefit

experience study based on additional data since the test and considered updated external input based on industry trend and adjustment to assumption result based on this analysis using our most recent future policy benefit reserve assumption we identified premium deficiency which resulted in million pre tax charge to earnings in the increase to future policy benefit reserve wa primarily

legal matter in the normal course of our business we are involved from time to time in various arbitration class action commercial litigation investigation and other legal regulatory or governmental

not party or in two case involving mortgage loan repurchase claim made against rmbs sponsor wmc belief that it ha defense to these demand adverse change to wmc assumption supporting the reserve may result in an increase to these reserve wmc estimate range of reasonably possible loss for all wmc related matter from approximately million to million over it recorded reserve at december this estimate involves significant judgment and may not reflect the range of uncertainty and unpredictable outcome inherent in litigation including the remaining lawsuit discussed in legal proceeding and potential change in wmc legal strategy previously disclosed it is possible that wmc will file for bankruptcy based upon development in the remaining lawsuit and potential legal claim involving wmc in the event of wmc bankruptcy ge capital would be required to reassess it wmc consolidation analysis depending upon the specific fact and circumstance at that time which might result in ge capital no longer consolidating wmc asset and liability in it financial statement in that event ge and ge capital would have to ass their respective direct exposure if any to wmc related loss contingency wmc

consistent with the reserve established the estimation of this reserve involved significant judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainty and unpredictable outcome inherent in litigation and investigation of this nature and at this time we are unable to develop meaningful estimate of the range of reasonably possible additional loss beyond the amount of this reserve damage sought may include disgorgement of profit on the underlying business transaction fine and or penalty interest or other form of resolution factor that can affect the ultimate amount of loss associated with these
