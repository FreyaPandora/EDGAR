marketing and sale of consumer financial product and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial law are supervised and examined by the cfpb which ha broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over provider of credit saving and payment service and product and authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive act or practice in addition number of state have significant consumer credit protection and disclosure law in certain case more stringent than federal law federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practice bankruptcy and debtor relief law can affect our ability to collect amount owed to the review of product and practice to ass compliance and prevent unfair deceptive or abusive conduct will be continuing focus of the cfpb and regulator more broadly well our own internal review for example federal banking regulator have recently announced they are conducting horizontal review of banking sale practice and we are cooperating with regulator in those review in october the company trs centurion bank and american express bank reached settlement with several bank regulator relating to certain aspect of our consumer card practice in december trs centurion bank and american express bank reached settlement with the fdic occ and cfpb to resolve regulatory review of marketing and billing practice related to several credit card add on product internal and regulatory review have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in change to our practice product and procedure substantial restitution to our card member and increased cost related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination such review may also result in additional regulatory action including civil money penalty on may the cfpb issued proposed rule that if enacted would among other change require that our consumer arbitration clause not apply to case filed in court class action unless and until class certification is denied or the class claim are dismissed the cfpb set day period for comment and the rule would become effective day after publication in the federal register and apply to all agreement entered into after that date on july the cfpb outlined proposal

result in final rule if any becoming effective before in the federal financial institution examination council issued guidance on credit card account management and loss allowance practice centurion bank and american express bank regularly evaluate and discus the guidance with their respective regulator and result may refine their practice from time to time based on regulatory input the guidance ha not do we expect it to have any material impact on our business or practice an issuer of stored value prepaid product we are regulated in the united state under the money transmitter or sale of check law in effect in most state we are also required by the law of many state to comply with unclaimed and abandoned property law under which we must pay to state the face amount of any traveler cheque or prepaid card that is uncashed or unredeemed after period of time depending on the type of product in october the cfpb finalized regulatory standard for prepaid card including uniform disclosure certain protection for consumer and other requirement in country outside the united state we have seen an increase in regulatory focus in relation to number of key area impacting our card issuing business particularly consumer protection such the eu the united kingdom and canada responsible lending such australia mexico new zealand and singapore and privacy and data protection such europe australia canada mexico and singapore regulator in number of country are shifting their focus from ensuring compliance with local rule and regulation toward paying greater attention to the product design and operation with focus on customer and outcome regulator expectation of firm in relation to their compliance risk and control framework continue to increase and regulator are placing significant emphasis on firm system and control relating to the identification and resolution of issue table of content payment regulation the operation of card network is subject to increasing focus in various country in which we operate legislator and regulator have focused on the fee merchant pay to accept card including the way bankcard network member collectively set the interchange that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment network like visa and mastercard well the rule contract term and practice governing merchant card acceptance although unlike the visa and mastercard network the american express network doe not have interchange fee or collectively set fee or rule antitrust action and government regulation relating to merchant pricing or term of merchant rule and contract could affect all network directly or indirectly well adversely impact consumer and merchant among other thing lower interchange and or merchant discount revenue can be expected to lead card issuer either to look to reduce cost by scaling back or eliminating reward service or benefit to cardholder and other customer or to look for other source of revenue from consumer such higher annual card fee or interest charge in certain country such certain member state in the eu and australia merchant are permitted by law to surcharge card purchase while surcharging continues to be actively considered in certain jurisdiction the benefit to customer have not been apparent in country that have allowed it and in some case regulator are addressing concern about excessive surcharging by merchant surcharging particularly where it disproportionately impact american express card member which is known differential surcharging well other steering practice that are permitted by regulation in some country could have material adverse effect on if it becomes widespread in addition to the eu payment legislation and the australia payment regulation discussed below we see regulation of the payment industry in other country for example in mexico the central bank adopted rule for the regulation of payment instrument and the authorization of payment clearinghouses including requirement on non discrimination and access however closed loop network such american express are exempt are our licensing arrangement provided that volume under these arrangement fall below certain sector share do currently our gns volume in mexico in canada regulator have prompted the major international card network to make voluntary commitment on pricing specifically interchange fee level in the case of american express our commitment extends to maintaining current pricing practice whereby issuer rate received by gns partner are agreed to bilaterally with each partner rather than multilaterally and merchant pricing is simple transparent and value based with the rate for the acquiring of credit and charge card transaction for particular merchant regardless of the type of card that is presented in malaysia the central bank introduced rule that impose cap on interchange fee permit steering by merchant and co badging of debit card with other card network and require issuer to offer cardholder the option of taking up basic card product with minimal or no cardholder incentive or reward and at zero or nominal cost to the cardholder in some country government have established regulatory regime that require international card network to be locally licensed and or to localize aspect of their operation for example card network operator in india must obtain authorization from the reserve bank of india which ha broad power under the payment and settlement system act to regulate the membership and operation of card network in hong kong the local monetary authority is implementing new regulatory framework under which it is considering which card payment system to designate for supervision in russia card network operator must be authorized by the central bank and newly enacted regulation requires network to place security deposit with the central bank process all local transaction using government owned infrastructure and ensure that local transaction data remains within the country government in some country also provide resource or protection to select domestic payment card network for example china recently adopted new regulation that will permit foreign card network to operate domestically in the country for the first time subject to licensing capital and other requirement the development and enforcement of these and other similar law regulation and policy in international market may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in such country and maintain and extend our global network european union payment legislation in the eu the payment service directive psd adopted in and subsequently implemented by eu member state prescribes common rule across the eu for licensing and supervision of payment service provider including card issuer and merchant acquirer and for their conduct of business with customer the objective of the psd is to facilitate the operation of single internal payment market in the eu through harmonization of eu member state law governing payment service one provision of the psd permit merchant to surcharge subject to disclosure requirement but also allows individual member state to override this rule by prohibiting or limiting surcharging to date the member state are split on whether they prohibit or permit surcharging with country such the united kingdom which for number of year ha permitted it for credit card purchase the netherlands and spain permitting it and other country such france italy and sweden prohibiting it all member state permit merchant to offer discount for particular form of payment the consumer right directive crd prohibits merchant from surcharging card purchase more than the merchant cost of acceptance in those member state that permit surcharging pursuant to the psd the crd provides no guidance to merchant on how to ass the cost of acceptance or take into account the relative value of different payment method cost based limit on surcharging could result in merchant imposing higher surcharge on american express transaction if in the absence of clear guidance surcharging merchant took the position that the cost of american express acceptance is higher than other payment card table of content in the eu adopted legislation in two part covering wide range of topic across the payment industry the first part wa an eu wide regulation on interchange fee the interchange fee regulation the second consisted of revision to the psd the the interchange fee regulation wa formally adopted in april the substantive term adopted include the following price cap interchange fee on consumer card transaction in the eu are capped of december generally at basis point for debit and prepaid card and basis point for credit and charge card with the possibility of lower cap in some instance although we do not have interchange fee and three party network such american express are exempt from the application of the cap the regulation provides that three party network should be treated four party network such visa and mastercard which have interchange fee when they license third party provider to issue card and or acquire merchant or when they issue card with cobrand partner or through an agent this mean for example the cap could be interpreted to apply to element of the financial arrangement agreed to between and each of our gns partner in the eu which may undermine our ability to attract and retain gns partner while the discount rate we agree to with merchant are not capped the interchange cap have exerted and will likely continue to exert downward pressure on merchant fee across the industry including our discount rate we have brought legal challenge and seek ruling from the eu court of justice to clarify the interpretation and validity of the application of price cap well other regulatory measure in circumstance where three party network issue card with cobrand partner or through an agent the interchange fee regulation excludes commercial card transaction from the scope of the cap card acceptance term anti steering and honor all card rule across all card network including non discrimination and honor all card provision in our card acceptance agreement are prohibited with some exception removal of these provision creates significant risk of customer confusion and card member dissatisfaction which would result in harm to the american express brand the prohibition on anti steering rule took effect immediately upon effectiveness of the regulation the prohibition on honor all card rule took effect in june network licensing in december the geographic scope of the network license that we agree to with our gns partner in the eu wa amended to cover the entire eu in order to meet the requirement of the regulation this allows gns partner to actively pursue their american express business throughout the eu including country where we or other gns partner are present and may undermine the value of license granted to some gns partner to date which have been subject to varying level of exclusivity to incentivize development of the american express business in relation to particular country separation of network processing from june card network are required to separate their network processing function in which transaction between different issuer and acquirer are processed for authorization clearing and settlement this provision doe not generally apply to three party payment network such american express but may be deemed applicable for example where different gns issuer and acquirer is involved in transaction which represents very small percentage of transaction on our network co badging of card from june single card may bear the brand of multiple network and be used to process transaction on any of those network merchant may install automatic mechanism in point of sale equipment to prioritize selection of particular network subject to override by the cardholder these provision may harm the american express brand insofar gns issuing partner will be able to offer multiple network on single card and merchant may program their point of sale equipment to prioritize selection of another network on such card the wa adopted on november and wa published in the official journal of the european union on december each member state ha until january to transpose the into national law among other term the published text of includes provision that will further regulate surcharging so that transaction falling in scope of the interchange cap could not be surcharged but transaction falling outside the scope of the cap could be surcharged up to cost subject potentially to the decision of an individual member state to prohibit surcharging altogether and ii require all network including three party payment network that operate with licensing arrangement such our gns business to establish objective proportionate and non discriminatory criterion under which financial institution may access the network for example licensed issuer or acquirer the revised surcharging regulation may increase instance of differential surcharging of our card prompt customer and merchant confusion to which transaction may be surcharged and lead to card member dissatisfaction the access requirement will undermine the flexibility and discretion we have had to date in deciding with whom to partner and together with requirement in the interchange fee regulation significantly impact the value and sustainability of our gns business in europe we have brought legal challenge and seek ruling from the eu court of justice to clarify the interpretation and validity of the application of access requirement in circumstance where three party network rely on cobrand partner or through an agent table of content australia payment regulation following formal review of the regulatory framework for card payment in australia the reserve bank of australia adopted new regulation on may including the following interchange cap of july the interchange fee paid on visa and mastercard credit transaction must not exceed weighted average benchmark of percent across all transaction with maximum interchange fee cap of percent for each individual credit card transaction the inclusion of our gns business in australia under interchange regulation which subject gns payment to bank partner to the same interchange cap and regulation that apply to visa and mastercard credit card transaction in australia effective july broadening the definition of interchange fee to include any fee paid by network to card issuing bank incentive to issue card well any other net payment made to card issuer increasing the frequency of periodic weighted average benchmark calculation from every three year to quarterly to confirm compliance with the interchange cap in determining compliance all transaction at australian merchant including commercial card transaction but excluding those on foreign issued card will be taken into consideration changing the rule on merchant surcharging to limit surcharging to the actual cost of card acceptance paid to the merchant acquirer recorded on the merchant statement issued by the merchant acquirer the change took effect of september for large merchant and will take effect september for other merchant the inclusion of our gns business under interchange regulation may undermine our ability to attract and retain gns partner while the discount rate we agree to with merchant are not capped the interchange cap effective will likely exert downward pressure on merchant fee across the industry including our discount rate privacy and data protection regulatory and legislative activity in the area of privacy data protection

affected by economic market political and social condition in the united state and abroad uneven global economic growth ha had and may continue to have an adverse effect on in part because we are very dependent upon the level of consumer and business activity and the demand for payment and financing product prolonged period of slow economic growth or deterioration in economic condition could change customer behavior including spending on our card and the ability and willingness of card member to pay amount owed to travel and entertainment expenditure which comprised approximately percent of our

and investor who may have differing assumption regarding their impact on our business adversely affecting and or increasing the volatility of the trading price of our common share table of content our operating result may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payment industry the payment industry is highly competitive and we compete with charge credit and debit card network issuer and acquirer paper based transaction cash and check bank transfer model wire transfer and ach well evolving and growing alternative payment and financing provider we believe visa and mastercard are larger than we are in most country result card issuer and acquirer on the visa and mastercard network may be able to benefit from the dominant position scale resource marketing and pricing of those network some of our competitor have developed or may develop substantially greater financial and other resource than we have including larger cash reserve may offer richer value proposition or wider range of program and service than we offer or may use more effective advertising marketing or cross selling strategy to acquire and retain more customer capture greater share of spending and borrowing attain and develop more attractive cobrand card program and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have we may not be able to compete effectively against these threat or respond or adapt to change in consumer spending habit effectively our competitor we expect expense such card member reward and card member service expense to continue to increase we improve our value proposition for card member including in response to increased competition spending on our card could continue to be impacted by increasing consumer usage of charge credit and debit card issued on other network well adoption of payment system based on ach or other payment mechanism to the extent other payment mechanism system and product continue to successfully expand our discount revenue and our ability to access transaction data through our closed loop network could be negatively impacted if we are not able to differentiate from our competitor drive value for our customer and or effectively grow in area such mobile and online payment and emerging technology we may not be able to compete effectively against these threat to the extent we expand into new business area and new geographic region we may face competitor with more experience and more established relationship with relevant customer regulator and industry participant which could adversely affect our ability to compete we may face additional compliance and regulatory risk to the extent that we expand into new business area and we may need to dedicate more expense time and resource to comply with regulatory requirement than our competitor particularly those that are not regulated financial institution in addition company that control access to consumer and merchant payment method choice through digital wallet mobile application or at the point of sale could choose not to accept or could suppress use of our product or could restrict our access to our customer and transaction data such company could also require payment from to participate in such digital wallet and application impacting our profitability on transaction law and business practice that favor local competitor require card transaction to be routed over domestic network or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain business could slow our growth in international region further expanding our service offering adding customer acquisition channel and forming new partnership could have higher cost structure than our current arrangement and could adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand many of our competitor are subject to different and in some case le stringent legislative and regulatory regime more restrictive law and regulation that do not apply to all of our competitor can put at competitive disadvantage including prohibiting from engaging in certain transaction regulating our contract term and practice governing merchant card acceptance or adversely affecting our cost structure see ongoing legal proceeding regarding provision in our merchant contract could have material adverse effect on our business result in additional litigation and or arbitration subject to substantial monetary damage and damage our reputation and brand for discussion of the potential impact on our ability to compete effectively if ongoing legal proceeding limit our ability to prevent merchant from engaging in various action to discriminate against our card product we face substantial and increasingly intense competition for partner relationship which could result in loss or renegotiation of these arrangement that could have material adverse impact on our business and result of operation in the ordinary course of our business we enter into different type of contractual arrangement with business partner in variety of industry for example we have partnered with delta air line well many others globally to offer cobranded card for consumer and small business and through our membership reward program we have partnered with business in many industry including the airline industry to offer benefit to card member participant competition for relationship with key business partner is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationship establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnership is particularly competitive among card issuer and network these partnership typically have high spending loyal customer our entire cobrand portfolio accounted for approximately percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december card member loan related to our cobrand portfolio accounted for approximately percent of our worldwide card member loan of december table of content cobrand arrangement are entered into for fixed period generally ranging from five to eight year and will terminate in accordance with their term including at the end of the fixed period unless extended or renewed at the option of the party or upon early termination result of an event of default or otherwise we face the risk that we could lose partner relationship even after we have invested significant resource time and expense in acquiring and developing the relationship the volume of billed business could decline and card member attrition could increase in each case significantly result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationship in addition some of our cobrand arrangement provide that upon expiration or termination the cobrand partner may purchase or designate third party to purchase the loan generated with respect to it program which could result in significant decline in our card member loan outstanding for example our cobrand relationship with costco ended in and we sold the outstanding card member loan associated with the costco portfolio in starwood hotel resort worldwide with which we have cobrand partnership wa acquired by marriott international which ha cobrand partnership with competing card issuer we also face the risk that existing relationship will be renegotiated with le favorable term for competition for such relationship continues to increase we make payment to our cobrand partner which can be significant based primarily on the amount of card member spending and corresponding reward earned on such spending and under certain arrangement on the number of account acquired and retained the amount we pay to our cobrand partner ha increased particularly in the united state and may continue to increase arrangement are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partner among card issuer and network we may also choose to not continue certain cobrand relationship the loss of business partner whether by non renewal at the end of the contract period such the end of our relationship with costco in the united state in or early termination the result of merger or otherwise such the withdrawal of american airline in from our airport club access program for centurion and platinum card member or the renegotiation of existing partnership with term that are significantly worse for could have material adverse impact on our business and result of operation in addition any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partner could harm our reputation making it more difficult to attract and retain card member and merchant and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partner we face continued intense competitive pressure that may impact the price we charge merchant that accept our card for payment for good and service unlike our competitor in the payment industry that rely on revolving credit balance to drive profit our business model is focused on card member spending discount revenue which represents fee generally charged to merchant when card member use their card to purchase good and service on our network is primarily driven by billed business volume and is our largest single revenue source in recent year we experienced some reduction in our global weighted average merchant discount rate and have been under increasing pressure including result of regulatory mandated reduction to competitor pricing to reduce merchant discount rate and undertake other repricing initiative we also face pressure from competitor that have other source of income or lower expense base that can make their pricing more attractive to key business partner and merchant merchant are also able to negotiate incentive and pricing concession from condition to accepting our card merchant consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentive and or concession we provide to certain merchant which could materially and adversely affect our result of operation competitive and regulatory pressure on pricing could make it difficult to offset the cost of these incentive we further expect some erosion of our average merchant discount rate we seek to increase merchant acceptance we may not be successful in significantly expanding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volume at new merchant in addition differentiated payment model and technology from non traditional player in the alternative payment space and the regulatory and litigation environment could pose challenge to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our average discount rate some merchant also continue to invest in their own payment solution such proprietary branded mobile wallet using both traditional and new technology platform if merchant are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage it could adversely impact our merchant discount rate and billed business volume continuing priority of is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchant which if not successful could negatively impact our discount revenue and financial result if the average merchant discount rate decline more than expected we will need to find way to offset the financial impact by increasing billed business volume increasing other source of revenue such fee based revenue or interest income or both we may not succeed in maintaining merchant discount rate or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rate particularly in the current regulatory environment which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in value added service for merchant and card member table of content surcharging or steering by merchant could materially adversely affect our business and result of operation in certain country such australia and certain member state in the eu merchant are expressly permitted by law to surcharge card purchase the number of country in the eu that permit surcharging and the potential for selective surcharging of american express card could increase following adoption of new eu wide regulation discussed in supervision and regulation payment regulation in australia we have seen merchant surcharging on american express card in certain merchant category and in some case the surcharge is greater than that applied to visa and mastercard card practice that is known differential surcharging we also encounter merchant that accept our card but tell their customer that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of our card our card member value the ability to use their card where and when they want to and we therefore take step to meet our card member expectation and to protect the american express brand by prohibiting this form of discrimination subject to local legal requirement if surcharging steering or other form of discrimination become widespread american express card and credit and charge card generally could become le desirable to consumer which could result in decrease in card in force and transaction volume the impact could vary depending on such factor the manner in which surcharge is levied how card member are steered to other card product or payment form at the point of sale and whether and to what extent these action are applied to other payment card including whether it varies depending on the type of card network acquirer or issuer discrimination against american express card could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation particularly to the extent it disproportionately impact our card member if we are not able to invest successfully in and compete at the leading edge of technological development across all our business our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological change in order to compete in our industry we need to continue to invest across all area of our business including in transaction processing data management and analytics customer interaction and communication alternative payment mechanism and risk management and compliance system incorporating new technology into our product and service may require substantial expenditure and take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful we expect that new technology in the payment industry will continue to emerge and these new technology may be superior to or render obsolete the technology we currently use in our product and service the process of developing new product and service enhancing existing product and service and adapting to technological change and evolving industry standard is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by to anticipate customer changing need and emerging technological trend accurately could significantly impede our ability to compete effectively consumer and merchant adoption is key competitive factor and our competitor may develop product platform or technology that become more widely adopted than ours in addition we may underestimate the time and expense we must invest in new product and service before they generate material revenue if at all our ability to develop acquire or access competitive technology or business process on acceptable term may also be limited by intellectual property right that third party including competitor and potential competitor may assert in addition our ability to adopt new technology may be inhibited by need for industry wide standard changing legislative and regulatory environment the need for internal product and engineering expertise resistance to change from card member or merchant or the complexity of our system we may not be successful in our effort to promote card usage through marketing and promotion merchant acceptance and card member reward and service or to effectively control the cost of such investment both of which may impact our profitability revenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our card and growing card lending balance we have been spending at elevated level on number of growth initiative over the past several year including to attract new card member reduce card member attrition and capture greater share of customer total spending and borrowing there can be no assurance that our investment to acquire card member and increase usage of our card will be effective for example we may not be successful in developing and issuing new and enhanced card or customer may not accept our new product and service which would negatively impact our result of operation increasing spending on our card also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our card if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or revers our business could suffer another way we invest in customer value is through our membership reward program well other card member benefit any significant change in or failure by management to reasonably estimate actual redemption of membership reward point and associated redemption cost could adversely affect our profitability in addition many credit card issuer have instituted reward and cobrand program and may introduce program and service that are similar to or more attractive than ours table of content we may not be able to cost effectively manage and expand card member benefit including containing the growth of marketing promotion reward and card member service expense in the future if such expense continue to increase beyond our expectation we will need to find way to offset the financial impact by increasing payment volume increasing other area of revenue such fee based revenue or both we may not succeed in so particularly in the current regulatory environment our brand and reputation are key asset of our company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace our brand and it attribute are key asset of ours and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business card member and corporate client is highly dependent upon the external perception of our level of service trustworthiness business practice merchant acceptance financial condition and other subjective quality negative perception or publicity regarding these matter even if related to seemingly isolated incident and whether or not factually correct could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential card member and corporate client which could make it difficult for to attract new card member and customer and maintain existing one negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activity or circumstance including card practice regulatory compliance and the use and protection of customer information and from action taken by regulator or others in response to such conduct social medium channel can also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our brand our brand and reputation may also be harmed by action taken by third party that are outside our control for example any shortcoming of third party vendor merchant acquirer or gns partner may be attributed by card member and merchant to thus damaging our reputation and brand value the lack of acceptance or suppression of card usage by merchant can also negatively impact perception of our brand and our product lower overall transaction volume and increase the attractiveness of other payment product or system adverse development with respect to our industry may also by association negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against furthermore corporation with headquarters and operation located in the united state negative perception of the united state arising from it political or other position could harm the perception of our company and our brand although we monitor development for area of potential risk to our reputation and brand negative perception or publicity could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability significant operating disruption major information security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity using our card could lead to reputational damage to our brand and significant legal regulatory and financial exposure and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit card we and other third party process transmit and store account information in connection with our charge and credit card and prepaid product

embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm intent to disrupt information technology system and to expose and exploit potential security and privacy vulnerability in corporate system and website outsourcing specialization of function and technology innovation within the payment industry increase more third party are involved in processing transaction using our card and there is risk the confidentiality integrity privacy and or security of data held by third party or to which they have access including merchant that accept our card and our business partner may be compromised which could lead to unauthorized transaction on our card and cost associated with responding to such an incident table of content we develop and maintain system and process aimed at detecting and preventing information security incident and fraudulent activity which require significant investment maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating technology and regulatory requirement change and effort to overcome security measure become more sophisticated despite our effort the possibility of information security incident malicious social engineering fraudulent or other malicious activity and human error or malfeasance can not be eliminated entirely risk associated with each of these remain including the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse modification loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information including account data information or negative impact to online account and system these risk will likely evolve new technology is deployed for example with the increased use of emv technology we may see decrease in traditional fraud risk but sophisticated fraudsters may develop new way to commit fraud and we may see an increase in online fraud and impersonation and identity takeover attempt our information technology system including our transaction authorization clearing and settlement system and data center may experience service disruption or degradation because of technology malfunction sudden increase in customer transaction volume natural disaster accident power outage internet outage telecommunication failure fraud denial of service and other cyberattacks terrorism computer virus physical or electronic break in or similar event service disruption could prevent access to our online service and account information compromise company or customer data and impede transaction processing and financial reporting inadequate infrastructure in lesser developed country could also result in service disruption which could impact our ability to do business in those country if our information technology system experience significant disruption or breach or if actual or perceived fraud level or other illegal activity involving our card or customer online account were to rise due to an information security incident at business partner merchant or other market participant employee error malfeasance or otherwise it could lead to the loss of data or data integrity regulatory investigation and intervention such mandatory card reissuance increased litigation including class action litigation remediation and response cost greater concern of customer and or business partner relating to the privacy and security of their data and reputational and financial damage to our brand which could reduce the use and acceptance of our card and have material adverse impact on our business if such disruption or breach are not detected quickly their effect could be compounded information security incident and other actual or perceived failure to maintain confidentiality integrity privacy and or data protection including leaked business data may also disrupt our operation undermine our

restrict our ability to engage in certain activity or acquisition or require to maintain more capital in recent year legislator and regulator have focused on the operation of card network including interchange fee paid to card issuer in payment network such visa and mastercard and the fee merchant are charged to accept card even where we are not directly regulated regulation of bankcard fee can significantly negatively impact the discount revenue derived from our business including result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decrease in competitor pricing in connection with cap on interchange fee in some case such regulation extends to certain aspect of our business for example gns arrangement or term of card acceptance for merchant including term relating to non discrimination

including class action lawsuit many of these action have included claim for substantial compensatory or punitive damage while we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreement with customer to limit our exposure to class action litigation there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future the cfpb issued proposed rule that if enacted would among other change require that our consumer arbitration clause not apply to case filed in court class action unless and until class certification is denied or the class claim are dismissed result claim of the type we previously arbitrated could be subject to the complexity and cost associated with class action case the continued focus of merchant on issue relating to the acceptance of various form of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal action given the inherent uncertainty involved in litigation and the very large or indeterminate damage sought in some matter asserted against there is significant uncertainty to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation matter table of content we have been subject to regulatory action by the cfpb and other regulator and may continue to be subject to such action including governmental inquiry investigation and enforcement proceeding in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with law or regulation regulatory action could subject to significant fine penalty or other requirement resulting in increased expense limitation or condition on our business activity and damage to our reputation and our brand which could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition we expect that regulator will continue taking formal enforcement action against financial institution in addition to addressing supervisory concern through non public supervisory action or finding which could involve restriction on our activity among other limitation that could adversely affect our business we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rule and if we fail to meet these rule our business would be adversely affected failure to meet current or future capital or liquidity requirement including those imposed by the capital rule the lcr the nsfr or by regulator in implementing other portion of the basel iii framework and the enhanced supervision requirement of

bank subsidiary result the ultimate impact on our long term capital and liquidity planning and our result of operation is not certain although an increase in our capital and liquid asset level could lower our return on equity the capital requirement applicable to the company bank holding company and our bank subsidiary have been substantially revised to implement the international basel iii framework and are in the process of being phased in these requirement particularly once they are fully phased in require the company and our bank subsidiary to satisfy more stringent capital adequacy standard than in the past part of our required stress testing both internally and by the federal reserve we must continue to comply with applicable capital standard in the adverse and severely adverse economic scenario published by the federal reserve each year to satisfy these requirement it may be necessary for to hold additional capital in excess of that required by the capital rule they are phased in compliance with capital adequacy and liquidity rule including the capital rule and the lcr requires material investment of resource an inability to meet regulatory expectation regarding our compliance with applicable capital adequacy and liquidity rule may also negatively impact the assessment of the company and our bank subsidiary by federal banking regulator we continue to progress through the parallel run phase of basel iii advanced approach implementation depending on how the advanced approach are ultimately implemented for our asset type our capital ratio calculated under the advanced approach may be lower than under the standardized approach in such case we may need to hold significantly more regulatory capital in order to maintain given capital ratio there are several recent proposal or potential proposal that could significantly impact the regulatory capital standard and requirement applicable to financial institution such the company and our bank subsidiary well our ability to meet these requirement the basel committee ha adopted framework that would impose capital buffer on certain bank that may have an important impact on their domestic economy so called domestic systemically important bank or sib the banking regulator have not designated any sib in the united state additionally the basel committee ha proposed series of revision to the standardized approach for credit and operational risk capital requirement if these or other proposal are adopted in the united state and applied to advanced approach institution or if we are designated sib we could be required to hold significantly more capital for more information on capital adequacy requirement see capital leverage and liquidity regulation under supervision and regulation we are subject to restriction that limit our ability to pay dividend and repurchase our capital stock our subsidiary are also subject to restriction that limit their ability to pay dividend to which may adversely affect our liquidity we are limited in our ability to pay dividend and repurchase capital stock by our regulator who have broad authority to prohibit any action that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice for example we are subject to requirement to submit capital plan that include among other thing projected dividend payment and repurchase of capital stock to the federal reserve for review part of the capital planning and stress testing process our proposed capital action are assessed against our ability to satisfy applicable capital requirement in the event of stressed market environment if the federal reserve object to our capital plan or if we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirement our ability to undertake capital action may be restricted table of content in addition the capital rule include capital conservation buffer which is being phased in from january through january the capital rule also include countercyclical capital buffer which is currently set at zero but which could be increased by the federal reserve in the future these buffer can be satisfied only with capital if our risk based capital ratio were to fall below the applicable buffer level we would face graduated constraint on dividend stock repurchase and other capital distribution based on the amount of the shortfall failure to increase dividend along with our competitor or any reduction of or elimination of our common stock dividend or share repurchase program would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perception of american express our ability to declare or pay dividend on or to purchase redeem or otherwise acquire share of our common stock will be prohibited subject to certain exception in the event that we do

delinquency and rising rate of bankruptcy are often precursor of future write offs and may require to increase our reserve for loan loss we expect that some modest gradual upward pressure on our write off rate will cause provision to grow faster than loan in higher write off rate and the resulting increase in our reserve for loan loss adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our securitizations and may increase our cost of fund although we make estimate to provide for credit loss in our outstanding portfolio of loan and receivables these estimate may not be accurate in

by both higher card member loan and slight increase in delinquency and net write off rate due to the seasoning of loan related to newer card member we expect that some modest gradual upward pressure on our delinquency and write off rate due primarily to this seasoning of loan related to newer card member will cause provision to grow faster than loan in total expense for the year declined versus the prior year driven by the gain on the sale of the costco and jetblue portfolio which were recognized reduction in other expense well decline in reward expense driven by higher costco cobrand reward expense included in the prior year and the shift in volume to cash rebate card for which the reward cost are classified contra discount revenue marketing and promotion expense grew significantly due

we generally do not engage in derivative financial instrument for trading purpose other than with respect to our foreign exchange international payment business activity refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for further discussion of our derivative financial instrument of december hypothetical immediate basis point increase in market interest rate would have detrimental effect on our annual net interest income of approximately million this measure first project net interest income over the following twelve month time horizon considering forecasted business growth and anticipated future market interest rate the detrimental impact from rate increase is then measured by instantaneously increasing the anticipated future interest rate by basis point it is further assumed that our interest rate sensitive asset and liability that reprice within the twelve month horizon reprice by basis point actual change in our net interest income will depend on many factor for example the interest rate we pay on deposit balance within our high yield saving account may not change at the same time or to the same degree market interest rate in addition to parallel rate change our net interest income is subject to change in the relationship between market benchmark rate for example movement in prime rate change the yield on large portion of our variable rate lending receivables and loan while libor rate determine the effective interest rate on significant portion of our outstanding funding difference in the rate of change of these two benchmark index commonly referred to basis risk would thus impact our net interest income the detrimental effect on our net interest income of hypothetical basis point decrease in the spread between prime and one month libor over the next twelve month is estimated to be million we currently have approximately billion of prime based variable rate lending receivables and loan and billion of libor indexed debt including

amount designed to offset pretax impact from currency movement in the period in which they occur of december and foreign currency derivative instrument with total notional amount of approximately billion and billion were outstanding respectively with respect to card member spending and cross currency transaction including related foreign exchange forward contract outstanding hypothetical percent strengthening of the dollar would result in an immaterial impact to projected earnings of december with respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balance including related foreign exchange forward contract outstanding hypothetical percent strengthening of the dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity of december with respect to earnings denominated in foreign currency the adverse impact on pretax income of hypothetical percent strengthening of the dollar related to anticipated overseas operating result for the next twelve month would be approximately million of december to much lesser extent we are also subject to market risk arising from activity conducted by our foreign exchange international payment business we aim to minimize market risk from these activity through hedging where appropriate and the establishment of limit to define and protect the company from excessive exposure the actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate change will depend on among other factor the timing of rate change the extent to which different rate do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree change in the cost volume and mix of our hedging activity and change in the volume and mix of our business funding liquidity risk management process liquidity risk is defined our inability

portfolio performance and reflect our judgment regarding the quantitative component of the reserve the model take into account several factor including delinquency based loss migration rate loss emergence period and average loss over an appropriate historical period well expected future recovery we also consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserve for certain external and internal qualitative factor that may increase or decrease the reserve for loss on card member loan and receivables the process of estimating these reserve requires high degree of judgment to the extent historical credit experience updated for any external and internal qualitative factor such environmental trend is not indicative of future performance actual loss could differ significantly from our judgment and expectation resulting in either higher or lower future provision for card member loss in any quarter of december percent increase in our estimate of loss inherent in the outstanding portfolio of card member loan and receivables evaluated collectively for impairment would increase reserve for loss with corresponding change to provision for loss by approximately million this sensitivity analysis is provided hypothetical scenario to ass the sensitivity of the provision for loss it doe not represent our expectation for loss in the future nor doe it include how other portfolio factor such delinquency based loss migration rate or recovery or the amount of outstanding balance may impact the level of reserve for loss and the corresponding impact on the provision for loss liability for membership reward expense the membership reward program is our largest card based reward program card member can earn point for purchase charged on their enrolled card product significant portion of our card by their term allow card member to earn bonus point for purchase at merchant in particular industry category membership reward point are redeemable for broad variety of reward including travel entertainment retail certificate and merchandise point typically do not expire and there is no limit on the number of point card member may earn membership reward expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled card customer participation in the program and contractual arrangement with redemption partner we record membership reward liability that represents the estimated cost of point earned that are expected to be redeemed by card member in the future the membership reward liability is impacted over time by enrollment level attrition the volume of point earned and redeemed and the associated redemption cost we estimate the membership reward liability by determining the urr and the wac per point which are applied to the point of current enrollee refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information the urr assumption is used to estimate the number of point earned by current enrollee that will ultimately be redeemed in future period we use statistical and actuarial model to estimate the urr of point earned to date by current card member based on redemption trend card product type enrollment tenure card spend level and credit attribute the wac per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption cost and is primarily based on redemption choice made by card member reward offering by partner and membership reward program change the wac per point is derived from the previous month of redemption and is adjusted appropriate for certain change in redemption cost that are not representative of future cost expectation we periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumption based on development in redemption pattern cost per point redeemed partner contract change and other factor the process of estimating the membership reward liability includes high degree of judgment actual redemption and associated redemption cost could differ significantly from our estimate resulting in either higher or lower membership reward expense change in the membership reward urr and wac per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period marketing promotion reward and card member service expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all point previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollee of the end of the reporting period of december an increase in the estimated urr of current enrollee of basis point would increase the membership reward liability and corresponding reward expense by approximately million similarly an increase in the wac per point of basis point would increase the membership reward liability and corresponding reward expense by approximately million table of content fair value measurement our investment security and derivative instrument are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet which require management to make assumption and apply judgment when assessing fair value the objective of fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability by utilizing the three level hierarchy of input to valuation technique used to measure fair value when available we use quoted market price to determine fair value level if quoted market price are not available we will measure fair value based on pricing model with significant observable input level we do not have any financial instrument measured at fair value on recurring basis using significant unobservable input level for additional information on our fair value hierarchy refer to note to the consolidated financial statement investment security our investment security are mostly composed of fixed income security issued by state and municipality in the united state the government and it agency and select foreign government the fair value of our investment security including investment comprising defined benefit pension plan asset are obtained primarily from third party pricing service the fair value provided by the pricing service are estimated using pricing model where the input to those model are based on observable market input or recent trade of similar security we did not apply any adjustment to price received from the pricing service used of december and for additional information on our investment security refer to note to the consolidated financial statement derivative instrument our primary derivative instrument are interest rate swap and foreign currency forward agreement the fair value of our derivative instrument is estimated by using either third party valuation service that us proprietary pricing model or by internal pricing model where the input to those model are readily observable from actively quoted market for additional information on our derivative and hedging activity refer to note to the consolidated financial statement in the measurement of fair value for our investment security and derivative instrument although the underlying input used in the pricing model are based on observable market input the pricing model do entail certain amount of subjectivity and therefore differing judgment in the underlying input or how they are modeled could result in different estimate of fair value we reaffirm our understanding of the valuation technique used by our third party valuation service at least annually goodwill recoverability goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of asset acquired and liability assumed goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when event or circumstance arise such adverse change in the business climate that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below it carrying value our approach and methodology for conducting our goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting unit which inherently entail the use of significant judgment for valuation we use combination of the income approach discounted cash flow and market approach market multiple in estimating the fair value of our reporting unit when preparing discounted cash flow model under the income approach we estimate future cash flow using the reporting unit internal multi year forecast and terminal value calculated using growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic condition to discount these cash flow we use our expected cost of equity determined using capital asset pricing model when using the market method under the market approach we apply comparable publicly traded company multiple earnings revenue to our reporting unit actual result the judgment in estimating forecasted cash flow discount rate and market comparables is significant and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting unit refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information regarding the prepaid service goodwill impairment in we could be exposed to an increased risk of further goodwill impairment if future operating result or macroeconomic condition differ significantly from management current assumption table of content income tax we are subject to the income tax law of the united state it state and municipality and those of the foreign jurisdiction in which we operate these tax law are complex and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer fact is sometimes open to interpretation in establishing provision for income tax expense we must make judgment about the application of inherently complex tax law unrecognized tax benefit we establish liability for unrecognized tax benefit which are the difference between tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statement in establishing liability for an unrecognized tax benefit assumption may be made in determining whether and the extent to which tax position should be sustained tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on it technical merit the amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement new information becomes available we evaluate our tax position and adjust our unrecognized tax benefit appropriate tax benefit ultimately realized can differ from amount previously recognized due to uncertainty with any such difference generally impacting the provision for income tax deferred tax asset realization deferred tax asset and liability are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax base of asset and liability using the enacted tax rate expected to be in effect for the year in which the difference are expected to reverse since deferred tax measure the future tax effect of item recognized in the consolidated financial statement certain estimate and assumption are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of deferred tax asset will not be realized in making this assessment we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income reversing temporary difference and available tax planning strategy these assessment are performed quarterly taking into account any new information change in fact or circumstance can lead to change in the ultimate realization of deferred tax asset due to uncertainty table of content other matter recently issued accounting standard refer to the recently issued accounting standard section of note to the consolidated financial

market risk these instrument derive their value from an underlying variable or multiple variable including interest rate foreign exchange rate and equity index or price and are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet these instrument enable end user to increase reduce or alter exposure to various market risk and for that reason are an integral component of the company market risk management the company doe not transact in derivative for trading purpose market risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability value resulting from movement in market price the company market risk exposure include interest rate risk due to change in the relationship between interest rate on the company asset such loan receivables and investment security and interest rate on the company liability such debt and deposit and table of content foreign exchange risk related to earnings funding transaction and investment in currency other than the dollar the company centrally monitor market risk using market risk limit and escalation trigger defined in it asset liability management policy the company market exposure are in large part byproduct of the delivery of it product and service interest rate risk primarily arises through the funding of card member receivables and fixed rate loan with variable rate borrowing well through the risk to net interest margin from change in the relationship between benchmark rate such prime and libor interest rate exposure within the company charge card and fixed rate lending product is managed by varying the proportion of total funding provided by short term and variable rate debt and deposit compared to fixed rate debt and deposit in addition interest rate swap are used from time to time to economically convert fixed rate debt obligation to variable rate obligation or to convert variable rate debt obligation to fixed rate obligation the company may change the mix between variable rate and fixed rate funding based on change in business volume and mix among other factor foreign exchange risk is generated by card member cross currency charge foreign currency balance sheet exposure foreign subsidiary equity and foreign currency earnings in entity outside the united state the company foreign exchange risk is managed primarily by entering into agreement to buy and sell currency on spot basis or by hedging this market exposure to the extent it is economically justified through various mean including the use of derivative such foreign exchange forward and cross currency swap contract in addition to the exposure mentioned previously effective august the company entered into total return contract trc to hedge it exposure to change in the fair value of it equity investment in the industrial and commercial bank of china icbc in local currency under the term of the trc the company received from the trc counterparty an amount equivalent to any reduction in the fair value of it investment in icbc in local currency and the company paid to the trc counterparty an amount equivalent to any increase in the fair value of it investment in local currency along with all dividend paid by icbc well ongoing hedge cost the trc wa fully unwound on july upon the sale of the remaining underlying icbc share derivative may give rise to counterparty credit risk which is the risk that derivative counterparty will default on or otherwise be unable to perform pursuant to an uncollateralized derivative exposure the company manages this risk by considering the current exposure which is the replacement cost of contract on the measurement date well estimating the maximum potential value of the contract over the next month considering such factor the volatility of the underlying or reference index to mitigate derivative credit risk counterparties are required to be pre approved by the company and rated investment grade and counterparty risk exposure are centrally monitored additionally in order to mitigate the bilateral counterparty credit risk associated with derivative the company ha in certain instance entered into master netting agreement with it derivative counterparties which provide right of offset for certain exposure between the party majority of the company derivative asset and liability of december and are subject to such master netting agreement with it derivative counterparties and there are no instance in which management make an accounting policy election to not net asset and liability subject to an enforceable master netting agreement on the company consolidated balance sheet to further mitigate bilateral counterparty credit risk the company exercise it right under executed credit support agreement with certain of it derivative counterparties these agreement require that in the event the fair value change in the net derivative position between the two party exceeds certain dollar threshold the party in the net liability position post collateral to it counterparty all derivative contract cleared through central clearinghouse are collateralized to the full amount of the fair value of the contract in relation to the company credit risk under the term of the

the company ha billion and billion of fixed rate debt obligation designated fair value hedge of december and respectively to the extent the fair value hedge is effective the gain or loss on the hedging instrument offset the loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk any difference between the change in the fair value of the derivative and the change in the hedged item is referred to hedge ineffectiveness and is reported component of other expense hedge ineffectiveness may be caused by difference between debt obligation interest rate and the benchmark rate primarily due to credit spread at inception of the hedging relationship that are not reflected in the fair value of the interest rate swap furthermore hedge ineffectiveness may be caused by change in month libor month libor and the overnight indexed swap rate spread between these rate impact the fair value of the interest rate swap without causing an exact offsetting impact to the fair value of the
