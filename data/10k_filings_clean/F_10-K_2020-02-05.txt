website and it content is for convenience only and not deemed to be incorporated by reference into this report nor filed with the sec governmental standardsmany governmental standard and regulation relating to safety fuel economy emission control noise control vehicle recycling substance of concern vehicle damage and theft prevention are applicable to new motor vehicle engine and equipment manufactured for sale in addition manufacturing and other automotive assembly facility are subject to stringent standard regulating air emission water discharge and the handling and disposal of hazardous substance the most significant of the standard and regulation affecting are discussed below vehicle emission controlu requirement federal and california emission standard both the environmental protection agency epa and the california air resource board carb have established motor vehicle tailpipe and evaporative emission standard that become increasingly stringent over time thirteen state have adopted the california standard and other state may join them both federal and california regulation also require motor vehicle to be equipped with on board diagnostic obd system that monitor emission related system and component in addition vehicle and heavy duty engine must be certified by epa prior to sale in the united state and canada and by carb prior to sale in california and the relevant state compliance with emission standard obd requirement and related regulation can be challenging and can drive increased product development cost warranty cost and vehicle recall both epa and carb have announced that they intend to promulgate new emission regulation applicable to future heavy duty engine these rule are likely to include more stringent emission standard well new requirement affecting durability testing warranty and obd the new rule are expected to impose increased challenge and cost on the development of heavy duty engine compliance with automobile emission standard depends in part on the widespread availability of high quality and consistent automotive fuel that the vehicle were designed to use legislative regulatory and judicial development related to fuel quality at both the national and state level could affect vehicle manufacturer warranty cost well their ability to comply with vehicle emission standard the california vehicle emission program also includes requirement for manufacturer to produce and deliver for sale zero emission vehicle zevs the current zev regulation mandate substantial annual increase in the production and sale of battery electric fuel cell and plug in hybrid vehicle through the model year by the model year approximately of manufacturer total california sale volume will need to be made of such vehicle california is now in the process of promulgating future zev regulation aimed at medium and heavy duty vehicle these rule which could entail significant cost and compliance challenge are also expected to include complex warranty and recall requirement compliance with zev rule depends on market condition well the availability of adequate infrastructure to support vehicle charging business continued european requirement european union eu directive and related legislation limit the amount of regulated pollutant that may be emitted by new motor vehicle and engine sold in the eu regulatory stringency ha increased significantly since when stage vi emission standard were introduced since laboratory test cycle for and emission wa implemented in followed by the introduction of on road emission testing using portable emission analyzer real driving emission or rde these on road emission test are in addition to the laboratory based test the divergence the regulatory limit that is tested in laboratory condition and the value measured in rde test will ultimately be reduced to zero the regulatory demand increase the cost associated with complying with these requirement are significant and following the eu commission indication of it intent to accelerate emission rule in it new road map publication eu green deal the challenge will continue in addition the whole vehicle type approval wvta regulation ha been updated to increase the stringency of in market surveillance there is an increasing trend of city access restriction for internal combustion engine powered vehicle particularly in european city that do not meet air quality limit the access rule introduced are developed by individual city based on their specific concern resulting in rapid deployment of access rule that differ greatly among city the speed of implementation of access rule may directly influence customer vehicle residual value and choice of next purchase and there is risk that these rule may result in the need for customer to retrofit their vehicle with emission after treatment system in an effort to achieve country specific target supporting the paris accord some country are adopting yearly increase in tax where such system is in place and publishing date by when internal combustion powered vehicle may no longer be registered norway and the netherlands other national requirement many country in an effort to address air quality and climate change concern are adopting previous version of european or united nation economic commission for europe un ece mobile source emission regulation some country have adopted more advanced regulation based on the most recent version of european or regulation for example the china stage vi emission standard based on european stage vi emission standard for light duty vehicle evaporative and refueling emission standard and carb obd ii requirement incorporate two level of stringency for tailpipe emission level one is slated for implementation by july and the more stringent level two is slated for implementation by july the government ha encouraged the more developed city to pull ahead implementation the earliest implementation began in july canadian criterion emission regulation are largely aligned with requirement however quebec zev regulation are more stringent than those in place in california in addition in may the province of british columbia passed legislation regarding regulation of zev sale final regulation are expected in in south america there is mix of regulation and process based on and european standard brazil ha established more stringent requirement for light duty vehicle tailpipe and evaporative emission based on regulation including onboard refueling vapor recovery orvr system and obd monitor and adopted rde requirement based on european stage vi regulation new requirement to be implemented in two stage proconve by january and proconve by january include fleet average emission standard based on epa requirement for heavy duty vehicle proconve established new requirement effective january based on european stage vi regulation elsewhere there is mix of regulation and process based on and eu standard not all country have adopted appropriate fuel quality standard to accompany the stringent emission standard adopted this could lead to compliance problem particularly if obd or in use surveillance requirement are implemented global development in recent year epa and carb have increased their focus on the use of defeat device defeat device are element of design typically embedded in software that improperly cause the emission control system to function le effectively during normal on road driving than during an official laboratory emission test without justification they are prohibited by law in many jurisdiction and we do not use defeat device in our vehicle business continued regulator around the world continue to scrutinize automaker emission testing which ha led to number of defeat device settlement by various manufacturer epa is carrying additional non standard test part of it vehicle certification program carb ha also been conducting extensive non standard emission test which in some case have resulted in certification delay for diesel vehicle in the past several european country have conducted non standard emission test and published the result and in some case this supplemental testing ha triggered investigation of manufacturer for possible defeat device testing is expected to continue on an ongoing basis in addition plaintiff attorney are pursuing consumer class action lawsuit based on alleged excessive emission from car and truck which could in turn prompt further investigation by regulator vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas standardsu requirement light duty vehicle federal law requires that light duty vehicle meet minimum corporate average fuel economy cafe standard set by the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa manufacturer are subject to substantial civil penalty if they fail to meet the cafe standard in any model year after taking into account all available credit for the preceding three model year and expected credit for the five succeeding model year the law requires nhtsa to promulgate and enforce separate cafe standard applicable to each manufacturer fleet of domestic passenger car imported passenger car and light duty truck epa also regulates vehicle greenhouse gas ghg emission under the clean air act the vast majority of ghgs emitted by vehicle are the result of fuel combustion ghg emission standard are similar to fuel economy standard thus it is necessary for nhtsa and epa to coordinate with each other on their fuel economy and ghg standard respectively to avoid potential inconsistency since the model year epa and nhtsa have jointly promulgated harmonized ghg and fuel economy regulation under what came to be known the one national program onp framework california which had promulgated it own state specific set of ghg regulation agreed that compliance with the federal program would satisfy compliance with it own ghg requirement thereby avoiding patchwork of potentially conflicting federal and state ghg standard onp ha required manufacturer to achieve increasingly stringent year over year standard onp wa envisioned to continue at least through the model year the onp rule provided for midterm evaluation process under which by april epa and nhtsa would evaluate the standard for model year in order to ensure that they are feasible and optimal in light of intervening event result of the mid term evaluation process the federal government issued proposed rule to significantly reduce the stringency of future ghg standard the federal government also took the position that california vehicle ghg standard are preempted by federal law california which continues to assert it authority to regulate vehicle ghgs took step to withdraw from onp and return to enforcing it own state specific ghg standard beginning with the model year litigation over the preemption issue is underway the federal government is expected to release final rule setting fuel economy and ghg standard this rule is likely to be challenged in court by coalition of state and non governmental organization ngo the anticipated litigation over both standard and preemption with uncertain outcome creates difficulty for purpose of ford future product planning one plausible outcome is bifurcated scenario in which california along with the state that have adopted california ghg standard enforce one set of rule while different set of rule applies in the rest of the country such an outcome would impose layer of complexity on ford product planning testing certification and distribution activity in an effort to avoid such an outcome and mitigate the current regulatory uncertainty ford reached an agreement with california on set of term for an alternative framework under this framework ford will meet designated set of standard on national basis in lieu of the california regulatory program this framework enables ford to continue it product planning on nationwide basis and it is also consistent with ford environmental goal ford is in the process of finalizing formal agreement with california and the relevant state based on the framework term while the pending framework agreement help mitigate the current regulatory uncertainty it doe not resolve all potential risk or litigation outcome ford would face increased cost and complexity should bifurcated set of fuel economy ghg regulation be imposed in the future if any federal or state agency imposes and enforces fuel economy and ghg standard that are misaligned with market condition ford would likely be forced to take various action that could have substantial adverse effect on our sale volume and result of operation such action likely would include restricting offering of selected engine and popular option increasing market support program for ford most fuel efficient vehicle and ultimately curtailing the production and sale of certain vehicle such high performance car utility and or full size light truck in order to maintain compliance business continued requirement heavy duty vehicle epa and nhtsa have jointly promulgated ghg and fuel economy standard for heavy duty vehicle generally vehicle over pound gross vehicle weight rating through the model year in ford case the standard primarily affect heavy duty pickup truck and van plus vocational vehicle such shuttle bus and delivery truck the heavy duty standard increase in stringency it may become more difficult to comply while continuing to offer full lineup of heavy duty truck european requirement the eu regulates passenger car and light commercial vehicle emission using sliding scale with different target for each manufacturer based on the respective average vehicle weight for it fleet of vehicle first registered in calendar year with separate target for passenger car and light commercial vehicle penalty system applies to manufacturer failing to meet the individual target pooling agreement between manufacturer are possible under certain condition for multi stage vehicle ford transit chassis cab the base manufacturer ford is fully responsible for the performance of the final up fitted vehicle the initial target level get significantly more stringent every five year requiring significant investment in propulsion technology and extensive fleet management forcing low volume delayed launch supply shortage or lower demand for low emission vehicle well limited charging infrastructure can trigger compliance risk the eu commission is investigating the introduction of real driving and life cycle assessment element and heavy duty vehicle are addressed in separate regulation with analogous requirement and challenge discussed the eu commission ha announced green deal that is likely to trigger more stringent requirement for emission and regulated emission and include recycling and substance restriction the announcement also included pull ahead of revision date for the fleet regulation the eu commission target net climate neutrality by and more ambitious interim target instead of reduction compared to outside of the eu switzerland ha introduced similar rule ford face the risk of advance premium payment requirement for both passenger car well for light commercial vehicle due to for example unexpected market fluctuation and shorter lead time impacting average fleet performance the united nation developed technical regulation for passenger car emission and this new world light duty test procedure wltp is focused primarily on better aligning laboratory and fuel consumption figure with customer reported figure the introduction of wltp in europe started in september and requires update to labeling thereby impacting tax in country with tax scheme well fleet regulation for passenger car and light commercial vehicle cost associated with new or incremental testing for wltp are significant some european country have implemented or are considering other initiative for reducing vehicle emission including fiscal measure and labeling to address country specific target associated with the paris accord for example the united kingdom france germany spain portugal and the netherlands among others have introduced taxation based on emission the eu requirement are likely to trigger further measure other national requirement the canadian federal government regulates vehicle ghg emission under the canadian environmental protection act in october the canadian federal government published the final change to the regulation for light duty vehicle which maintain alignment with epa vehicle ghg standard for the model year canada is also undertaking mid term evaluation of the standard for the model year and beyond the outcome of which remains uncertain and may be influenced by action the final regulation for heavy duty vehicle wa published in february the model year standard will remain in place through the model year final regulation for the model year and beyond were published in may and are in line with requirement in mexico fuel economy and regulation is based on combination of nhtsa and epa standard with modification that take into consideration local condition however the current administration is seeking to implement more stringent regulation the china fuel consumption requirement us weight based approach to establish target specifies year over year target reduction and requires new energy vehicle nev mandated volume of plug in hybrid battery electric vehicle or fuel cell vehicle to generate credit equivalent to in of the year production or import fleet volume china ha set the fuel consumption fleet average at and in the government is projecting further fuel consumption reduction in and is targeting the fuel efficiency target and nev mandate will impact the cost of vehicle technology in the future business continued in south america brazil wa the first country to establish an energy efficiency policy for light duty vehicle with spark ignition engine target had to be achieved for and must be maintained through additional tax reduction are available if further fuel efficiency target are achieved and penalty may be applied if the efficiency level are not maintained in december the next phase of the fuel efficiency program wa published it includes light duty diesel and heavy duty vehicle and it will be effective in other country in the region are considering similar approach such the fuel efficiency labeling program in argentina and chile vehicle safetyu requirement the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of the safety act regulates vehicle and vehicle equipment in two primary way first the safety act prohibits the sale in the united state of any new vehicle or equipment that doe not conform to applicable vehicle safety standard established by nhtsa meeting or exceeding many safety standard is costly and ha continued to evolve global compliance and public domain new car assessment program ncaps insurance institute for highway safety iihs requirement continue to evolve are increasing in demand and lack harmonization globally we expand our business priority to include autonomous vehicle and broader mobility product and service our financial exposure ha increased second the safety act requires that defect related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaign manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicle if it determines the vehicle do not comply with safety standard should we or nhtsa determine that either safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicle the cost of such recall campaign could be substantial other national requirement the eu and many country have established vehicle safety standard and regulation and are likely to adopt additional or more stringent requirement in the future the european general safety regulation introduced un ece regulation which will be required for the european type approval process and will require the mandatory introduction of multiple active and passive safety feature with limited lead time eu regulator also are focusing on active safety feature such lane departure warning system electronic stability control and automatic brake assist globally government generally have been adopting un ece based regulation with minor variation to address local concern any difference between north american and un ece based regulation can add complexity and cost to the development of global platform vehicle and we continue to support effort to harmonize regulation to reduce vehicle design complexity while providing common level of safety performance several on going bilateral negotiation on free trade can potentially contribute to this goal new safety and recall requirement in brazil china india and gulf cooperation council country also may add substantial cost and complexity to our global recall practice brazil ha set mandatory fleet safety target and penalty are applied if these level are not maintained while tax reduction may be available for over performance in canada regulatory requirement are currently aligned with regulation however under the canadian motor vehicle safety act the minister of transport ha broad power to order manufacturer to submit notice of defect or non compliance when the minister considers it to be in the interest of safety in china new mandatory event data recorder regulation is under development that is more complex than requirement and in china malaysia and south korea mandatory call requirement are being drafted call is mandatory in the uae for new vehicle beginning with the model year new car assessment program organization around the world rate and compare motor vehicle in ncaps to provide consumer and business with additional information about the safety of new vehicle ncaps use crash test and other evaluation that are different than what is required by applicable regulation and use star to rate vehicle safety with five star awarded for the highest rating and one for the lowest achieving high ncap rating which may vary by country or region can add complexity and cost to vehicle similarly environmental rating system exist in various region green ncap in europe business continued employment datathe approximate number of individual employed by and entity that we consolidated of december wa follows in thousand and all of the hourly employee in our automotive operation are represented by union and covered by collective bargaining agreement in the united state approximately of these unionized hourly employee in our automotive segment are represented by the international union united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement worker of america uaw or united auto worker at december approximately hourly employee in the united state were represented by the uaw item risk factor we have listed below the most significant risk factor applicable to grouped into the following category operational risk macroeconomic market and strategic risk financial risk and legal and regulatory risk operational risksford long term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of global redesign and fitness action we previously announced plan for our global redesign and fitness action to transform the operational fitness of our business by becoming more customer centric and adopting process that emphasize simplicity speed and agility efficiency and accountability in addition to further improve our fitness and overall competitiveness we are attempting to leverage relationship with third party including various alliance and joint venture discussed below under ford may not realize the anticipated benefit of existing or pending strategic alliance joint venture acquisition divestiture or new business strategy if our global redesign action are not successful or are delayed for reason outside of our control particularly in europe and south america or our fitness action are not successful we may not be able to materially lower cost in the near term or improve our competitiveness in the long term which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or result of operation ford vehicle could be affected by defect that result in delay in new model launch recall campaign or increased warranty cost government safety standard require manufacturer to remedy defect related to vehicle safety through safety recall campaign and manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicle if it determines that the vehicle do not comply with safety standard nhtsa enforcement strategy ha shifted to significant increase in civil penalty levied and the use of consent order requiring direct oversight by nhtsa of certain manufacturer safety process trend that could continue should we or government safety regulator determine that safety or other defect or noncompliance exists with respect to certain of our vehicle prior to the start of production the launch of such vehicle could be delayed such defect is remedied the cost of recall and customer satisfaction action to remedy defect in vehicle that have been sold could be substantial particularly if the action relate to global platform or involve defect that are identified year after production takata airbag inflator such recall and customer satisfaction action may relate to defective component we receive from supplier and our ability to recover from the supplier may be limited by the supplier financial condition we accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverage and field service action at the time vehicle is sold and we reevaluate the adequacy of our accrual on regular basis in addition from time to time we issue extended warranty at our expense the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance for additional information regarding warranty and field service action cost including our process for establishing our reserve see critical accounting estimate in item and note of the note to the financial statement if warranty cost are greater than anticipated result of increased vehicle and component complexity the adoption of new technology or otherwise such cost could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or result of operation furthermore launch delay recall action and increased warranty cost could adversely affect our reputation or market acceptance of our product discussed below under ford new and existing product and mobility service are subject to market acceptance risk factor continued ford may not realize the anticipated benefit of existing or pending strategic alliance joint venture acquisition divestiture or new business strategy we have invested in formed strategic alliance with and announced or formed joint venture with number of company and we may expand those relationship or enter into similar relationship with additional company these initiative typically involve enormous complexity and we may not be able to complete anticipated alliance or joint venture transaction the anticipated benefit of these transaction may not be realized or the benefit may be delayed for example we may not successfully integrate an alliance or joint venture with our operation including the implementation of our control system procedure and policy or unforeseen expense or liability may arise that were not discovered during due diligence prior to an investment or entry into strategic alliance or misalignment of interest may develop between and the other party further to the extent we share ownership control or management with another party in joint venture our ability to influence the joint venture may be limited and we may be unable to prevent misconduct or implement our compliance or internal control system in addition implementation of new business strategy may lead to the disruption of our existing business operation including distracting management from current operation result of operation from new activity may be lower than our existing activity and if strategy is unsuccessful we may not recoup our investment in that strategy failure to successfully and timely realize the anticipated benefit of these transaction or strategy could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or result of operation operational system security system and vehicle could be affected by cyber incident we rely on information technology network and system including in vehicle system and mobile device some of which are managed by supplier to process transmit and store electronic information that is important to the operation of our business and our vehicle despite security measure we are at risk for interruption outage and compromise of operational system including business financial accounting product development consumer receivables data processing or manufacturing process ii facility security system and or iii in vehicle system or mobile device such cyber incident could materially disrupt operational system result in loss of trade secret or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information compromise the privacy of personal information of consumer employee or others jeopardize the security of our facility affect the performance of in vehicle system and or impact the safety of our vehicle the cyber risk exposure rise we continue to develop and produce vehicle with increased connectivity we our supplier and our dealer have been the target of cyber attack in the past and such attack will continue to evolve in the future which may cause cyber incident to be more difficult to detect for period of time our network and in vehicle system sharing similar architecture could also be impacted by the negligence or misconduct of insider or third party who have access to our network and system we continually employ capability process and other security measure designed to reduce and mitigate the risk of cyber attack however such preventative measure can not provide absolute security and may not be sufficient in all circumstance or mitigate all potential risk moreover cyber incident could harm our reputation and or subject to regulatory action or litigation and cyber incident involving or one of our supplier could impact production ford production well ford supplier production could be disrupted by labor issue natural or man made disaster financial distress production difficulty or other factor work stoppage or other limitation on production could occur at ford or it supplier facility for any number of reason including result of labor issue including dispute under existing collective bargaining agreement with labor union or in connection with negotiation of new collective bargaining agreement absenteeism public health issue or in response to potential restructuring action plant closure result of supplier financial distress or other production constraint quality issue or other difficulty result of natural disaster including climate related physical risk or for other reason many component used in our vehicle are available only from single supplier and therefore can not be re sourced quickly or inexpensively to another supplier due to long lead time new contractual commitment that may be required by another supplier ramping up to provide the component or material etc such single source supplier also could threaten to disrupt our production leverage in negotiation in addition when we undertake model changeover significant downtime at one or more of our production facility may be required and our ability to return to full production may be delayed if we experience production difficulty at one of our facility or supplier facility moreover vehicle component and their integration become more complex we may face an increased risk of delay in production of new vehicle significant disruption to our production schedule could have substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or result of operation risk factor continued ford ability to maintain competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraint substantially all of the hourly employee in our automotive operation in the united state and canada are represented by union and covered by collective bargaining agreement these agreement provide guaranteed wage and benefit level throughout the contract term and some degree of income security subject to certain condition these agreement may restrict our ability to close plant and divest business substantial number of our employee in other region are represented by union or government council and legislation or custom promoting retention of manufacturing or other employment in the state country or region may constrain practical matter our ability to sell or close manufacturing or other facility ford ability to attract and retain talented diverse and highly skilled employee is critical to it success and competitiveness our success depends on our ability to continue to recruit and retain talented and diverse employee who are highly skilled in engineering software and technology among other area competition for such employee is intense and the loss of existing employee or our inability to recruit new employee particularly with the introduction of new technology could have substantial adverse effect on our business macroeconomic market and strategic risksford new and existing product and mobility service are subject to market acceptance although we conduct extensive market research before launching new or refreshed vehicle and introducing new service many factor both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing product and service in the marketplace and we may not be able to accurately predict trend or the success of new product or service in the market it take year to design and develop new vehicle or change an existing vehicle because customer preference may change quickly our new and existing product may not generate sale in sufficient quantity and at cost low enough to be profitable offering vehicle and service that customer want and value can mitigate the risk of increasing price competition and declining demand but product and service that are perceived to be le desirable whether in term of price quality styling safety overall value fuel efficiency or other attribute can exacerbate these risk for example if we are unable to differentiate our product from those of our competitor or sufficiently tailor our product to customer in market like china there could be insufficient demand for our product which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or result of operation with increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet social medium and other medium mere allegation relating to quality safety fuel efficiency corporate social responsibility or other key attribute can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our product or service even where such allegation prove to be inaccurate or unfounded further our ability to successfully grow through investment in the area of mobility and electrification depends on many factor including advancement in technology regulatory change and other factor that are difficult to predict that may significantly affect the future of autonomous vehicle and mobility service the automotive and mobility business are very competitive and rapid change to our industry including the introduction of new type of competitor that may posse technological innovation increase the importance that we are able to anticipate develop and deliver product and service that customer desire on timely basis and at cost low enough to be profitable if the propulsion choice such electrified vehicle or autonomous vehicle and service we offer do not gain market acceptance or at the rate we expect there could be an adverse impact on our financial condition or result of operation moreover new offering may present technological challenge that could be costly to implement and overcome and may subject to customer claim if they do not operate anticipated in addition since new technology are subject to market acceptance malfunction involving any manufacturer autonomous vehicle may negatively impact the perception of autonomous vehicle and erode customer trust ford result are dependent on sale of larger more profitable vehicle particularly in the united state shift in consumer preference away from larger more profitable vehicle including truck and utility at level beyond our current planning assumption whether because of spiking fuel price decline in the construction industry government action or incentive or other reason could result in an immediate and substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or result of operation risk factor continued with global footprint ford result could be adversely affected by economic geopolitical protectionist trade policy or other event including tariff and brexit with the increasing interconnectedness of the global economy financial crisis economic downturn or recession natural disaster geopolitical crisis or other significant event in one area of the world can have an immediate and material adverse impact on market around the world change in international trade policy can also have substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or result of operation for example step taken by the government to apply or consider applying tariff on automobile part and other product and material have the potential to disrupt existing supply chain impose additional cost on our business affect the demand for our product and make le competitive further other country attempting to retaliate by imposing tariff would increase the cost for to import our vehicle into such country in addition change to and withdrawal from existing trade agreement and the entry into new trade agreement between government may impact our result of operation china in particular present unique risk to automaker due to it unique competitive and regulatory landscape for example we have established joint venture in china and discussed above under ford may not realize the anticipated benefit of existing or pending strategic alliance joint venture acquisition divestiture or new business strategy we do not have the ability to control or operate those joint venture for our sole benefit change in the chinese economy and the automotive market in particular are driving significant change to our business model for operating in china moreover change in china trade policy and new or increased tariff well further economic slowdown may have an adverse effect on our financial condition or result of operation in europe the united kingdom withdrew from the european union effective of january and is now in period of transition until the end of the transition period maintains all existing trading arrangement during the transition period the united kingdom and european union will negotiate future trading arrangement until final agreement ha been reached an exit without trade agreement in place which would result in the united kingdom losing access to free trade agreement for good and service with the european union and other country continues to be risk an exit from the european union without an agreement in place would likely result in significant reduction in industry volume in the united kingdom increased tariff on import and export and delay at the border which could have substantial adverse impact on our financial condition or result of operation to the extent there is negotiated brexit the implementation of any agreement reached and the change to current operation and process resulting therefrom could have an adverse impact on our operation we have operation in various market with volatile economic or political environment and are pursuing growth opportunity in number of newly developed and emerging market these investment may expose to heightened risk of economic geopolitical or other event including governmental takeover nationalization of our manufacturing facility or intellectual property restrictive exchange or import control disruption of operation result of systemic political or economic instability outbreak of war or expansion of hostility and act of terrorism each of which could have substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or result of operation further the government other government and international organization could impose additional sanction that could restrict from business directly or indirectly in or with certain country or party which could include affiliate industry sale volume in any of our key market can be volatile and could decline if there is financial crisis recession or significant geopolitical event because we like other manufacturer have high proportion of relatively fixed structural cost relatively small change in industry sale volume can have substantial effect on our cash flow and result of operation industry vehicle sale are affected by overall economic and market condition if industry vehicle sale were to decline to level significantly below our planning assumption for key market including the united state europe or china the decline could have substantial adverse effect on our financial condition result of operation and cash flow for discussion of economic trend see item risk factor continued ford may face increased price competition or reduction in demand for it product resulting from industry excess capacity currency fluctuation competitive action or other factor the global automotive industry is intensely competitive with manufacturing capacity far exceeding current demand industry overcapacity ha resulted in many manufacturer offering marketing incentive on vehicle in an attempt to maintain and grow market share these incentive historically have included combination of subsidized financing or leasing program price rebate and other incentive result we are not necessarily able to set our price to offset higher cost of marketing incentive commodity or other cost increase tariff or the impact of adverse currency fluctuation including pricing advantage foreign competitor may have because of their weaker home market currency continuation of or increased excess capacity particularly for truck and utility could have substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or result of operation fluctuation in commodity price foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and market value of our investment can have significant effect on result we are exposed to variety of market risk including the effect of change in commodity price foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate we monitor and manage these exposure an integral part of our overall risk management program which recognizes the unpredictability of market and seek to reduce potentially adverse effect on our business change in commodity price from tariff discussed above under with global footprint ford result could be adversely affected by economic geopolitical protectionist trade policy or other event including tariff and brexit or otherwise currency exchange rate and interest rate can not always be predicted hedged or offset with price increase to eliminate earnings volatility result significant change in commodity price foreign currency exchange rate or interest rate could have substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or result of operation see item and item for additional discussion of currency commodity price and interest rate risk in addition our result are impacted by fluctuation in the market value of our investment which are included in corporate other financial risksford and ford credit access to debt securitization or derivative market around the world at competitive rate or in sufficient amount could be affected by credit rating downgrade market volatility market disruption regulatory requirement or other factor ford and ford credit ability to obtain unsecured funding at reasonable cost is dependent on their credit rating or their perceived creditworthiness further ford credit ability to obtain securitized funding under it committed asset backed liquidity program and certain other asset backed securitization transaction is subject to sufficient amount of asset eligible for these program well ford credit ability to obtain appropriate credit rating and for certain committed program derivative to manage the interest rate risk over time and particularly in the event of credit rating downgrade market volatility market disruption or other factor ford credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchase or originates because of funding constraint the potential discontinuance of libor is one such risk that could cause market volatility or disruption in july the chief executive of the united kingdom financial conduct authority the fca which regulates libor announced that the fca intends to stop compelling bank to submit rate for the calculation of libor after it is unknown whether any bank will continue to voluntarily submit rate for the calculation of libor after or whether libor will continue to be published by it administrator based on these submission or on any other basis it is not possible to predict the effect of these change other reform or the establishment of alternative reference rate but the potential discontinuance of libor could adversely affect ford credit access to the debt securitization or derivative market and it cost of funding and hedging in addition ford credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchase or originates if there is significant decline in the demand for the type of security it offer or ford credit is unable to obtain derivative to manage the interest rate risk associated with it securitization transaction significant reduction in the amount of receivables ford credit purchase or originates would significantly reduce it ongoing result of operation and could adversely affect it ability to support the sale of ford vehicle risk factor continued ford receipt of government incentive could be subject to reduction termination or clawback we receive economic benefit from national state and local government in various region of the world in the form of incentive designed to encourage manufacturer to establish maintain or increase investment workforce or production these incentive may take various form including grant loan subsidy or tax abatement or credit the impact of these incentive can be significant in particular market during reporting period for example most of our manufacturing facility in south america are located in brazil where the state or federal government have historically offered and continue to offer significant incentive to manufacturer to encourage capital investment increase manufacturing production and create job result the performance of our south american operation ha been impacted favorably by government incentive to substantial extent in brazil however the federal government ha levied assessment concerning our calculation of federal incentive we received and certain state have challenged the grant to of tax incentive by the state of bahia decrease in expiration without renewal of or other cessation or clawback of government incentive for any of our business unit result of administrative decision or otherwise could have substantial adverse impact on our financial condition or result of operation see note of the note to the financial statement for discussion of our accounting for government incentive and item legal proceeding for discussion of tax proceeding in brazil and the potential requirement for to post collateral ford credit could experience higher than expected credit loss lower than anticipated residual value or higher than expected return volume for leased vehicle credit risk is the possibility of loss from customer or dealer failure to make payment according to contract term credit risk which is heavily dependent upon economic factor including unemployment consumer debt service burden personal income growth dealer profitability and used car price ha significant impact on ford credit business the level of credit loss ford credit may experience could exceed it expectation and adversely affect it financial condition or result of operation in addition ford credit project expected residual value including residual value support payment from ford and return volume for the vehicle it lease actual proceeds realized by ford credit upon the sale of returned leased vehicle at lease termination may be lower than the amount projected which would reduce ford credit return on the lease transaction among the factor that can affect the value of returned lease vehicle are the volume and mix of vehicle returned economic condition marketing program and quality or perceived quality safety fuel efficiency or reliability of the vehicle or change in propulsion technology and related legislative change actual return volume may be influenced by these factor well by contractual lease end value relative to auction value each of these factor alone or in combination ha the potential to adversely affect ford credit result of operation if actual result were to differ significantly from ford credit projection see critical accounting estimate in item for additional discussion economic and demographic experience for pension and other postretirement benefit plan discount rate or investment return could be worse than ford ha assumed the measurement of our obligation cost and liability associated with benefit pursuant to our pension and other postretirement benefit plan requires that we estimate the present value of projected future payment to all participant we use many assumption in calculating these estimate including assumption related to discount rate investment return on designated plan asset and demographic experience mortality and retirement rate we generally remeasure these estimate at each year end and recognize any gain or loss associated with change to our plan asset and liability in the year incurred to the extent actual result are le favorable than our assumption we may recognize substantial remeasurement loss in our result for discussion of our assumption see critical accounting estimate in item and note of the note to the financial statement pension and other postretirement liability could adversely affect ford liquidity and financial condition we have defined benefit retirement plan in the united state that cover many of our hourly and salaried employee we also provide pension benefit to non employee and retiree primarily in europe in addition we and certain of our subsidiary sponsor plan to provide other postretirement benefit opeb for retired employee primarily health care and life insurance benefit see note of the note to the financial statement for more information about these plan these benefit plan impose significant liability on and could require to make additional cash contribution which could impair our liquidity if our cash flow and capital resource were insufficient to meet any pension or opeb obligation we could be forced to reduce or delay investment and capital expenditure suspend dividend payment seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness risk factor continued legal and regulatory risksford could experience unusual or significant litigation governmental investigation or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defect in product perceived environmental impact or otherwise we spend substantial resource ensuring that we comply with governmental safety regulation mobile and stationary source emission regulation and other standard but we can not ensure that employee or other individual affiliated with will not violate such law or regulation moreover compliance with governmental standard doe not necessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuit which can entail significant cost and risk in certain circumstance court may permit tort claim even where our vehicle comply with federal and or other applicable law furthermore simply responding to actual or threatened litigation or government investigation of our compliance with regulatory standard whether related to our product or business or commercial relationship requires significant expenditure of time and other resource litigation also is inherently uncertain and we could experience significant adverse result which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or result of operation in addition adverse publicity surrounding an allegation may cause significant reputational harm that could have significant adverse effect on our sale ford may need to substantially modify it product plan to comply with safety emission fuel economy autonomous vehicle and other regulation that may change in the future the worldwide automotive industry is governed by substantial amount of government regulation which often differs by state region and country while proposal for additional regulation continue primarily out of concern for the environment including concern about global climate change and it impact vehicle safety and energy independence the regulatory landscape is in flux and can change on short notice for example discussed above under item business governmental standard the european union recently imposed stringent new regulation governing motor vehicle fleet emission beginning in with significant potential penalty for excess emission in the united state legal battle are taking shape over environmental regulatory standard california which ha an ambitious plan to reduce overall ghg emission to below level by is vigorously opposing an effort by the federal government to preempt state regulation governing motor vehicle ghg emission with the backing of other state california continues to assert it right to promulgate and enforce stringent motor vehicle ghg and zev regulation these conflict give rise to regulatory uncertainty and create the possibility that applicable regulatory standard may change quickly result of court ruling in addition many government regulate local product content and or impose import requirement with the intent of creating job protecting domestic producer and influencing the balance of payment we are continuing to make change to our product cycle plan to improve the fuel economy of our petroleum powered vehicle and to offer more propulsion choice such electrified vehicle with lower ghg emission there are limit on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvement over given time frame however primarily relating to the cost and effectiveness of available technology consumer acceptance of new technology and change in vehicle mix described in more detail above under ford new and existing product and mobility service are subject to market acceptance willingness of consumer to absorb the additional cost of new technology the appropriateness or lack thereof of certain technology for use in particular vehicle the widespread availability or lack thereof of supporting infrastructure for new technology and the human engineering and financial resource necessary to deploy new technology across wide range of product and powertrains in short time if fuel price remain relatively low and market condition do not drive consumer to purchase electric vehicle and other highly fuel efficient vehicle in large number it may be difficult to meet applicable environmental standard without compromising result increased scrutiny of automaker emission testing by regulator around the world ha led to new regulation more stringent enforcement program request for field action and or delay in regulatory approval the cost to comply with existing government regulation is substantial and additional regulation or change in consumer preference that affect vehicle mix could have substantial adverse impact on our financial condition or result of operation in addition number of government well ngo publicly ass vehicle to their own protocol the protocol could change and any negative perception regarding the performance of our vehicle subjected to such test could reduce future sale court decision arising out of consumer and investor litigation could give rise to de facto change in the interpretation of existing emission law and regulation thereby imposing new burden on manufacturer for more discussion of the impact of standard on our global business see the governmental standard discussion in item business above risk factor continued we and other company continue to develop autonomous vehicle technology and the and foreign government are continuing to develop the regulatory framework that will

asset item legal proceeding the litigation process is subject to many uncertainty and the outcome of individual matter is not predictable with assurance see note of the note to the financial statement for discussion of loss contingency following is discussion of our significant pending legal proceeding product liability matterswe are defendant in numerous action in state and federal court within and outside of the united state alleging damage from injury resulting from or aggravated by alleged defect in our vehicle in many action no monetary amount of damage is specified or the specific amount alleged is the jurisdictional minimum our experience with litigation alleging specific amount of damage suggests that such amount on average bear little relation to the actual amount of damage if any that we will pay in resolving such matter in addition to pending action we ass the likelihood of incident that likely have occurred but not yet been reported to we also take into consideration specific matter that have been raised claim but have not yet proceeded to litigation individual product liability matter which if resolved unfavorably to the company likely would involve significant cost would be described herein currently there are no such matter to report asbestos matter asbestos wa used in some brake clutch and other automotive component from the early along with other vehicle manufacturer we have been the target of asbestos litigation and result are defendant in various action for injury claimed to have resulted from alleged exposure to ford part and other product containing asbestos plaintiff in these personal injury case allege various health problem result of asbestos exposure either from component part found in older vehicle insulation or other asbestos product in our facility or asbestos aboard our former maritime fleet we believe that we are targeted more aggressively in asbestos suit because many previously targeted company have filed for bankruptcy or emerged from bankruptcy relieved of liability for such claim most of the asbestos litigation we face involves individual who claim to have worked on the brake of our vehicle we are prepared to defend these case and believe that the scientific evidence confirms our long standing position that there is no increased risk of asbestos related disease result of exposure to the type of asbestos formerly used in the brake on our vehicle the extent of our financial exposure to asbestos litigation remains very difficult to estimate and could include both compensatory and punitive damage award the majority of our asbestos case do not specify dollar amount for damage in many of the other case the dollar amount specified is the jurisdictional minimum and the vast majority of these case involve multiple defendant sometimes more than one hundred many of these case also involve multiple plaintiff and often we are unable to tell from the pleading which plaintiff are making claim against opposed to other defendant annual payout and defense cost may become significant in the future our accrual for asbestos matter includes probable loss for both asserted and unasserted claim legal proceeding continued consumer matterswe provide warranty on the vehicle we sell warranty are offered for specific period of time and or mileage and vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of it sale pursuant to these warranty we will repair replace or adjust all part on vehicle that are defective in factory supplied material or workmanship during the specified warranty period we are defendant in numerous action in state and federal court alleging damage based on state and federal consumer protection law and breach of warranty obligation remedy under these statute may include vehicle repurchase civil penalty and plaintiff attorney fee in some case plaintiff also include an allegation of fraud remedy for fraud claim may include contract rescission vehicle repurchase and punitive damage the cost of these matter is included in our warranty cost we accrue obligation for warranty cost at the time of sale using patterned estimation model that includes historical information regarding the nature frequency and average cost of claim for each vehicle line by model year we reevaluate the adequacy of our accrual on regular basis we are currently defendant in significant number of litigation matter relating to the performance of vehicle including those equipped with transmission environmental matter we have received notice under various federal and state environmental law that we along with others are or may be potentially responsible party for the cost associated with remediating numerous hazardous substance storage recycling or disposal site in many state and in some instance for natural resource damage we also may have been generator of hazardous substance at number of other site the amount of any such cost or damage for which we may be held responsible could be significant we have one environmental legal proceeding to which governmental authority is party and in which we believe there is the possibility of monetary sanction in excess of notice of violation to ford chicago assembly plant on august epa issued notice of violation to our chicago assembly plant epa alleges that the plant violated several requirement related to it air permit monetary sanction if any have not yet been determined class action in light of the fact that very few of the purported class action filed against in the past have ever been certified by the court class action in general we list those action that have been certified class action by court of competent jurisdiction and any additional purported class action that raise allegation substantially similar to an existing and certified class and ii likely would involve significant cost if resolved unfavorably to the company at this time other than described below we

discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation revenueour automotive segment revenue is generated primarily by sale of vehicle part and accessory revenue is recorded when control is transferred to our customer generally our dealer and distributor for the majority of sale this occurs when product are shipped from our manufacturing facility this is not the case however with respect to vehicle produced for sale to daily rental car company with an obligation to repurchase the vehicle for guaranteed amount exercisable at the option of the customer these contract are accounted for operating lease with lease revenue and profit recognized over the term of the lease proceeds from the sale of vehicle at auction are recognized in revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the buyer most of the vehicle sold by to our dealer and distributor are financed at wholesale by ford credit upon ford credit originating the wholesale receivable related to dealer purchase of vehicle ford credit pay cash to the relevant automotive legal entity in payment of the dealer obligation for the purchase price of the vehicle the dealer then pay the wholesale finance receivable to ford credit when it sell the vehicle to retail customer our ford credit segment revenue is generated primarily from interest on finance receivables net of certain deferred origination cost that are included reduction of financing revenue and such revenue is recognized over the term of the receivable using the interest method also revenue from operating lease is recognized on straight line basis over the term of the lease income is generated to the extent revenue exceed expense most of which are interest depreciation and operating expense transaction between our automotive and ford credit segment occur in the ordinary course of business for example we offer special retail financing and lease incentive to dealer customer who choose to finance or lease our vehicle from ford credit the cost for these incentive is included in our estimate of variable consideration at the date the related vehicle sale to our dealer are recorded in order to compensate ford credit for the lower interest or lease payment offered to the retail customer we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to ford credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract with the dealer customer ford credit recognizes the incentive amount over the life of retail finance contract an element of financing revenue and over the life of lease contract reduction to depreciation see note of the note to the financial statement for more detailed discussion of transaction between our automotive and ford credit segment cost and expensesour income statement classifies our automotive segment total cost and expense into two category cost of sale and ii selling administrative and other expense we include within cost of sale those cost related to the development manufacture and distribution of our vehicle part and accessory specifically we include in cost of sale each of the following material cost including commodity cost freight cost warranty including product recall cost labor and other cost related to the development and manufacture of our product depreciation and amortization and other associated cost we include within selling administrative and other expense labor and other cost not directly related to the development and manufacture of our product including such expense advertising and sale promotion cost certain of our cost such material cost generally vary directly with change in volume and mix of production in our industry production volume often varies significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year quarterly production volume experience seasonal shift throughout the year including peak retail sale season and the impact on production of model changeover and new product launch annual production volume are heavily impacted by external economic factor including the pace of economic growth and factor such the availability of consumer credit and cost of fuel management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued result we analyze the profit impact of certain cost change holding constant present year volume and mix and currency exchange in order to evaluate our cost trend absent the impact of varying production and currency exchange level we analyze these cost change in the following category contribution cost these cost typically vary with production volume these cost include material including commodity warranty and freight and duty cost structural cost these cost typically do not have directly proportionate relationship to production volume these cost include manufacturing engineering spending related advertising and sale promotion administrative and selling and pension and opeb cost while contribution cost generally vary directly in proportion to production volume element within our structural cost category are impacted to differing degree by change in production volume we also have varying degree of discretion when it come to controlling the different element within our structural cost for example depreciation and amortization expense largely is associated with prior capital spending decision on the other hand while labor cost do not vary directly with production volume manufacturing labor cost may be impacted by change in volume for example when we increase overtime add production shift or add personnel to support volume increase other structural cost such advertising or engineering cost do not necessarily have directly proportionate relationship to production volume our structural cost generally are within our discretion although to varying degree and can be adjusted over time in response to external factor we consider certain structural cost to be direct investment in future growth and revenue for example structural cost are necessary to grow our business and improve profitability invest in new product and technology respond to increasing industry sale volume and grow our market share cost of sale and selling administrative and other expense for full year were billion our automotive segment material and commodity cost make up the largest portion of these cost and expense representing in about two third of the total amount structural cost are the largest piece of the remaining balance although material cost are our largest absolute cost our margin can be affected significantly by change in any category of cost key economic factor and trend affecting the automotive industrycurrency exchange rate volatility the federal reserve lowered it policy interest rate three time in after nine increase over the course of the tightening cycle beginning in late central bank in other developed market have also signaled the potential for rate cut in response to recent global economic headwind extending the era of monetary policy easing that began with the global financial crisis the related shift in capital flow have contributed to increased volatility for both developed and emerging market currency globally emerging market also face differing inflation backdrop and in some case exposure to commodity price and political instability contributing to unpredictable movement in the value of their exchange rate in addition to direct impact on the financial flow of global automotive company currency movement can also impact pricing of vehicle exported to overseas market most notably in the case of the japanese yen and korean in most market exchange rate are market determined and all are impacted by many different macroeconomic and policy factor and thus likely to remain volatile however in some market exchange rate are heavily influenced or controlled by government excess capacity according to ihs automotive an automotive research firm the estimated automotive industry global production capacity for light vehicle of about million unit exceeded global production by about million unit in while global production capacity rose by about million unit in compared with excess capacity rose by nearly million unit including increase in north america europe and most substantially in china in north america and europe two region where significant share of industry revenue is earned excess capacity percent of production in increased to and respectively in china the auto industry witnessed excess capacity at in industry sale remained below expectation due to weaker economic condition there according to production capacity data projected by ihs automotive global excess capacity condition could continue for several year at an average of about million unit per year declining only gradually from current level during the period from to management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued pricing pressure excess capacity coupled with proliferation of new product being introduced in key segment will keep pressure on manufacturer ability to set price in north america the industry restructuring of the past few year ha allowed manufacturer to better match production with demand although japanese and korean manufacturer also have capacity located outside of the region directed to north america in the future chinese and indian manufacturer are expected to enter and european market further intensifying competition over the long term intense competition and excess capacity will continue to put downward pressure on inflation adjusted price for similarly contented vehicle in the united state and contribute to challenging pricing environment for the automotive industry in europe the excess capacity situation ha been exacerbated by the nominal reduction in existing capacity such that negative pricing pressure is expected to continue for the foreseeable future commodity and energy price change change in market expectation for global demand notably weaker growth in china along with geopolitical tension have generated volatility in energy price though they remain at relatively low level compared with historical performance oil price are expected to remain volatile and on lower long term trend than in prior commodity cycle price for other commodity have also been volatile fluctuating global demand and the threat of further tariff action continues to impact price despite some easing in global trade tension at the start of this year vehicle profitability our financial result depend on the profitability of the vehicle we sell which may vary significantly by vehicle line in general larger vehicle tend to command higher price and be more profitable than smaller vehicle both across and within vehicle segment for example in north america our larger more profitable vehicle had an average contribution margin that wa about of our total average contribution margin across all vehicle whereas our smaller vehicle had significantly lower contribution margin in addition government regulation aimed at reducing emission and increasing fuel efficiency zev mandate and low emission zone may increase the cost of vehicle by more than the perceived benefit to the consumer given the backdrop of excess capacity these regulation could dampen contribution margin trade policy to the extent government in various region erect or intensify barrier to import or implement currency policy that advantage local exporter selling into the global marketplace there can be significant negative impact on manufacturer based in other market while we believe the long term trend will support the growth of free trade we have noted with concern recent development in number of region the imposition of tariff on steel and aluminum coming into the united state in had direct negative impact on cost for manufacturer in the market in asia pacific weak yen significantly reduces the cost of export into the united state europe and other global market by japanese manufacturer and over period of time contribute to other country pursuing weak currency policy by intervening in the exchange rate market this is particularly likely in other asian country such south korea we will continue to monitor and address developing issue around trade policy other economic factor interest rate notably mature market government bond yield and inflation have remained lower than expected at the time government deficit and debt remain at high level in many major market the eventual implication of higher government deficit and debt with potentially higher long term interest rate may drive higher cost of capital over our planning period higher interest rate and or tax to address the higher deficit also may impede real growth in gross domestic product and therefore vehicle sale over our planning period management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued result of operation income attributable

measure change to residual performance at prior period exchange rate for analysis purpose management split residual performance primarily into residual gain and loss and the change in accumulated supplemental depreciation residual gain and loss change are primarily driven by the number of vehicle returned to ford credit and sold and the difference between the auction value and the depreciated

be critical if the accounting estimate requires to make assumption about matter that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate wa made and change in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimate that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have material impact on our financial condition or result of operation management ha discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of director in addition there are other item within our financial statement that require estimation but are not deemed critical defined above change in estimate used in these and other item could have material impact on our financial statement warranty and field service actionsnature of estimate required we provide base warranty on the product we sell for specific period of time and or mileage which vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of it sale separately we also periodically perform field service action related to safety recall emission recall and other product campaign pursuant to these warranty and field service action we will repair replace or adjust all part on vehicle that are defective in factory supplied material or workmanship we accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverage and field service action at the time of sale in addition from time to time we issue extended warranty at our expense the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance assumption and approach used we establish our estimate of base warranty obligation using patterned estimation model we use historical information regarding the nature frequency and average cost of claim for each vehicle line by model year we reevaluate our estimate of base warranty obligation on regular basis experience ha shown that initial data for any given model year may be volatile therefore our process relies on long term historical average until sufficient data are available actual experience becomes available we use the data to update the historical average we then compare the resulting accrual with present spending rate to ass whether the balance are adequate to meet expected future obligation based on this data we update our estimate necessary field service action are distinguishable from warranty in that they may occur in period beyond the base warranty coverage period we establish our estimate of field service action obligation using patterned estimation model we use historical information regarding the nature frequency severity and average cost of claim for each model year we ass our obligation for field service action on regular basis using actual claim experience and update our estimate necessary due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factor used in establishing our estimate change in our assumption could materially affect our financial condition and result of operation see note of the note to the financial statement for information regarding warranty and product recall related cost pension and other postretirement employee benefit nature of estimate required the estimation of our defined benefit pension and opeb plan obligation and expense requires that we make use of estimate of the present value of the projected future payment to all participant taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future event such demographic experience and health care cost increase plan obligation and expense are based on existing retirement plan provision no assumption is made regarding any potential future change to benefit provision beyond those to which we are presently committed in existing labor contract management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued assumption and approach used the assumption used in developing the required estimate include the following key factor discount rate our discount rate assumption is based primarily on the result of cash flow matching analysis which match the future cash outflow for each major plan to yield curve based on high quality bond specific to the country of the plan benefit payment are discounted at the rate on the curve to determine the year end obligation expected long term rate of return on plan asset our expected long term rate of return considers input from range of advisor for capital market return inflation bond yield and other variable adjusted for specific aspect of our investment strategy by plan historical return also are considered where appropriate the assumption is based on consideration of all input with focus on long term trend to avoid short term market influence salary growth our salary growth assumption reflects our actual experience long term outlook and assumed inflation inflation our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicator including real gross domestic product growth and central bank inflation target expected contribution our expected amount and timing of contribution are based on an assessment of minimum requirement cash availability and other consideration funded status avoidance of regulatory premium and levy and tax efficiency retirement rate retirement rate are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience mortality rate mortality rate are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience health care cost trend our health care cost trend assumption are developed based on historical cost data the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trend assumption are set at each year end and are generally not changed during the year unless there is major plan event such curtailment or settlement that would trigger plan remeasurement see note of the note to the financial statement for more information regarding pension and opeb cost and assumption pension planseffect of actual result the year end weighted average discount rate wa for plan and for non plan reflecting decrease of and basis point respectively compared with year end in the actual return on asset wa which wa higher than the expected long term rate of return of non actual return on asset wa which wa higher than the expected long term rate of return of in total these difference in addition to demographic and other update resulted in net remeasurement loss of billion which ha been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported special item for the expected long term rate of return on asset is for plan down basis point from and for non plan down basis point compared with year ago primarily reflecting an increased allocation to fixed income asset and lower consensus on capital market return expectation from advisor de risking strategy we employ broad global de risking strategy which increase the matching characteristic of our asset relative to our obligation funded status improves change in interest rate which directly influence change in discount rate in addition to other factor have significant impact on the value of our pension obligation and fixed income asset portfolio our de risking strategy ha increased the allocation to fixed income investment and reduced our funded status sensitivity to change in interest rate change in interest rate should result in offsetting effect in the value of our pension obligation and the value of the fixed income asset portfolio management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued sensitivity analysis the december pension funded status and expense are affected by year end assumption sensitivity to these assumption may be asymmetric and are specific to the time period noted the effect of change in the factor which generally have the largest impact on year end funded

change increase decrease ye obligation increase decrease expense factor discount rate obligation bps ainterest rate service cost and interest cost income taxesnature of estimate required we must make estimate and apply judgment in determining the provision for income tax for financial reporting purpose we make these estimate and judgment primarily in the following area the calculation of tax credit ii the calculation of difference in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purpose that will ultimately be reported in tax return well iii the calculation of interest and penalty related to uncertain tax position change in these estimate and judgment may result in material increase or decrease to our tax provision which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued assumption and approach used we are subject to the income tax law and regulation of the many jurisdiction in which we operate these tax law and regulation are complex and involve uncertainty in the application to our fact and circumstance that may be open to interpretation we recognize benefit for these uncertain tax position based upon process that requires judgment regarding the technical application of the law regulation and various related judicial opinion if in our judgment it is more likely than not that the uncertain tax position will be settled favorably to we estimate an amount that ultimately will be realized this process is inherently subjective since it requires our assessment of the probability of future outcome we evaluate these uncertain tax position on quarterly basis including consideration of change in fact and circumstance such new regulation or recent judicial opinion well the status of audit activity by taxing authority change to our estimate of the amount to be realized are recorded in our provision for income tax during the period in which the change occurred we must also ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset against future source of taxable income and reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax asset by recording valuation allowance if based on all available evidence it is more likely than not defined likelihood of more than that all or portion of such asset will not be realized this assessment which is completed on taxing jurisdiction basis take into account number of type of evidence including the following nature frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting loss pattern of objectively measured recent financial reporting loss is heavily weighted source of negative evidence we generally consider cumulative pre tax loss in the three year period ending with the current quarter to be significant negative evidence regarding future profitability we also consider the strength and trend of earnings well other relevant factor in certain circumstance historical information may not be relevant due to change in our business operation source of future taxable income future reversal of existing temporary difference are heavily weighted source of objectively verifiable positive evidence projection of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary difference are source of positive evidence only when the projection are combined with history of recent profit and can be reasonably estimated otherwise these projection are considered inherently subjective and generally will not be sufficient to overcome negative evidence that includes relevant cumulative loss in recent year particularly if the projected future taxable income is dependent on an anticipated turnaround to profitability that ha not yet been achieved in such case we generally give these projection of future taxable income no weight for the purpose of our valuation allowance assessment and tax planning strategy if necessary and available tax planning strategy would be implemented to accelerate taxable amount to utilize expiring carryforwards these strategy would be source of additional positive evidence and depending on their nature could be heavily weighted we presently believe that valuation allowance of million is required primarily related to deferred tax asset in various non operation we believe that we ultimately will recover the remaining billion of deferred tax asset we have assessed recoverability of these asset and concluded that no valuation allowance is required for these asset for additional information regarding income tax see note of the note to the financial statement impairment of long lived assetsnature of estimate required held and used long lived asset we test our long lived asset group when change in circumstance indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable event that trigger test for recoverability include material adverse change in projected revenue and expense present cash flow loss combined with history of present cash flow loss and forecast that demonstrates significant continuing loss significant negative industry or economic trend current expectation that long lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of it useful life significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is used or in it physical condition or when there is change in the asset grouping when triggering event occurs test for recoverability is performed comparing projected undiscounted future cash flow to the carrying value of the asset group if the test for recoverability identifies possible impairment the asset group fair value is measured relying primarily on discounted cash flow method to the extent available we will also consider third party valuation of our long lived asset that were prepared for other business purpose an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds it estimated fair value when an impairment loss is recognized for asset to be held and used the adjusted carrying amount of those asset is depreciated over their remaining useful life management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued nature of estimate required held for sale operation we perform an impairment test on disposal group to be discontinued held for sale or otherwise disposed of when we have committed to an action and the action is expected to be completed within one year we estimate fair value to approximate the expected proceeds to be received le cost to sell and compare it to the carrying value of the disposal group an impairment charge is recognized when the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value assumption and approach used held and used long lived asset we measure the fair value of an asset group based on market price the amount for which the asset could be sold to third party when available when market price are not available we generally estimate the fair value of the asset group using the income approach and or the market approach the income approach us cash flow projection inherent in our development of cash flow projection are assumption and estimate derived from review of our operating result business plan forecast expected growth rate and cost of capital similar to those market participant would use to ass fair value we also make certain assumption about future economic condition and other data many of the factor used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and these assumption and estimate may change in future period change in assumption or estimate can materially affect the fair value measurement of an asset group and therefore can affect the test result the following are key assumption we use in making cash flow projection business projection we make assumption about the demand for our product in the marketplace theseassumptions drive our planning assumption for volume mix and pricing we also make assumption about our cost level capacity utilization cost performance these projection are derived using our internal business plan forecast that are updated at least annually and reviewed by our board of director long term growth rate growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business and is added to the present value of the debt free interim cash flow the growth rate is the expected rate at which business unit earnings stream is projected to grow beyond the planning period discount rate when measuring possible impairment future cash flow are discounted at rate that is consistent with weighted average cost of capital that we anticipate potential market participant would use weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall risk adjusted pre tax rate of return expected by equity and debt holder of business enterprise economic projection assumption regarding general economic condition are included in and affect our assumption regarding industry sale and pricing estimate for our vehicle these macroeconomic assumption include but are not limited to industry sale volume inflation interest rate price of raw material commodity and foreign currency exchange rate during we embarked on comprehensive strategy aimed at strengthening the competitive position and profitability of our operation part of this process we have initiated several key fitness action aimed at reducing structural cost while at the same time consulting with our key stakeholder and partner with regard to fundamental redesign of our operation this redesign includes change to the company vehicle portfolio expanding offering and volume in it most profitable growth vehicle segment while improving or exiting le profitable vehicle line and addressing underperforming market against this backdrop we determined that there were triggering event related to asia pacific operation china and south america business unit and tested our long lived asset for impairment we also tested the newly formed international market group img business unit which combined our asia pacific operation and middle east africa business unit and also includes the result of our joint venture in russia using our internal economic and business projection well third party valuation of certain long lived asset we determined that the carrying value of the long lived asset in these business unit wa recoverable at december if in future quarter our economic or business projection were to change result of our plan or change in the business environment there wa significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which long lived asset is being used or there is current expectation that long lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of it useful life we would undertake additional testing appropriate which could result in an impairment of long lived asset assumption and approach used held for sale operation in the third quarter of we committed to plan to sell specific net asset in our india automotive operation we entered into definitive agreement to form joint venture with mahindra mahindra limited mahindra with mahindra owning percent controlling stake and ford owning percent stake under the term of the transaction which is expected to close mid ford will sell certain india automotive operation to the joint venture management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued our commitment to sell the india automotive operation triggered held for sale impairment test the fair value of the disposal group is measured using market approach and estimated based on expected proceeds to be received le cost to sell which we conclude is most representative of the value of the net asset given the current market condition the characteristic of viable market participant and the pending sale transaction result of the impairment testing we recognized pre tax impairment charge of million reported in cost of sale allowance for credit lossesthe allowance for credit loss represents ford credit estimate of the probable credit loss inherent in finance receivables of the balance sheet date the adequacy of ford credit allowance for credit loss is assessed quarterly and the assumption and model used in establishing the allowance are evaluated regularly because credit loss can vary substantially over time estimating credit loss requires number of assumption about matter that are uncertain see note of the note to the financial statement for more information regarding allowance for credit loss nature of estimate required ford credit estimate the probable credit loss inherent in finance receivables based on several factor consumer portfolio ford credit estimate the allowance for credit loss on consumer receivables using combination of measurement model and management judgment the model consider factor such historical trend in credit loss and recovery including key metric such delinquency repossession and bankruptcy the composition of ford credit present portfolio including vehicle brand term risk evaluation and new used vehicle trend in historical used vehicle value and economic condition estimate from these model rely on historical information and may not fully reflect loss inherent in the present portfolio therefore ford credit may adjust the estimate to reflect management judgment regarding observable change in recent economic trend and condition portfolio composition and other relevant factor assumption used ford credit allowance for credit loss is based on it assumption regarding frequency the number of finance receivables that are expected to default over the loss emergence period lep measured repossession repossession ratio reflects the number of finance receivables that ford credit expects will default over period of time divided by the average number of contract outstanding and loss severity the expected difference between the amount customer owes when the finance contract is charged off and the amount received net of expense from selling the repossessed vehicle collective allowance for credit loss the collective allowance is evaluated primarily using collective loss to receivables ltr model that based on historical experience indicates credit loss have been incurred in the portfolio even though the particular account that are uncollectible can not be specifically identified the ltr model is based on the most recent year of history an ltr for each product is calculated by dividing credit loss charge offs net of recovery by average net finance receivables excluding unearned interest supplement and allowance for credit loss the average ltr that is calculated for each product is multiplied by the end of period balance for that given product ford credit largest market also use loss projection model to estimate loss inherent in the portfolio the loss projection model applies recent monthly performance metric stratified by contract type retail installment sale contract or finance lease contract term month and risk rating to ford credit active portfolio to estimate the loss that have been incurred the lep is an assumption within ford credit model and represents the average amount of time between when loss event first occurs to when it is charged off this time period start when the consumer begin to experience financial difficulty it is evidenced typically through delinquency before eventually resulting in charge off the lep is multiplier in the calculation of the collective consumer allowance for credit loss for account greater than day past due the uncollectible portion is charged off such that the remaining recorded investment is equal to the estimated fair value of the collateral le cost to sell specific allowance for impaired receivables consumer receivables involved in troubled debt restructurings are specifically assessed for impairment specific allowance is estimated based on the present value of the expected future cash flow of the receivable discounted at the contract original effective interest rate or the fair value of any collateral adjusted for estimated cost to sell management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued after establishing the collective and specific allowance for credit loss if ford credit management belief the allowance doe not reflect all loss inherent in the portfolio due to change in recent economic trend and condition or other relevant factor an adjustment is made based on management judgment sensitivity analysis change in the assumption used to derive frequency and severity would affect the allowance for credit loss the effect of the indicated increase decrease in the assumption for ford credit ford and lincoln retail financing is follows in million assumption basis point change increase decrease frequency repossession ratio bps loss severity per unit non consumer portfolio ford credit estimate the allowance for credit loss for non consumer receivables based on historical ltr ratio expected future cash flow and the fair value of collateral collective allowance for credit loss ford credit estimate an allowance for non consumer receivables that are not specifically identified impaired using an ltr model for each financing product based on historical experience this ltr is an average of the most recent historical experience and is calculated consistent with the consumer receivables ltr approach all account that are specifically identified impaired are excluded from the calculation of the non specific or collective allowance specific allowance for impaired receivables dealer financing is evaluated by segmenting individual loan by the risk characteristic of the loan such the amount of the loan the nature of the collateral and the financial status of the debtor the loan are analyzed to determine whether individual loan are impaired and specific allowance is estimated based on the present value of the expected future cash flow of the receivable discounted at the loan original effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral adjusted for estimated cost to sell after establishing the collective and specific allowance for credit loss if ford credit management belief the allowance doe not reflect all loss inherent in the portfolio due to change in recent economic trend and condition or other relevant factor an adjustment is made based on management judgment change in ford credit assumption affect ford credit interest operating and other expense on our income statement and the allowance for credit loss contained within ford credit finance receivables net on our balance sheet accumulated depreciation on vehicle subject to operating leasesaccumulated depreciation on vehicle subject to operating lease reduces the value of the leased vehicle in ford credit operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their expected residual value at the end of the lease term ford credit monitor residual value each month and it review the adequacy of accumulated depreciation on quarterly basis if ford credit belief that the expected residual value for it vehicle have changed it revise depreciation to ensure that net investment in operating lease equal to the acquisition value of the vehicle le accumulated depreciation will be adjusted to reflect ford credit revised estimate of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term such adjustment to depreciation expense would result in change in the depreciation rate of the vehicle subject to operating lease and are recorded prospectively on straight line basis each lease customer ha the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end

ford credit purchase lease it establishes an expected residual value for the vehicle ford credit estimate the expected residual value by evaluating recent auction value return volume for it leased vehicle industrywide used vehicle price marketing incentive plan and vehicle quality data management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued assumption used ford credit accumulated depreciation on vehicle subject to operating lease is based on assumption regarding auction value ford credit projection of the market value of the vehicle when sold at the end of the lease and return volume ford credit projection of the number of vehicle that will be returned at lease end see note of the note to the financial statement for more information regarding accumulated depreciation on vehicle subject to operating lease sensitivity analysis for returned vehicle ford credit face risk that the amount it obtains from the vehicle sold at auction will be le than it estimate of the expected residual value for the vehicle the impact of the change in assumption on future auction value and return volume would increase or decrease accumulated supplemental depreciation and depreciation expense over the remaining term of the operating lease the effect of the indicated increase decrease in the assumption for ford credit ford and lincoln operating lease portfolio is follows in million assumption basis pointchange increase decrease future auction value bps volume adjustment to the amount of accumulated supplemental depreciation on operating lease

for long term debt with variable rate interest we estimate the future interest payment based on projected market interest rate for various floating rate benchmark received from third party in addition

obligation operating lease obligation and long term debt see note and respectively of the note to the financial statement quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskoverviewwe are exposed to variety of market and other risk including the effect of change in foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate well risk to availability of funding source hazard event and specific asset risk these risk affect our automotive and ford credit segment differently we monitor and manage these exposure an integral part of our overall risk management program which includes regular report to central management committee the global risk management committee grmc the grmc is chaired by our chief financial officer and the committee includes our controller and chief financial officer automotive our treasurer and other member of senior management our automotive and ford credit segment are exposed to liquidity risk including the possibility of having to curtail business or being unable to meet financial obligation they come due because funding source may be reduced or become unavailable our plan is to maintain funding source to ensure liquidity through variety of economic or business cycle discussed in greater detail in item our funding source include sale of receivables in securitizations and other structured financing unsecured debt issuance equity and equity linked issuance and bank borrowing we are exposed to variety of insurable risk such loss or damage to property liability claim and employee injury we protect against these risk through the purchase of commercial insurance that is designed to protect above our self insured retention against event that could generate significant loss direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategy resides with our treasurer office and is governed by written policy and procedure separation of duty is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trade the transaction of derivative and the settlement of cash flow regular audit are conducted to ensure that appropriate control are in place and that they remain effective in addition our market risk exposure and our use of derivative to manage these exposure are approved by the grmc and reviewed by the audit committee of our board of director in accordance with our corporate risk management policy we use derivative instrument when available such forward contract swap and option that economically hedge certain exposure foreign currency commodity and interest rate we do not use derivative contract for trading market making or speculative purpose in certain instance we forgo hedge accounting and in certain other instance our derivative do not qualify for hedge accounting either situation result in unrealized gain and loss that are recognized in income for additional information on our derivative see note of the note to the financial statement the market and counterparty risk of our automotive and ford credit segment are discussed and quantified below automotive market riskour automotive segment frequently ha expenditure and receipt denominated in foreign currency including the following purchase and sale of finished vehicle and production part debt and other payable subsidiary dividend and investment in foreign operation these expenditure and receipt create exposure to change in exchange rate we also are exposed to change in price of commodity used in the production of our vehicle and change in interest rate foreign currency risk commodity risk and interest rate risk are measured and quantified using model to evaluate the sensitivity of market value to instantaneous parallel shift in rate and or price foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial result could be worse than planned because of change in currency exchange rate accordingly our practice is to use derivative instrument to hedge our economic exposure with respect to forecasted revenue and cost asset liability and firm commitment denominated in certain foreign currency consistent with our overall risk management strategy in our hedging action we use derivative instrument commonly used by corporation to reduce foreign exchange risk forward contract quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk continued the net fair value of foreign exchange forward contract including adjustment for credit risk of december wa liability of million compared with an asset of million of december the potential decrease in fair value from adverse change in the underlying exchange rate in dollar term would have been billion at december compared with billion at december the sensitivity analysis presented is hypothetical and assumes foreign exchange rate change are instantaneous and adverse across all currency in reality some of our exposure offset and foreign exchange rate move in different magnitude and at different time and any change in fair value would generally be offset by change in the underlying exposure see note of the note to the financial statement for more information regarding our foreign currency exchange contract commodity price risk commodity price risk is the possibility that our financial result could be worse than planned because of change in the price of commodity used in the production of motor vehicle such base metal steel copper and aluminum precious metal palladium energy natural gas and electricity and plastic resin polypropylene accordingly our practice is to use derivative instrument to hedge the price risk with respect to forecasted purchase of certain commodity that we can economically hedge primarily base metal and precious metal and consistent with our overall risk management strategy in our hedging action we use derivative instrument commonly used by corporation to reduce commodity price risk financially settled forward contract the extent to which we hedge is also impacted by our ability to achieve designated hedge accounting the net fair value of commodity forward contract including adjustment for credit risk of december wa liability of million compared with liability of million of december the potential decrease in fair value from adverse change in the underlying commodity price would be million at december compared with million at december in addition our purchasing organization with guidance from the grmc appropriate negotiates contract to ensure continuous supply of raw material in some case these contract stipulate minimum purchase amount and specific price and therefore play role in managing commodity price risk interest rate risk interest rate risk relates to the loss we could incur in our company cash investment portfolio due to change in interest rate our interest rate sensitivity analysis on the investment portfolio includes cash and cash equivalent and net marketable security at december we had billion in our company cash investment portfolio compared to billion at december we invest the portfolio in security of various type and maturity the value of which are subject to fluctuation in interest rate the investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guideline to maintain liquidity minimize risk and earn reasonable return on the short term investment in investing our company cash safety of principal is the primary objective and risk adjusted return is the secondary objective at any time rise in interest rate could have material adverse impact on the fair value of our portfolio assuming hypothetical increase in interest rate of one percentage point the value of our portfolio would be reduced by million calculated of december this compare to million calculated of december while these are our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario actual result could differ from those projected the sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate change are instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve in reality interest rate change of this magnitude are rarely instantaneous or parallel quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk continued ford credit market risk market risk for ford credit is the possibility that change in interest and currency exchange rate will adversely affect cash flow and economic value interest rate risk generally ford credit asset and the related debt have different re pricing period and consequently respond differently to change in interest rate ford credit asset consist primarily of fixed rate retail financing and operating lease contract and floating rate wholesale receivables fixed rate retail financing and operating lease contract generally require customer to make equal monthly payment over the life of the contract wholesale receivables are originated to finance new and used vehicle held in dealer inventory and generally require dealer to pay floating rate debt consists primarily of short and long term unsecured and securitized debt ford credit term debt instrument are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payment over the life of the instrument and single principal payment at maturity ford credit interest rate risk management objective is to reduce volatility in it cash flow and volatility in it economic value from change in interest rate based on an established risk tolerance that may vary by market ford credit us economic value sensitivity analysis and re pricing gap analysis to evaluate potential long term effect of change in interest rate it then enters into interest rate swap to convert portion of it floating rate debt to fixed or it fixed rate debt to floating to ensure that ford credit exposure fall within the established tolerance ford credit also us pre tax cash flow sensitivity analysis to monitor the level of near term cash flow exposure the pre tax cash flow sensitivity analysis measure the change in expected cash flow associated with ford credit interest rate sensitive asset liability and derivative financial instrument from hypothetical change in interest rate over twelve month horizon ford credit asset liability committee review the re pricing mismatch and exposure every month and approves interest rate swap required to maintain exposure within approved threshold prior to execution to provide quantitative measure of the sensitivity of it pre tax cash flow to change in interest rate ford credit us interest rate scenario that assume hypothetical instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in all interest rate across all maturity parallel shift well base case that assumes that all interest rate remain constant at existing level in reality interest rate change are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rate could move more or le than the one percentage point assumed in ford credit analysis result the actual impact to pre tax cash flow could be higher or lower than the result detailed in the table below these interest rate scenario are purely hypothetical and do not represent ford credit view of future interest rate movement under these interest rate scenario ford credit expects more debt and liability than asset to re price in the next twelve month other thing being equal this mean that during period of rising interest rate the interest received on ford credit asset will increase le than the interest paid on ford credit debt thereby initially decreasing ford credit pre tax cash flow during period of falling interest rate ford credit would expect it pre tax cash flow to initially increase ford credit pre tax cash flow sensitivity to interest rate movement is highlighted in the table below pre tax cash flow sensitivity at december wa follows in million pre tax cash flow sensitivity percentage point instantaneous increase in interest rate one percentage point instantaneous decrease in interest rate pre tax cash flow sensitivity given one percentage point decrease in interest rate requires an assumption of negative interest rate in market where existing interest rate are below one percent while the sensitivity analysis presented is ford credit best estimate of the impact of the specified assumed interest rate scenario it actual result could differ from those projected the model ford credit us to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumption embedded in the model are assumption regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal refinancing of maturing debt replacement of maturing derivative exercise of option embedded in debt and derivative and predicted repayment of retail financing and operating lease contract ahead of contractual maturity ford credit repayment projection ahead of contractual maturity are based on historical experience if interest rate or other factor change ford credit actual prepayment experience could be different than projected quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk continued foreign currency risk ford credit policy is to minimize exposure to change in currency exchange rate to meet funding objective ford credit borrows in variety of currency principally dollar canadian dollar euro sterling and renminbi ford credit face exposure to currency exchange rate if mismatch exists between the currency of receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables when possible receivables are funded with debt in the same currency minimizing exposure to exchange rate movement when different currency is used ford credit may use foreign currency swap and foreign currency forward to convert substantially all of it foreign currency debt obligation to the local country currency of the receivables result of this policy ford credit belief it market risk exposure relating to change in currency exchange rate at december is insignificant derivative fair value the net fair value of ford credit derivative financial instrument wa an asset of million and million at december and respectively counterparty risk counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or derivative contract we enter into master agreement with counterparties that allow netting of certain exposure in order to manage this risk exposure primarily relate to investment in fixed income instrument and derivative contract used for managing interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risk we together with ford credit establish exposure limit for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive allowing to take risk mitigation action before risk become loss exposure limit are established based on our overall risk tolerance which is calculated from counterparty credit rating and market based credit default swap cd spread the exposure limit are lower for smaller and lower rated counterparties counterparties that have relatively higher cd spread and for longer dated exposure our exposure are monitored on regular basis and included in periodic report to our treasurer substantially all of our counterparty exposure are with counterparties that have an investment grade rating investment grade is our guideline for minimum counterparty long term rating item financial statement and

quarterly basis we review our available for sale security for impairment if we conclude that any of these investment are impaired we determine whether such impairment is other than temporary factor we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell if any impairment is considered other than temporary we will write down the asset to it fair value and record the corresponding charge in other income loss net trade receivablestrade and other receivables consists primarily of automotive segment receivables from contract with customer for the sale of vehicle part and accessory trade receivables initially are recorded at the transaction amount and are typically outstanding for le than day each reporting period we evaluate the collectibility of the receivables and record an allowance for doubtful account representing our estimate of the probable loss addition to the allowance for doubtful account are made by recording charge to bad debt expense reported in selling administrative and other expense net intangible asset and goodwillindefinite lived intangible asset and goodwill are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if event or circumstance indicate the asset may be impaired goodwill impairment testing is also performed following an allocation of goodwill to business to be disposed or change in reporting unit we test for impairment by assessing qualitative factor to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset or the reporting unit allocated the goodwill is le than it carrying amount if the qualitative assessment indicates possible impairment the carrying value of the asset or reporting unit is compared with it fair value fair value is measured relying primarily on the income approach by applying discounted cash flow method the market approach using market value or multiple and or third party valuation we capitalize and amortize our finite lived intangible asset over their estimated useful life intangible asset are comprised primarily of licensing and advertising agreement land right patent customer contract and technology the net carrying amount of our intangible asset wa million and million at december and respectively the net

current expectation that long lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of it useful life significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is used or in it physical condition or when there is change in the asset grouping when triggering event occurs test for recoverability is performed comparing projected undiscounted future cash flow to the carrying value of the asset group if the test for recoverability identifies possible impairment the asset group fair value is measured relying primarily on discounted cash flow method to the extent available we will also consider third party valuation of our long lived asset that were prepared for other business purpose an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds it estimated fair value when an impairment loss is recognized for asset to be held and used the adjusted carrying amount of those asset is depreciated over their remaining useful

recognized when the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value see note fair value measurementswe measure fair value of our financial instrument including those held within our pension plan using various valuation method and prioritize the use of observable input the use of observable and unobservable input and their significance in measuring fair value are reflected in our fair value hierarchy level input include quoted price for identical instrument and are the most observable level input include quoted price for similar instrument and observable input such interest rate currency exchange rate and yield curve level input include data not observable in the market and reflect management judgment about the assumption market participant would use in pricing the instrumentsfixed

hierarchy level are recognized if they had taken place at the end of the reporting period valuation methodfixed income security fixed income security primarily include government security government agency security corporate bond and asset backed security we generally measure the fair value using price obtained from pricing service or quote from dealer that make market in such security pricing method and input to valuation model used by the pricing service depend on the security type asset class where possible fair value are generated using market input including quoted price the closing price in an exchange market bid price the price at which buyer stand ready to purchase and other market information for fixed income security that are not actively traded the pricing service use alternative method to determine fair value for the security including quote for similar fixed income security matrix pricing discounted cash flow using benchmark curve or other factor in certain case when market data are not available we may use broker quote or pricing service that use proprietary pricing model to determine fair value the proprietary model incorporate unobservable input primarily consisting of prepayment curve discount rate default assumption recovery rate yield assumption and credit spread assumption an annual review is performed on the security price received from our pricing service which includes discussion and analysis of the input used by the pricing service to value our security the price of certain security sold close to the quarter end are also compared to the price of the same security at the balance sheet date to ensure the reported fair value is reasonable equity equity security are primarily exchange traded and are valued based on the closing bid official close or last trade pricing on an active exchange if closing price are not available security are valued at the last quoted bid price or may be valued using the last available price security

and any posted collateral we use our counterparty cd spread when we are in net asset position and our own cd spread when we are in net liability position in case where market data is not available we use broker quote and model black scholes to determine fair value this includes situation where there is lack of liquidity for particular currency or commodity or when the instrument is longer dated

discounted to present value based on assumption regarding credit loss pre payment speed and applicable spread to approximate current rate our assumption regarding pre payment speed and credit loss are based on historical performance the fair value of finance receivables is categorized within level of the hierarchy on nonrecurring basis we also measure at fair value retail contract greater than day past due or deemed to be uncollectible and individual dealer loan probable of foreclosure we use the fair value of collateral adjusted for estimated cost to sell to determine the fair value of our receivables the collateral for retail financing or wholesale receivable is the vehicle financed and for dealer loan is real estate or other property the fair value of collateral for retail receivables is calculated the outstanding receivable balance multiplied by the average recovery value percentage the fair value of collateral for wholesale receivables is based on the wholesale market value or liquidation value for new and used vehicle the fair value of collateral for dealer loan is determined by reviewing various appraisal which include total adjusted appraised value of land and improvement alternate use appraised value broker opinion of value and purchase offer debt we measure debt at fair value using quoted price for our own debt with approximately the same remaining maturity see note where quoted price are not available we estimate fair value using discounted cash flow and market based expectation for interest rate credit risk and the contractual term of the debt instrument for certain short term debt with an original maturity date of one year or le we assume that book value is reasonable approximation of the debt fair value the fair value of debt is

for credit loss the allowance for credit loss represents an estimate of the probable credit loss inherent in finance receivables of the balance sheet date the adequacy of the allowance for credit loss is assessed quarterly and the assumption and model used in establishing the allowance are evaluated regularly because credit loss may vary substantially over time estimating credit loss requires number of assumption about matter that are uncertain the majority of credit loss are attributable to ford credit consumer receivables addition to the allowance for credit loss are made by recording charge to ford credit interest operating and other expense on our consolidated income statement the uncollectible portion of finance receivables are charged to the allowance for credit loss at the earlier of when an account is deemed to be uncollectible or when an account is day delinquent taking into consideration the financial condition of the customer or borrower the value of the collateral

the composition of the present portfolio including vehicle brand term risk evaluation and new used vehicle trend in historical used vehicle value and economic condition estimate from these model rely on historical information and may not fully reflect loss inherent in the present portfolio therefore ford credit may adjust the estimate to reflect management judgment regarding observable change in

owes when the finance contract is charged off and the amount received net of expense from selling the repossessed vehicle collective allowance for credit loss the collective allowance is evaluated primarily using collective loss to receivables ltr model that based on historical experience indicates credit loss have been incurred in the portfolio even though the particular account that are uncollectible can not be specifically identified the ltr model is based on the most recent year of history an ltr for each product is calculated by dividing credit loss charge offs net of recovery by average net finance receivables excluding unearned interest supplement and allowance for credit loss the average ltr that is calculated for each product is multiplied by the end of period balance for that given product the largest market also use loss projection model to estimate loss inherent in the portfolio the loss projection model applies recent monthly performance metric stratified by contract type retail installment sale contract or finance lease contract term month and risk rating to the active portfolio to estimate the loss that have been incurred the lep is an assumption within the model and represents the average amount of time between when loss event first occurs to when it is charged off this time period start when the consumer begin to experience financial difficulty it is evidenced typically through delinquency before eventually resulting in charge off the lep is multiplier in the calculation of the collective consumer allowance for credit loss for account greater

performance under these indemnity generally would be triggered by breach of term of the contract or by third party claim while some of these indemnification are limited in nature many of them do not

exposure to these matter is difficult to estimate many matter do not specify dollar amount for damage and many others specify only jurisdictional minimum to the extent an amount is asserted our historical experience suggests that in most instance the amount asserted is not reliable indicator of the ultimate outcome motor company and subsidiariesnotes to the financial statementsnote commitment and contingency continued we accrue for matter when loss are deemed probable and reasonably estimable in evaluating matter for accrual and disclosure purpose we take into consideration factor such our historical experience with matter of similar nature the specific fact and circumstance asserted the likelihood that we will prevail and the severity of any potential loss we reevaluate and update our accrual matter progress over time for the majority of matter which generally arise out of alleged defect in our product we establish an accrual based on our extensive historical experience with similar matter we do not believe there is reasonably possible outcome materially in excess of our accrual for these matter for the remaining matter where our historical experience with similar matter is of more limited value non pattern matter we evaluate the matter primarily based on the individual fact and circumstance for non pattern matter we evaluate whether there is reasonable possibility of material loss in excess of any accrual that can be estimated our estimate of reasonably possible loss in excess of our accrual for all material matter currently reflects indirect tax and custom matter for which we estimate the aggregate risk to be range of up to about million in addition we have reasonably possible risk of loss for an emission matter at this stage we can not estimate the risk of loss or predict the outcome and can not provide reasonable assurance that it will not have material adverse effect on noted the litigation process is subject to many uncertainty and the outcome of individual matter is not predictable with assurance our assessment are based on our knowledge and experience but the ultimate outcome of any matter could require payment substantially in excess of the amount that we have accrued and or disclosed warranty and field service actionswe accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverage and field service action at the time of sale we establish our estimate of base warranty obligation using patterned estimation model using historical information regarding the nature frequency and average cost of claim for each

average cost of claim for each model year in addition from time to time we issue extended warranty at our expense the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance warranty and field service action obligation are reported in other liability and deferred revenue we reevaluate the adequacy of our accrual on regular basis we recognize the benefit from recovery of the cost associated
