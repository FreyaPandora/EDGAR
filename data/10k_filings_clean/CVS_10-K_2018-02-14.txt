factor our business is subject to various industry economic regulatory and other risk and uncertainty our business financial condition result of operation cash flow and prospect could be materially adversely affected by any one or more of the following risk factor and by additional risk and uncertainty not presently known to or that we currently deem to be immaterial risk of declining gross margin in the pbm retail pharmacy and ltc pharmacy industry the pbm industry ha been experiencing margin pressure result of competitive pressure and increased client demand for lower price increased revenue sharing enhanced service offering and or higher service level in that regard we maintain contractual relationship with generic pharmaceutical manufacturer and brand name pharmaceutical manufacturer that provide for purchase discount and or rebate on drug dispensed by pharmacy in our retail network and by our specialty and mail order pharmacy all or portion of which may be passed on to client manufacturer rebate often depend on pbm ability to meet contractual market share or other requirement including in some case the placement of manufacturer product on the pbm formulary if we lose our relationship with one table of content or more pharmaceutical manufacturer or if the discount or rebate provided by pharmaceutical manufacturer decline our business and financial result could be adversely affected further competitive pressure in the pbm industry have resulted in our client sharing in larger portion of rebate and or discount received from pharmaceutical manufacturer market dynamic and regulatory change have impacted our ability to offer plan sponsor pricing that includes the use of retail differential or spread which could negatively impact our future profitability further change in existing federal or state law or regulation or the adoption of new law or regulation relating to patent term extension purchase discount and rebate arrangement with pharmaceutical manufacturer or to formulary management or other pbm service could also reduce the discount or rebate we receive in addition change in federal or state law or regulation or the adoption of new law or regulation relating to claim processing and billing including our ability to use mac list and collect transmission fee could adversely impact our profitability our retail pharmacy specialty pharmacy and ltc pharmacy operation have also been affected by the margin pressure described above including client demand for lower price generic pricing and network reimbursement pressure in addition competition increase in the market in which we operate significant increase in general pricing pressure could occur and this could require to reevaluate our pricing structure to remain competitive shift in the mix of our pharmacy prescription volume towards program offering lower reimbursement rate could adversely affect our margin including the shift in pharmacy mix towards day prescription at retail and the shift in pharmacy mix towards medicare part prescription finally the margin of our ltc business are further affected by the increased effort of health care payors to negotiate reduced or capitated pricing arrangement these action could also adversely affect the margin of our ltc business effort to reduce reimbursement level and alter health care financing practice the continued effort of health maintenance organization managed care organization pbms government entity and other third party payors to reduce prescription drug cost and pharmacy reimbursement rate well litigation and other legal proceeding relating to how drug are priced may impact our profitability in particular increased utilization of generic pharmaceutical which normally yield higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand named drug ha resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payment to retail specialty ltc and mail order pharmacy for generic drug causing reduction in the generic profit rate historically the effect of this trend on generic profitability ha been mitigated by our effort to negotiate reduced acquisition cost of generic pharmaceutical with manufacturer however in recent year there ha been significant consolidation within the generic manufacturing industry and it is possible that this and other external factor may enhance the ability of manufacturer to sustain or increase pricing of generic pharmaceutical and diminish our ability to negotiate reduced acquisition cost any inability to offset increased cost or to modify our activity to lessen the impact could have significant adverse effect on our result of operation in addition during the past several year the united state health care industry ha been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and audit at both the federal and state level effort to control health care cost including prescription drug cost are continuing at the federal and state government level changing political economic and regulatory influence may significantly affect health care financing and reimbursement practice for example we anticipate that federal and state government will continue to review and ass alternative health care delivery system payment methodology and operational requirement for health care provider including ltc facility and pharmacy change in the composition of pharmacy prescription volume toward program offering lower reimbursement rate could negatively impact our profitability any action taken to repeal or replace all or significant part of aca could also impact our profitability though it is unclear at this time what the full effect will be aca made several significant change to medicaid rebate and to reimbursement one of these change wa to revise the definition of the average manufacturer price pricing element common to most payment formula and the reimbursement formula for multi source generic drug this change ha negatively affected our reimbursement in addition aca made other change that affect the coverage and plan design that are or will be provided by many of our health plan client including the requirement for health insurer to meet minimum medical loss ratio to avoid having to pay rebate to enrollee these aca change may not affect our business directly but they could indirectly impact our service and or business practice highly competitive business environment each of our retail pharmacy ltc pharmacy retail health clinic and pharmacy service operation currently operates in highly competitive and evolving health care environment table of content the competitive success of our retail pharmacy business well our specialty pharmacy operation with non caremark payors is derived by their ability to establish and maintain contractual relationship with pbms and other payors on acceptable term in an environment where some pbm client are considering adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy network pharmacy retail business we compete with other drugstore chain supermarket on line and other discount retailer independent pharmacy membership club convenience store and mass merchant some of which are aggressively expanding into market we serve we also face competition from other retail health clinic well other mail order pharmacy and pbms disruptive innovation by existing or new competitor could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require to accurately identify and ass such change and make timely and effective change to our strategy and business model to compete effectively competition may also come from other source in the future change in market dynamic or the action of competitor or manufacturer including industry consolidation the emergence of new competitor and strategic alliance and the exclusion from new narrow or restricted network could materially and adversely impact we could also be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to change in market dynamic for example specialty pharmacy represents significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the united state significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacy because our specialty pharmacy operation focus on complex and high cost medication that serve relatively limited universe of patient the future growth of this business depends to significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drug and successfully penetrate key treatment category the competitive success of our ltc pharmacy operation is dependent upon our ability to compete in each geographic region where we have operation in the geographic region we serve we compete with pharmerica our largest competitor well with numerous local and regional institutional pharmacy pharmacy owned by long term care facility and local retail pharmacy our long term care customer consist of skilled nursing facility assisted living facility independent living community hospital correctional facility and other health care service provider we believe that the assisted living segment where resident can choose which pharmacy will provide them with pharmaceutical is projected to grow the most percentage of the total ltc sector over the near term the ability of resident of an assisted living facility to select the pharmacy that supply or with pharmaceutical could adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation because there can be no assurance that such resident will select the competitive success of our pharmacy service business is impacted by it ability to establish and maintain contractual relationship with network pharmacy in an environment where some pbm client are considering adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy network competitor in the pbm industry express script optumrx prime therapeutic medimpact and humana include large national pbm company pbms owned by large national health plan and smaller standalone pbms competition may also come from other source in the future in addition change in the overall composition of our pharmacy network or reduced pharmacy access under our network could adversely affect our claim volume and or our competitiveness generally competitor in each of our business area may offer service and pricing term that we may not be willing or able to offer strong competition in the pbm marketplace ha generated greater client demand for lower pricing increased revenue sharing and enhanced product and service offering unless we can demonstrate enhanced value to our client through innovative product and service offering particularly in rapidly changing health care industry we may be unable to remain competitive change in policy law and regulation including reform of the united state health care

significantly impact our business and the health care and retail industry while it is not possible to predict whether and when any such change will occur or what form any such change may take including through the use of executive order specific proposal discussed by the presidential administration could have material adverse effect on our business liquidity and result of operation include

other government regulation affecting trade between the united state and other country are also possible table of content potential modification to aca significant change to medicaid funding or even significant destabilization of the health insurance marketplace could impact the number of american with health insurance and consequently prescription drug coverage further change to aca are possible and we can not predict the effect if any on future change to aca the implementation or failure to implement the outstanding provision of aca or the enactment of new health care system legislation to replace current legislation may have on our retail pharmacy ltc pharmacy specialty pharmacy and pharmacy service operation in addition much of the branded and generic drug product that we sell in our retail mail and specialty pharmacy and much of the other merchandise we sell is manufactured in whole or in substantial part outside of the united state in most case the product or merchandise are imported by others and sold to result significant change in tax or trade policy tariff or trade relation between the united state and other country such the imposition of unilateral tariff on imported product could result in significant increase in our cost restrict our access to supplier depress economic activity and have material impact on our business liquidity and result of operation in addition other country may change their business and trade policy and such change well any negative sentiment towards the united state in response to increased import tariff and other change in trade regulation could adversely affect our business risk related to compliance with broad and complex regulatory framework our business is subject to numerous federal state and local law and regulation see

however pbm client may negotiate shorter or longer contract term or may require early or periodic renegotiation of pricing prior to expiration of contract our client are generally well informed and organized can move between our competitor and often seek competing bid prior to expiration of their contract in addition the reputational impact of service related incident could negatively affect our business these factor together with the impact of competitive pressure could make it difficult for to attract new client retain existing client and cross sell additional service further the pbm industry ha been affected by consolidation activity that may continue in the future in the event one or more of our pbm client is acquired by an entity that is not also our client we may be unable to retain all or portion of the acquired business these circumstance either individually or in the aggregate could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial result therefore we

decline result of such regulatory ruling or market change further we acquire substantial amount of our mail and specialty pharmacy prescription drug supply from limited number of supplier our agreement with these supplier are often short term and easily cancelable by either party without cause in addition these agreement may limit our ability to provide service for competing drug during

margin rate due to regulatory and competitive pressure further result of aca and change to the retiree drug subsidy rule our pbm client could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefit to their medicare eligible member to the extent this occurs the adverse effect of increasing customer migration into medicare part may outweigh the benefit we realize from growth of our medicare part business in addition if the cost and complexity of medicare part exceed management expectation or prevent effective program implementation or administration if change to the regulation regarding how drug cost are reported for medicare part are implemented in manner that impact the profitability of our medicare part business if change to the regulation impact our ability to retain fee from third

successfully implement corrective action or other remedial measure sufficient to prevent or remove any applicable restriction that may be imposed by cm or if we are not successful in retaining enrollee or winning contract renewal or new contract under medicare part competitive bidding process our medicare part service and the ability to expand our medicare part service could be negatively impacted possible change in industry pricing benchmark and drug pricing generally it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulator may evaluate and or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price awp or wholesale acquisition cost wac which are the pricing reference used for many of our pbm and ltc client contract pharmaceutical purchase agreement retail network contract specialty payor agreement and other contract with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payment in addition many state medicaid fee for service program ffs medicaid have established pharmacy network payment on the basis of actual acquisition cost aac the use of an aac basis in ffs medicaid could have an impact in reimbursement practice in other commercial and government segment future change to the use of awp wac or to other published pricing benchmark used to establish pharmaceutical pricing including change in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health program and or other payors could impact the reimbursement we receive from medicare and medicaid program the reimbursement we receive from pbm client and other payors and or our ability to negotiate rebate and or discount with pharmaceutical manufacturer wholesaler pbms and retail pharmacy failure or inability to fully offset any increased price or cost or to modify our operation to mitigate the impact of such increase could have an adverse effect on our result of operation table of content additionally any future change in drug price could be significantly different than our projection the effect of these possible change on our business can not be predicted at this time product liability product recall or personal injury issue could damage our reputation failure to maintain adequate liability insurance coverage the product that we sell could become subject to contamination product tampering mislabeling recall or other damage in addition error in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceutical could lead to serious injury or death product liability or personal injury claim may be asserted against with respect to any of the product or pharmaceutical we sell or service we provide our business involves the provision of professional service including by pharmacist nurse and nurse practitioner that expose to

relationship with broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our financial performance and erode customer loyalty finally our specialty pharmacy business focus on complex and high cost medication many of which are made available by manufacturer to limited number of pharmacy so called limited distribution drug that serve relatively limited universe of patient result the future growth of our specialty pharmacy business is dependent largely upon expanding our base of drug or penetration in certain treatment category any contraction of our base of patient or reduction in demand for the prescription we currently dispense could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation risk related to developing and maintaining relevant omni channel experience for our customer our business ha evolved from retail store experience to interaction with customer across numerous channel including in store online mobile and social medium among others omni channel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectation and new development by our competitor our customer are increasingly using computer tablet mobile phone and other device to comparison shop determine product availability and complete purchase through mobile commerce application result the portion of total consumer expenditure with all retailer

electronic fund transfer these requirement may change in the future which could make compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment option including credit and debit card we pay interchange and other fee which could increase periodically thereby raising our operating cost we rely on third party to provide payment processing service including the processing of credit card debit card and various other form of electronic payment if these company are unable to provide these service to or if their system are compromised our operation could be disrupted the payment method that we offer also expose to potential fraud and theft by person seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weakness in the payment system if we fail to abide by applicable rule or requirement or if data relating to our payment system is compromised due to breach or misuse we may be responsible for any cost incurred by payment card issuing bank and other third party or subject to fine and higher

both state and federal government sponsored payer result of budget deficit or reduction may suspend payment or seek to reduce their healthcare expenditure resulting in our customer delaying payment to or renegotiating their contract with any delay or reduction in payment by such government sponsored payer may adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation our outstanding debt and associated payment obligation could significantly increase in the future if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt our current debt service cost associated with our increased debt level may negatively impact our ability to make important investment in our business and limit our flexibility to respond to industry change and market condition in addition our debt level and related debt service obligation could make it more difficult or expensive for to obtain financing for working capital capital expenditure acquisition or other purpose in the future these

indebtedness and assume approximately billion of existing indebtedness of aetna if we do not retire our existing debt or debt we assume in acquisition or other strategic transaction the risk described above could increase we also could be adversely impacted by any failure to renew or replace on term acceptable to or at all existing indebtedness when it expires and by any failure to satisfy applicable covenant we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or otherwise access the capital market for any reason whether due to market condition or otherwise our continued access to the capital market and the term of such access depend on multiple factor including the condition of debt capital market our operating performance the amount of our table of content indebtedness and debt

seasonality of our business although the majority of our revenue particularly pharmacy revenue are generally not seasonal in nature front store revenue tend to be higher during the december holiday season uncharacteristic or extreme weather condition can adversely impact consumer shopping pattern well this could lead to lost sale well increased snow removal and other cost thereby negatively affecting our short term result of operation in addition both pharmacy and front store revenue are affected by the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season which is susceptible to large

december we had billion of goodwill and other intangible asset goodwill and indefinitely lived intangible asset are subject to annual impairment review or more frequent review if event or circumstance indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when evaluating goodwill for potential impairment we first compare the fair value of our reporting unit to their respective carrying amount we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit using combination of discounted cash flow model and comparable market multiple model if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is le than it carrying amount an impairment loss calculation is prepared the impairment loss calculation compare the fair value of reporting unit to it carrying amount if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess to the extent of the goodwill balance estimated fair value could change if for example there are change in the business climate change in the competitive environment adverse legal or regulatory action or development change in capital structure cost of debt interest rate capital expenditure level

adversely affect the value of share of our common stock the success of the merger will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefit and cost saving from combining the business of cv health and aetna our ability to realize these anticipated benefit and cost saving is subject to certain risk including our ability to successfully combine the business of cv health and aetna whether the combined business will perform expected the possibility that we paid more for aetna than the value we will derive from the acquisition the reduction of our cash available for operation and

employee the disruption of either company or both company ongoing business or in unexpected integration issue higher than expected integration cost and an overall post completion integration process that take longer than originally anticipated specifically issue that must be addressed in integrating the operation of aetna and cv health in order to realize the anticipated benefit of the merger so the combined business performs expected include among other thing combining the company separate operational financial reporting and corporate function integrating the company technology product and service identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operation and asset harmonizing the company operating practice employee development compensation and benefit program internal control and other policy procedure and process addressing possible difference in business background corporate culture and management philosophy consolidating the company corporate administrative and information technology infrastructure coordinating sale distribution and marketing effort managing the movement of certain business and position to different location maintaining existing agreement with customer provider and vendor and avoiding delay in entering into new agreement with prospective customer provider and vendor operating in industry sector in which we and our current management may have little or no experience coordinating geographically dispersed organization consolidating office of aetna and cv health that are currently in or near the same location and effecting potential action that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approval in addition at time the attention of certain member of each company management and each company resource may be focused on completion of the merger and the integration of the business of the two company and diverted from day to day business operation which may disrupt each company ongoing business and the business of the combined company we have limited experience in the insurance and managed health care industry which may hinder our ability to achieve the combined company objective we have limited experience operating an insurance and managed health care business and will rely in large part on the existing management of aetna to continue to manage the aetna business following the merger however there is no table of content assurance that we will be able to retain the service of such management if we fail to retain the existing management of aetna our ability to realize the anticipated benefit of the transaction may be adversely affected we and aetna may have difficulty attracting motivating and retaining executive and other key employee in light of the merger we will be operating in industry sector for which our existing management team ha little or no experience our success after the transaction will depend in part on our ability to retain key executive and other employee of aetna uncertainty about the effect of the merger on cv health and aetna employee may have an adverse effect on each of and aetna separately and consequently the combined business this uncertainty may impair our and or aetna ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the merger employee of cv health and aetna may experience uncertainty about their future role in the combined business additionally aetna officer and employee may hold aetna common share well aetna stock appreciation right aetna restricted stock unit aetna rsus and aetna performance stock unit aetna psus that are subject to accelerated vesting on change in control and if the merger is completed these officer and employee may be entitled to cash and or the consideration payable under the merger agreement in respect of such aetna common share stock appreciation right aetna rsus and aetna psus these payouts could also make retention of these officer and employee more difficult additionally pursuant to employment agreement and or other agreement or arrangement with aetna certain key employee of aetna are entitled to receive severance payment upon termination without cause and or resignation for good reason following completion of the merger under these agreement certain key employee of aetna potentially could resign from or her employment following specified circumstance set forth in his or her applicable agreement including an adverse change in his or her title authority or responsibility compensation and benefit or primary office location furthermore if key employee of cv health or aetna depart or are at risk of departing including because of issue relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration financial security or desire not to become employee of the combined business we may have to incur significant cost in retaining such individual or in identifying hiring and retaining replacement for departing employee and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to the business of aetna and our ability to realize the anticipated benefit of the merger may be materially and adversely affected accordingly no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract or retain key employee of aetna to the same extent that aetna ha been able to attract or retain employee in the past our and aetna business relationship may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the merger party with which we or aetna do business may experience uncertainty associated with the merger

have material adverse effect on the business financial condition result of operation or prospect of cv health aetna and or the combined business including material adverse effect on our ability to realize the anticipated benefit of the merger the risk and adverse effect of such disruption could be exacerbated by delay in completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement the merger agreement contains provision that may make it more difficult for and aetna to pursue alternative to the merger the merger agreement contains provision that make it more difficult for aetna to sell it business to party other than or for to sell it business these provision include general prohibition on each party soliciting any acquisition proposal further there are only limited exception to each party agreement that it board of director will not withdraw or modify in manner adverse to the other party the recommendation of it board of director in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement in the case of aetna or the approval of the stock issuance in our case and the other party generally ha right to match any acquisition proposal that may be made however at any time prior to the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by aetna shareholder in the case of aetna or the approval of the stock issuance by cv health stockholder in our case such party board of director is permitted to take certain of table of content these action if it determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with it fiduciary duty under applicable law while we believe these provision are reasonable and not preclusive of other offer these restriction might discourage third party that ha an interest in acquiring all or significant part of either aetna or cv health from considering or proposing that acquisition even if that party were prepared to pay consideration with higher per share value than the currently proposed merger consideration in the case of aetna or that party were prepared to enter into an agreement that may be favorable to or our stockholder in our case furthermore the termination fee described below may result in potential competing acquirer proposing to pay lower per share price to acquire the applicable party than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable by such party in certain circumstance failure to complete the merger could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial result if the merger is not completed for any reason including result of aetna shareholder failing to approve and adopt the merger agreement or cv health stockholder failing to approve the stock issuance our ongoing business may be materially and adversely affected and without realizing any of the benefit of having completed the merger we would be subject to number of risk including the following we may experience negative reaction from the financial market including negative impact on the trading price of our common stock and other security and from our customer provider vendor regulator and employee we may be required to pay aetna termination fee of billion if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstance we will be required to pay certain transaction expense and other cost incurred in connection with the merger whether or not the merger is completed the merger agreement place certain restriction on the conduct of our business prior to completion of the merger and such restriction the waiver of which is subject to the consent of aetna may prevent from making certain acquisition taking certain other specified action or otherwise pursuing business opportunity during the pendency of the merger that we would have made taken or pursued if these restriction were not in place and matter relating to the merger including arranging permanent financing and integration planning will require substantial commitment of time and resource by our management and the expenditure of significant fund in the form of fee and expense which would otherwise have been devoted to day to day operation and other opportunity that may have been beneficial to an independent company there can be no assurance that the risk described above will not materialize if any of those risk materialize they may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition financial result rating stock price and or bond price in addition we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or related to any proceeding to specifically enforce our obligation to perform our obligation under the merger agreement if the merger is not completed these risk may materialize and may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition financial result rating stock price and or bond price we and aetna may be target of security class action and derivative lawsuit which could result in substantial cost and may delay or prevent the merger from being completed security class action lawsuit and derivative lawsuit are often brought against public company that have entered into merger agreement even if the lawsuit are without merit defending against these claim can result in substantial cost and divert management time and resource an adverse judgment could result in monetary damage which could have negative impact on our and aetna respective liquidity and financial condition additionally if plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the merger then that injunction may delay or prevent the merger from being completed which may adversely affect our and aetna respective business financial position and result of operation since the filing with the sec of the preliminary joint proxy statement prospectus relating to the proposed merger number of class action lawsuit in connection with the merger have been filed against aetna and aetna table of content director and officer neither we aetna presently believe that there is any merit to any such lawsuit we and aetna intend to defend them vigorously our indebtedness following completion of the merger will be substantially greater than our indebtedness on stand alone basis and greater than the combined indebtedness of cv health and aetna existing prior to the announcement of the transaction this increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business flexibility and increase our borrowing cost downgrade in our rating could adversely affect our business cash flow financial condition and operating result in order to complete the merger we expect to incur acquisition related debt financing of approximately billion and assume aetna existing indebtedness of approximately billion our substantially increased indebtedness and higher debt to equity ratio following completion of the merger in comparison to that of cv health prior to the merger will have the effect among other thing of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic condition and will increase our borrowing cost in addition the amount of cash required to service our increased indebtedness level and thus the demand on our cash resource will be greater than the amount of cash flow required to service the indebtedness of cv health or aetna individually prior to the merger the increased level of indebtedness could also reduce fund available to fund our effort to combine our business with aetna and realize expected benefit of the merger and or engage in investment in product development capital expenditure dividend payment share repurchase and other activity and may create competitive disadvantage for relative to other company with lower debt level in addition our credit rating impact the cost and availability of future borrowing and result our cost of capital our rating reflect each rating organization opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligation or following completion of the merger obligation to the combined company insured each of the rating organization review our rating periodically and there can be no assurance that our current rating will be maintained in the future following the announcement of the merger agreement each of standard poor and moody placed certain of our debt financial strength and other credit rating under review for possible downgrade following the announcement of the merger agreement standard poor best and fitch placed aetna debt financial strength and other credit rating under review with negative implication downgrade in our rating could adversely affect our business cash flow financial condition and operating result in addition if the merger is completed and in certain circumstance aetna debt security are rated below investment grade this may constitute change of control triggering event under the indenture governing such debt upon the occurrence of change of control triggering event aetna the surviving corporation of the merger would be required to offer to repurchase most of aetna outstanding note at of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but not including the date of repurchase however it is possible that aetna or would not have sufficient fund at the time of the change of control triggering event to make the required repurchase of note or that restriction in other debt instrument would not allow such repurchase we can not provide any assurance that there will be sufficient fund available for aetna or to make any required repurchase of the note upon change of control triggering event we will incur significant transaction and integration related cost in connection with the merger we expect to incur number of non recurring cost associated with the merger and combining the operation of the two company we will incur significant transaction cost related to the merger including with respect to the financing for the cash consideration to be paid to aetna shareholder we also will incur significant integration related fee and cost related to formulating and implementing integration plan including facility and system consolidation cost and employment related cost we continue to ass the magnitude of these cost and additional unanticipated cost may be incurred in the merger and the integration of the two company business although we expect that the elimination of duplicative cost well the realization of other efficiency related to the integration of the business should allow to offset integration related cost over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all table of content the merger may not be accretive and may be dilutive to our earnings per share which may negatively affect the market price of share of our common stock we currently project that the merger will result in number of benefit including enhanced competitive positioning and platform from which to accelerate growth and that it will be accretive to earnings per share in the second full year after the close of the transaction this projection is based on preliminary estimate that may materially change in addition future event and condition could decrease or delay the accretion that is currently projected or could result in dilution including adverse change in market condition additional transaction and integration related cost and other factor such the failure to realize some or all of the anticipated benefit of the merger any dilution of decrease in or delay of any accretion to our earnings per share could cause the price of share of our common stock to decline or grow at reduced rate the future result of the combined company may be adversely impacted if the combined company doe not effectively manage it expanded operation following completion of the merger following completion of the merger the size of the combined company business will be significantly larger than the current size of either our or aetna respective business the combined company ability to successfully manage this expanded business will depend in part upon management ability to implement an effective integration of the two company and it ability to manage combined business with significantly larger size and scope with the associated increased cost and complexity there can be no assurance that the management of the combined company will be successful or that the combined company will realize the expected operating efficiency cost saving and other benefit currently anticipated from the merger additional information concerning these risk uncertainty
