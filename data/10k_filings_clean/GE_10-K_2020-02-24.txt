the consolidated financial statement for further information december in billion equipmentservicestotal backlog remaining performance obligation to reported backlog of billion of december are largely driven by adjustment of billion in our aviation segment backlog includes engine contract for which we have received purchase order that are cancelable we have included these in backlog our historical experience ha shown no net cancellation any canceled engine are typically moved by the airframer to other program customer our service backlog includes contract that are cancelable without substantive

global region and provisioning of financial service within these regional economy thus when country or region experience currency and or economic stress we often have increased exposure to certain risk but also often have new opportunity that include among other thing expansion of industrial activity through purchase of company or asset at reduced price and lower debt financing cost financial result of our non activity reported in dollar are affected by currency exchange we use number of technique to manage the effect of currency exchange including selective borrowing in local currency and selective hedging of significant cross currency transaction such principal currency are the euro the pound sterling the brazilian real and the chinese renminbi revenue are classified according to the

renewable energy is increasingly able to compete with fossil fuel in term of levelized cost of electricity however continued competitive pressure from other wind and hydro turbine manufacturer well from other energy source such solar photovoltaic reinforced by general move to electricity auction mechanism have increased price pressure and the need for innovation we continue to invest in exploring new way of further improving the efficiency and flexibility of our hydropower technology with digital solution and in generating wind turbine product improvement including larger rotor taller tower and higher nameplate rating that continue to drive down the cost of wind energy industry model continue to evolve our digital strategy and investment in technical innovation will position to add value for customer looking for clean renewable energy significant trend development renewable energy is in rapid transition period and competing in the marketplace existing and new conventional energy source wind energy is currently the second largest contributor to renewable capacity growth with hydropower projected to remain the largest renewable electricity source through non gaap

shifting to larger more efficient unit to drive down cost and compete with other power generation option despite the competitive nature of the market onshore wind order pricing stabilized in due to demand caused by the progressive phase down of ptcs in the starting in and auction stabilization in international market the phase down of ptcs in the ha recently been extended by year such that certain project completed through could qualify for these credit and we expect to continue high level of production for delivery at onshore wind we will continue to closely monitor our execution during this period including risk of delivery delay due to customer site readiness issue and possible project postponement we expect additional opportunity to repower existing wind turbine repowering allows customer to increase the annual energy output of their installed base provides more competitively priced energy and extends the life of their asset the repower market remains robust and we expect continued strong demand in and beyond the grid market continues to be challenging we have experienced current year order decline in the high voltage direct current hvdc and high voltage hv product line given price pressure the need for grid flexibility to accommodate more renewable energy and the diversification of energy player the hydropower industry continues to maximize value with new small scale and pumped storage project to support both wind and solar expansion the grid and hydro business are executing their turnaround plan and we are expecting improvement in contribution

billion were recorded at corporate and billion and billion were recorded by ge segment for the year ended december and respectively the decrease in ge capital interest and other financial charge for

consolidated information for the year ended december the consolidated income tax provision wa billion the effective tax rate wa negative for reflecting tax expense on consolidated pre tax loss the

asset and the decrease in pre tax loss excluding non deductible goodwill impairment with tax benefit above the average tax rate partially offsetting this increase wa the decrease in the consolidated provision for income tax attributable to an insignificant charge in to adjust the provisional estimate of the impact of the enactment of tax reform compared to the billion charge in for the estimated impact of enactment absent the effect of tax reform and non loss without tax benefit our consolidated income tax provision is generally reduced because of the benefit of lower taxed global operation the benefit from non rate below the statutory rate wa significant prior to the decrease in the statutory rate to beginning in while reduced there is still generally benefit certain non income is subject to local country tax rate that are below the new statutory tax rate the rate of tax on our profitable non earnings is below the statutory tax rate because we have significant business operation subject to tax in country where the tax on that income is lower than the statutory rate and because ge fund certain non operation through foreign company that are subject to low foreign tax most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non business operation and of december we have not decided to repatriate these earnings to the given tax reform substantially all of our prior unrepatriated earnings were subject to tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate available non cash without additional federal tax cost and any foreign withholding tax on repatriation to the would potentially be partially offset by foreign tax credit substantial portion of the benefit for lower taxed non earnings related to business operation subject to tax in country where the tax on that income is lower than the statutory rate is derived from our gecas aircraft leasing operation located in ireland where the earnings are taxed at from our power operation located in switzerland where the earnings are taxed at between and and our healthcare operation in europe where tax deduction are allowed for certain intangible asset and earnings are taxed below the historic statutory rate the rate of tax on non operation is increased however because we also incur loss in foreign jurisdiction where it is not likely that the loss can be utilized and no tax benefit is provided for those loss and valuation allowance against loss carryforwards are provided when it is no longer likely that the loss can be utilized in addition part of tax reform the ha enacted tax on base eroding payment from the we are continuing to undertake restructuring action to mitigate the impact from this provision the ha also enacted minimum tax on foreign earnings global intangible low tax income because we have tangible asset outside the and pay significant foreign tax we generally do not expect significant increase in tax liability from this new minimum tax overall these newly enacted provision increase the rate of tax on our non operation benefit expense from global operation in billion benefit expense of foreign tax rate difference on non earnings of audit other benefit expense amount reported above exclude the impact of tax reform which is reported separate line in the reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the actual tax rate in note to the consolidated financial statement for the year ended december the increase in expense from global operation reflects the tax expense associated with the preparatory internal restructuring for the planned biopharma sale and an increase in valuation allowance on non deferred tax asset offset by benefit from change in foreign rate and by tax benefit from additional guidance on provision enacted part of tax reform for the year ended december the decrease in benefit from lower taxed global operation reflects the lower statutory tax rate and loss without tax benefit the decrease in other benefit reflects increase in incremental valuation allowance on non deferred tax asset and for newly enacted tax on non earnings and the nonrecurrence of benefit associated with repatriation of

within the quarter of the potential liquidity impact of these area may differ described in the following section which provide additional detail regarding the significant credit rating condition of the company debt condition substantially all of our debt agreement do not contain material credit rating covenant if our short term credit rating were to fall below it is possible that we would lose all or part of our access to the tier commercial paper market which would reduce our borrowing capacity in those market this may result in increased utilization of our revolving credit facility to

the effect of this activity on our financial statement other condition where we provide servicing for third party investor under certain of our receivable sale program ge is contractually permitted to commingle cash collected from customer on financing receivables sold to third party investor with our cash prior to payment to third party investor provided our short term credit rating doe not fall below in the event any of our rating were to fall below such level we may be required to segregate certain of these cash collection owed to third party investor into restricted bank account and would lose the short term liquidity benefit of commingling with respect to such collection the financial impact to our intra quarter liquidity would vary based on collection activity for given quarter and may result in increased utilization of our revolving credit facility the loss of cash commingling would have resulted in an estimated maximum reduction of approximately billion to ge intra quarter liquidity during the fourth quarter of in addition we have relied and may continue to rely on securitization program to provide alternative funding for sale of ge receivables to third party investor if any of our short term credit rating were to fall below the timing or amount of liquidity generated by these program could be adversely impacted in the fourth quarter of the estimated maximum reduction to our ending liquidity had our credit rating fallen below these level wa approximately billion foreign exchange and interest rate risk result of our global operation we generate and incur

the effect of foreign currency fluctuation on earnings excluding the earnings impact of the underlying hedged item wa le than billion billion and billion for the year ended december and respectively this analysis excludes any offsetting effect from the forecasted future transaction that are economically hedged ge form acapital resource and liquidity exchange rate and interest rate risk are managed with variety of technique including selective use of derivative we apply policy to manage each of these risk including prohibition on speculative activity following is an analysis of the potential effect of change in interest rate and currency exchange rate it is our policy to minimize exposure to interest rate change and their impact to interest and other financial charge we fund our financial investment using combination of debt and hedging instrument so that the interest rate of our borrowing match the expected interest rate profile on our asset it is our policy to minimize currency exposure and to conduct operation either within functional currency or using the protection of hedge strategy to test the effectiveness of our hedging action for interest rate risk we assumed that on january interest rate decreased by basis point and the decrease remained in place for the next month and for currency risk of asset and liability denominated in other than their functional currency we evaluated the effect of shift in exchange rate against the dollar the analysis indicated that our consolidated net earnings would decline by le than billion for interest rate risk and approximately billion for foreign exchange risk libor reform in connection with the potential transition away from the use of the london interbank offered rate libor an interest rate benchmark we are currently in the process of identifying and managing the potential impact to the company the majority of the company exposure to libor relates to debt security issued by ge capital for which contractual fallback language exists well preferred stock issued by ge substantially all of which convert to libor in january additionally with respect to our derivative portfolio we will review industry wide libor reform effort and expect that such effort will provide guidance on how to manage the transition from libor for derivative statement of cash flow overview from through we manage the cash flow performance of our industrial and financial service business separately we therefore believe it is useful to report separate ge and ge capital column in our statement of cash flow because it enables and our investor to evaluate the cash from operating activity of our industrial business the principal source of cash generation for our industrial business separately from the cash flow of our financial service business well to evaluate the cash flow between our industrial business and ge capital in preparing our statement of cash flow we make certain adjustment to reflect cash flow that can not otherwise be calculated by change in our statement of financial position these adjustment may include but are not limited to the effect of currency exchange acquisition and disposition of

customer predominately within our power and aviation segment that require to maintain the customer asset over the contract term which generally range from to year however contract modification that extend or revise contract are not uncommon we recognize revenue we perform under the arrangement using the percentage of completion method which is based on our cost incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected cost this requires to make estimate of customer payment expected to be received over the contract term well the cost to perform required maintenance service ge form acritical accounting estimate customer generally pay based on the utilization of the asset per hour of usage for example or upon the occurrence of major event within the contract such an overhaul result significant estimate in determining expected revenue of contract is estimating how customer will utilize their asset over the term of the agreement the estimate of utilization which can change over the contract life impact both the amount of customer payment we expect to receive and our estimate of future contract cost customer asset utilization will influence the timing and extent of overhaul and other service event over the life of the contract we generally use combination of both historical utilization trend well forward looking information such market condition and potential asset retirement in developing our revenue estimate to develop our cost estimate we consider the timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul event including the amount and cost of labor spare part and other resource required to perform the service in developing our cost estimate we utilize combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvement cost improvement are only included in future cost estimate after saving have been observed in actual result or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process we routinely review estimate under long term service agreement and regularly revise them to adjust for change in outlook these revision are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review contract modification that change the right and obligation well the nature timing and extent of future cash flow are evaluated for potential price concession contract asset impairment and significant financing to determine if adjustment of earnings are required effectively accounting for modified contract new contract we regularly ass expected billing adjustment and customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amount of receivables and contract asset including the risk that contractual penalty may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination we gain insight into future utilization and cost trend well credit risk through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and the close interaction with our customer that come with supplying critical service and part over extended period revision may affect long term service agreement total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings on december our net long term service agreement balance of billion represents approximately of our total estimated life of contract billing of billion our contract on average are approximately complete based on cost incurred to date and our estimate of future cost revision to our estimate of future billing or cost that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by one percentage point would increase or decrease the long term service agreement balance by billion cash billing collected on these contract were billion and billion during the year ended december and respectively see note and to the consolidated financial statement for further information impairment of goodwill and other identified intangible asset during and in order to improve alignment of our annual goodwill impairment testing and strategic planning process we changed our annual testing date from the third quarter to the fourth quarter we determine fair value for each of the reporting unit using the market approach when available and appropriate or the income approach or combination of both we ass the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation if multiple valuation methodology are used the result are weighted appropriately valuation using the market approach are derived from metric of publicly traded company or historically completed transaction of comparable business the selection of comparable business is based on the market in which the reporting unit operate giving consideration to risk profile size geography and diversity of product and service market approach is limited to reporting unit for which there are publicly traded company that have the characteristic similar to our business under the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flow discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted rate we use our internal forecast to estimate future cash flow and include an estimate of long term future growth rate based on our most recent view of the long term outlook for each business actual result may differ from those assumed in our forecast we derive our discount rate using capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rate for industry relevant to our reporting unit to estimate the cost of equity financing we use discount rate that are commensurate with the risk and uncertainty inherent in the respective business and in our internally developed forecast discount rate used in our annual reporting unit valuation ranged from to estimating the fair value of reporting unit requires the use of significant judgment that are based on number of factor including actual operating result internal forecast market observable pricing multiple of similar business and comparable transaction possible control premium determining the appropriate discount rate and long term growth rate assumption and if multiple approach are being used determining the appropriate weighting applied to each approach it is reasonably possible that the judgment and estimate described above could change in future period we review identified intangible asset with defined useful life and subject to amortization for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss ha occurred requires the use of our internal forecast to estimate future cash flow and the useful life over which these cash flow will occur to determine fair value we use our internal cash flow estimate discounted at an appropriate discount rate see note and to the consolidated financial statement for further information ge form acritical accounting estimate insurance and investment contract refer to the other item insurance section within md for further discussion of the accounting estimate and assumption in our insurance reserve and their sensitivity to change also see note and to the consolidated financial statement for further information pension assumption our defined benefit pension plan are accounted for on an actuarial basis which requires the selection of various assumption including discount rate an expected return on asset mortality rate of participant and expectation of mortality improvement we evaluate these critical assumption at least annually on plan and country specific basis we periodically evaluate other assumption involving demographic factor such retirement age and turnover and update them to reflect our experience and expectation for the future actual result in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumption because of economic and other factor projected benefit obligation are measured the present value of expected payment we discount those cash payment using the weighted average of market observed yield for high quality fixed income security with maturity that correspond to the payment of benefit lower discount rate increase present value and generally increase subsequent year pension expense higher discount rate decrease present value and generally reduce subsequent year pension expense our discount rate for principal pension plan at december and were and respectively reflecting market interest rate to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan asset we consider our asset allocation well historical and expected return on various category of plan asset in developing future long term return expectation for our principal benefit plan asset we formulate view on the future economic environment both in the and abroad we evaluate general market trend and historical relationship among number of key variable that impact asset class return such expected earnings growth inflation valuation yield and spread using both internal and external source we also take into account expected volatility by asset class and diversification across class to determine expected overall portfolio result given our asset allocation asset in our principal pension plan earned in and had annualized return of and in the and year period ended december respectively based on our analysis of future expectation of asset performance past return result and our asset allocation we have assumed long term expected return on those asset for cost recognition in compared to in and the society of actuary issued new base and improvement mortality table in and we updated mortality assumption in the accordingly these change in assumption decreased the december pension and retiree benefit plan obligation by billion change in key assumption for our principal pension plan would have the following effect discount rate basis point decrease in discount rate would increase pension cost in the following year by about billion and would increase the pension benefit obligation at year end by about billion expected return on asset basis point decrease in the expected return on asset would increase pension cost in the following year by about billion see other consolidated information postretirement benefit plan section within md and note to the consolidated financial statement for further information income tax our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rate and tax planning opportunity available to in the various jurisdiction in which we operate tax law are complex and subject to different interpretation by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authority significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax position including evaluating uncertainty we review our tax position quarterly and adjust the balance new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operation in addition to local country tax law and regulation this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the historically tax were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings due to the enactment of tax reform most repatriation of foreign earnings will be free of federal income tax but may incur withholding or state tax indefinite reinvestment is determined by management judgment about and intention concerning the future operation of the company most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non business operation at december we have not changed our indefinite reinvestment decision result of tax reform but will reassess this on an ongoing basis ge form acritical accounting estimate deferred income tax asset represent amount available to reduce income tax payable on taxable income in future year such asset arise because of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability well from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deduction and credit by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategy these source of income rely heavily on estimate we use our historical experience and our short and long range business forecast to provide insight further our global and diversified business portfolio give the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategy to facilitate the recoverability of future deduction amount recorded for deferred tax asset related to non net operating loss net of valuation allowance were billion and billion at december and including billion

resulting from other event and development when loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss when there appears to be range of possible cost with equal likelihood liability are based on the low end of such range however the likelihood of loss with respect to particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining meaningful estimate of the loss or range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future event and negotiation with or decision by third party that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency moreover it is not uncommon for such matter to be resolved over many year during which time relevant development and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate range of possible loss disclosure is provided for material loss contingency when loss is probable but reasonable estimate can not be made and when it is reasonably possible that loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount

inflation protection option increase the daily maximum to protect the policyholder from the rising cost of care with some option providing automatic annual increase of to or policyholder elected inflation indexed increase for increased premium joint life policy provide coverage for two life which permit either life under single contract to receive benefit at the same time or separately and

in throughout the remaining life of contract unless premium deficiency develops ge form aother item claim reserve claim reserve are established when claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred and represents our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligation for future claim payment and claim adjustment expense key input include actual known fact about the claim such the benefit available and cause of disability of the claimant well assumption derived from our actual historical experience and expected future change in experience factor claim reserve are evaluated periodically for potential change in loss estimate with the support of qualified actuary and any change are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined reinsurance recoverables we cede insurance risk to third party reinsurers for portion of our insurance contract primarily on long term care insurance policy and record receivables we are not relieved from our primary obligation to policyholder or cedents these receivables are estimated in manner consistent with the future policy benefit reserve and claim reserve reserve ceded to reinsurers net of allowance were billion and billion at december and december respectively and are included in the caption other ge capital receivables on our consolidated statement of financial position premium deficiency testing we annually perform premium deficiency testing in the third quarter in the aggregate across our run off insurance portfolio the premium deficiency testing ass the adequacy of future policy benefit reserve net of unamortized capitalized acquisition cost using current assumption without provision for adverse deviation comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumption is complex process and depends on number of factor many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance product the vast majority of our run off insurance operation consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entity pursuant to treaty having complex term and condition premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entity and considers the reinsurance treaty and underlying policy in order to utilize that information for purpose of completing experience study covering all key assumption we perform detailed procedure to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entity our long term care insurance business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained age is still emerging and to the extent future experience deviate from current expectation new projection of claim cost extending over the expected life of the policy may be required significant uncertainty exist in making projection for these long term care insurance contract which requires that we consider wide range of possible outcome the primary assumption used in the premium deficiency test include morbidity morbidity assumption used in estimating future policy benefit reserve are based on estimate of expected incidence of disability among policyholder and the cost associated with these policyholder asserting claim under their contract and these estimate account for any expected future morbidity improvement for long term care exposure estimating expected future cost includes assessment of incidence probability of claim utilization amount of available benefit expected to be incurred and continuance how long the claim will last prior to premium deficiency assumption considered the risk of anti selection by including issue age adjustment to morbidity based on an actuarial assumption that long term care policy issued to younger individual would exhibit lower expected incidence and claim cost than those issued to older policyholder recent claim experience and the development of reconstructed claim cost curve indicated issue age difference had minimal impact on claim cost projection and accordingly beginning in issue age adjustment were eliminated in developing morbidity assumption higher morbidity increase while lower morbidity decrease the present value of expected future benefit payment rate of change in morbidity our annual premium deficiency testing incorporates our best estimate of projected future change in the morbidity rate reflected in our base cost curve these estimate draw upon number of input some of which are subjective and all of which are interpreted and applied in the exercise of professional actuarial judgment in the context of the characteristic specific to our portfolio this exercise of judgment considers factor such the work performed by internal and external independent actuarial expert engaged to advise in our annual testing the observed actual experience in our portfolio measured against our base projection industry development and other trend including advance in the state of medical care and health care technology development with respect to industry development we take into account that there are difference between and among industry peer in portfolio characteristic such demographic feature of the insured population the aggregate effect of improvement or deterioration applied to base claim cost projection the extent to which such base cost projection reflect the most current experience and the accepted diversity of practice in actuarial professional judgment we ass the potential for any change in morbidity with reference to our existing base claim cost projection reconstructed in projected improvement or deterioration in morbidity can have material impact on our future claim cost projection both on stand alone basis and also by virtue of influencing other variable such discount rate and premium rate increase mortality mortality assumption used in estimating future policy benefit reserve are based on published mortality table adjusted for the result of our experience study and estimate of expected future mortality improvement for life insurance product higher mortality increase the present value of expected future benefit payment while for annuity and long term care insurance contract higher mortality decrease the present value of expected future benefit payment discount rate interest rate assumption used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserve are based on expected investment yield net of related investment expense and expected default in estimating future yield we consider the actual yield on our current investment security held by our run off insurance operation and the future rate at which we expect to reinvest any proceeds from investment security maturity net of other operating cash flow and the projected future capital contribution into our run off insurance operation lower future yield result in lower discount rate and higher present value of future policy benefit reserve ge form aother item future long term care premium rate increase reinsurer we rely upon the primary insurer that issued the underlying policy to file proposed premium rate increase on those policy with the relevant state insurance regulator we have no ability to seek or to institute such premium rate increase we consider recent experience of rate increase filing made by our ceding company along with state insurance regulatory process and precedent in establishing our current expectation higher future premium rate increase lower the present value of future policy benefit reserve termination termination refers to the rate at which the underlying policy is canceled due to either mortality lapse non payment of premium by policyholder or in the case of long term care insurance benefit exhaustion termination rate assumption used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserve are based on the result of our experience study and reflect actuarial judgment lower termination rate increase while higher termination rate decrease the present value of expected future benefit payment in based on elevated claim experience for portion of our long term care insurance contract we initiated comprehensive review of all premium deficiency testing assumption across all insurance product resulting in reconstruction of our future claim cost projection for long term care insurance product our internal claim experience ha been consistent with those reconstructed projection although the extent of actual experience since to date is limited in the context of long tailed multi decade portfolio premium deficiency testing we annually perform premium deficiency testing in the aggregate across our run off insurance portfolio we performed this year testing in the third quarter of consistent with our historical practice prior to when we reconstructed our claim cost curve these procedure included updating experience study since our last test completed in the fourth quarter of independent actuarial analysis and review of industry benchmark we experienced premium deficiency in our premium deficiency testing started with zero margin and accordingly any net adverse development would result in future charge to earnings using our most recent future policy benefit reserve assumption including change to our assumption related to discount rate and future premium rate increase we identified premium deficiency resulting in billion pre tax charge to earnings in the third quarter the increase to future policy benefit reserve resulting from our testing wa primarily attributable to the significant decline in market interest rate we observed this year which ha resulted in lower discount rate and adversely impacted our reserve margin by billion and higher level of projected long term care premium rate increase due to larger rate filing by some ceding company than previously planned which favorably impacted our reserve margin by billion our discount rate assumption for purpose of performing the premium deficiency assessment resulted in weighted average rate of compared to in this decline in the discount rate from to reflected lower reinvestment rate increasing to an expected long term average investment yield over longer period lower prospective expected return on higher yielding asset class introduced with our strategic initiative and slightly lower actual yield on our investment security portfolio noted above our observed claim experience in the period since the reconstruction of our future long term care claim cost projection ha been consistent with those projection based on the application of professional actuarial judgment to the factor discussed above we have made no substantial change to our assumption concerning morbidity morbidity improvement mortality mortality improvement or termination in with all assumption underlying our premium deficiency testing we will continue to monitor these factor which may result in future change in our assumption see note to the consolidated financial statement for further information on the result of our premium deficiency testing gaap reserve sensitivity the result of our premium deficiency testing are sensitive to the assumption described above certain future adverse change in our assumption could result in the unlocking of reserve resetting of actuarial assumption to current assumption an increase to future policy benefit reserve and charge to earnings considering the result of the premium deficiency test which reset our margin to zero any future net adverse change in our assumption will result in an increase to future policy benefit reserve for example adverse change in key assumption to our future policy benefit reserve holding all other assumption constant would have the following effect presented in the table below any favorable change to these assumption could result in additional margin in our premium deficiency test and higher income over the remaining duration of the portfolio including higher investment income the assumption within our future policy benefit reserve are subject to significant uncertainty including those inherent in the complex nature of our reinsurance treaty many of our assumption are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance product small change in the amount used in the sensitivity or the use of different

insurance topic targeted improvement to the accounting for long duration contract in october the fasb affirmed it decision to defer the effective date to period beginning after december with an election to adopt early we are evaluating the effect of the standard on our consolidated financial statement and anticipate that it adoption will significantly change the accounting for measurement of our long duration insurance liability the asu requires cash flow assumption used in the measurement of various insurance liability to be reviewed at least annually and updated if actual experience or other evidence indicates previous assumption need to be revised with any required change recorded in earnings under the current accounting guidance the discount rate is based on expected investment yield while under the asu the discount rate will be equivalent to the upper medium grade single fixed income instrument yield reflecting the duration characteristic of the liability and is required to be updated in each reporting period with change recorded in other comprehensive income in measuring the insurance liability under the new standard contract shall not be grouped together from different issue year these change result in the elimination of premium deficiency testing and shadow adjustment while we continue to evaluate the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting we anticipate that the adoption of the asu will materially affect our financial statement the asu is only applicable to the measurement of our long duration insurance liability under gaap it will not affect the accounting for our insurance reserve or the level of capital and surplus under statutory accounting practice in june the fasb issued asu no financial instrument credit loss topic measurement of credit loss on financial instrument the asu introduces new accounting model the current expected credit loss model cecl which requires earlier recognition of credit loss and additional disclosure related to credit risk the cecl model utilizes lifetime expected credit loss measurement objective for the recognition of credit loss for loan and other receivables at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired the expected credit loss are adjusted each period for change in expected lifetime credit loss this model replaces the multiple existing impairment model in current gaap which generally require that loss be incurred before it is recognized the new standard also applies to receivables arising from revenue transaction such contract asset and account receivables well reinsurance recoverables at ge capital run off insurance operation and is effective for fiscal year beginning after december the standard will be applied prospectively with an adjustment to retained earnings we finalize our process we expect the adoption of the asu to have an effect of approximately billion to retained earnings other we own or hold license to use numerous

looking statement section these risk factor may be important to understanding any statement in this form report or elsewhere the risk described below should not be considered complete list of potential risk that we may face the following information should be read in conjunction with the md section and the consolidated financial statement and related note the risk we describe in this form report or in our other sec filing could have material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and result of operation and they could cause our future result to be materially different than we presently anticipate strategic risk strategic risk relates to the company future business plan and strategy including the risk associated with the global macro environment our portfolio of business and capital allocation decision disposition acquisition joint venture and restructuring activity competitive threat the demand for our product and service and the success of our investment in technology and innovation intellectual property and other risk global macro environment our growth is subject to global economic political and geopolitical risk we operate in virtually every part of the world serve customer in over country and received of our revenue for from outside the united state our operation and the execution of our business plan and strategy are subject to the effect of global economic trend competition and geopolitical risk and demand or supply shock from war natural disaster health pandemic or other event they are also affected by local and regional economic environment and policy in the and other market that we serve including interest rate monetary policy inflation economic growth recession commodity price currency volatility currency control or other limitation on the ability to expatriate cash debt level and actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt for example change in local economic condition or outlook such lower rate of investment or economic growth in china europe or other key market affect the demand for or profitability of our product and service outside the and the impact on the company could be significant given the extent of our activity outside the united state political change and trend such populism protectionism economic nationalism and sentiment toward multinational company and resulting change to trade tax or other law and policy including tariff have been and may continue to be disruptive and costly to our business and can interfere with our global operating model supply chain production cost customer relationship and competitive position further escalation of specific trade tension such those between the and china or in global trade conflict more broadly could lead to significant deterioration of global growth and related decrease in confidence or investment activity in the global market would adversely affect our business performance we also do business in many emerging market jurisdiction where economic political and legal risk are heightened while some type of these economic risk can be hedged using derivative or other financial instrument and some are insurable such attempt to mitigate these risk are costly and not always successful ge form factor portfolio strategy execution our success depends on achieving our strategic and financial objective including through disposition we are pursuing variety of disposition including the planned sale of our biopharma business within our healthcare segment and exiting our remaining equity ownership position in baker hughes the proceeds that we expect to receive from such action are an important source of cash flow for the company part of our strategic and financial planning we seek to sell certain business equity interest or asset we may encounter difficulty in finding buyer managing interdependency across multiple transaction and other company initiative or implementing separation plan which could delay or prevent the accomplishment of our strategic and financial objective including our goal of reducing the company leverage to targeted level over time in particular some of the disposition strategy that we are considering or may consider depend on favorable condition in the capital market or private acquisition financing market for execution and decline in the value of equity interest such our remaining interest in baker hughes or other asset that we sell can diminish the cash proceeds that we realize we may dispose of business or asset at price or on term that are le favorable than we had anticipated or with purchase price adjustment or the exclusion of asset or liability that must be divested managed or run off separately we are also subject to limitation in the form of regulatory or governmental approval that may prevent certain prospective purchaser from completing transaction with or delay from executing transaction on our preferred timeline or arising from our debt or other contractual obligation that limit our ability to complete certain business or asset disposition moreover recent and planned disposition have the effect of reducing the company cash flow and earnings capacity resulting in le diversified portfolio of business and increasing our dependency on remaining business for our financial result from ongoing operation executing on these transaction can divert senior management time and resource from other pursuit disposition or other business separation also often involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such through continuing equity ownership retained asset or liability transition service agreement commercial agreement guarantee indemnity or other current or contingent financial obligation or liability under these arrangement performance by the divested business or other condition outside our control could materially affect our future financial result with respect to acquisition joint venture and business integration we may not achieve expected return and other benefit result of change in strategy or separation integration challenge related to personnel it system or other factor in addition in connection with acquisition over time we have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible asset on our balance sheet and if we are not able to realize the value of these asset we may be required to incur charge relating to the impairment of these asset we also participate in number of joint venture with other company or government enterprise in various market around the world including joint venture where we have lesser degree of control over the business operation which may expose to additional operational financial legal or compliance risk competitive environment we are dependent on the maintenance of existing product line and service relationship market acceptance of new product and service introduction and technology and innovation leadership for revenue and earnings growth the market in which we operate are highly competitive in term of pricing product and service quality product development and introduction time customer service financing term and shift in market demand and competitor are increasingly offering service for our installed base our long term operating result and competitive position depend substantially upon our ability to continually develop introduce and market new and innovative product service and platform to modify existing product and service to customize product and service to increase our productivity we perform on long term service agreement and to anticipate and respond to market and technological change driven by trend such increased digitization or automation or by development such climate change that present both risk and opportunity for our business failure to appropriately plan for future customer demand and industry trend may adversely affect our delivery of product service and outcome in line with our projected financial performance or cost estimate and ultimately may result in excess cost build up of inventory that becomes obsolete lower profit margin and an erosion of our competitive position for example the significant decrease in recent year in the levelized cost of renewable source of power generation such wind and solar along with ongoing change in investor and consumer preference and consideration related to climate change affect the demand for and the competitiveness of our product and service related to fossil fuel based power generation and further change over time could have material adverse effect on the performance of those business and our consolidated result these trend and the relative competitiveness of different type of product and service offering will continue to be impacted in way that are uncertain by factor such the pace of technological development and related cost consideration the level of economic growth in different market around the world and the adoption of climate change related policy such carbon tax cap and trade regime increased efficiency standard or incentive or mandate for particular type of energy at the national and sub national level or by private actor our business are also subject to technological change and require to continually attract and retain skilled talent the introduction of innovative and disruptive technology in the market in which we operate also pose risk in the form of new competitor including new entrant from outside our traditional industry market consolidation substitution of existing product service or solution niche player new business model and competitor that are faster to market with new or more cost effective product or service because the research and development cycle involved in bringing product in our business to market is often lengthy it is inherently difficult to predict the economic condition and competitive dynamic that will exist when any new product is complete and our investment may generate weaker return than we anticipated at the outset our capacity to invest in research and development effort to pursue advancement in wide range of technology product and service also depends on the financial resource that we have available for such investment relative to other capital allocation priority and under investment could lead to the loss of sale of our product and service the amount that we do invest in research and development divert resource from other potential investment in our business and our effort may not lead to the development of new technology or product on timely basis or meet the need of our customer fully competitive offering ge form factor restructuring personnel we have been undertaking extensive cost reduction and restructuring effort these effort may have adverse effect on our operation employee retention result and reputation and may not achieve the expected benefit we continue undertaking restructuring action that include workforce reduction global facility consolidation and other cost reduction initiative these action are central component of our ongoing effort to improve operational and financial performance the extent of change across our organizational structure senior leadership culture functional alignment outsourcing and other area pose risk in the form of personnel capacity constraint and institutional knowledge loss that could lead to missed performance or financial target loss of key personnel and harm to our reputation the risk of capacity constraint is also heightened with the number of interdependent and transformational business portfolio and internal action that we have been undertaking during period of significant restructuring and cost reduction across the company moreover if we do not successfully manage our restructuring and other transformational activity the anticipated operational improvement efficiency and other benefit might be delayed or not realized and our operation and business could be disrupted risk associated with these action include unforeseen delay in implementation of workforce reduction additional unexpected cost adverse effect on employee morale loss of key employee or other retention issue inability to attract and hire talented professional or the failure to meet operational target due to the loss of employee or work stoppage any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reduction or may otherwise harm our business or reputation and have an adverse effect on our competitive position or financial performance intellectual property our intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitor from independently developing product and service similar to or duplicative to and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted by external dependency our patent and other intellectual property may not prevent competitor from independently developing or selling product and service similar to or duplicative of ours and there can be no assurance that the resource invested by to protect our intellectual property will be sufficient or that our intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of our technology trademark license of the ge brand in connection with disposition may negatively impact the overall value of the brand in the future result of increased number of employee exit due to restructuring activity or otherwise we also face heightened risk related to the loss or unauthorized use of the company intellectual property or other protected data we also face competition in some country where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio if we are not able to protect our intellectual property the value of our brand and other intangible asset may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected we also face attempt to gain unauthorized access to our it system or product for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secret or confidential business information the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secret and other confidential business information result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and the value of our investment in research and development in addition we are subject to the enforcement of patent or other intellectual property by third party including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claim by non practicing entity regardless of the merit of such claim responding to infringement claim can be expensive and time consuming if ge is found to infringe any third party right we could be required to pay substantial damage or we could be enjoined from offering some of our product and service the value of or our ability to use our intellectual property may also be negatively impacted by dependency on third party such our ability to obtain or renew on reasonable term license that we need in the future or our ability to secure or retain ownership or right to use data in certain software analytics or service offering operational risk operational risk relates to risk arising from system process people and external event that affect the operation of our business it includes risk related to product and service lifecycle and execution product safety and performance information management and data protection and security including cybersecurity and supply chain and business disruption operational execution operational challenge could have material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and result of operation the company financial result depend on the successful execution of our business operating plan across all step of the product and service lifecycle for example we continue working to improve the operation and execution of our power and renewable energy business and our ability to effect the desired operational turnaround will be significant factor in determining the financial performance of the company whole in addition we have dependency on the continued strength and successful operating plan execution of our other business particularly aviation during this period of operational improvement operational failure that result in quality problem or potential product environmental health or safety risk could have material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and result of operation in addition portion of our business particularly within our power and renewable energy business involves large project where we take on or are member of consortium responsible for the full scope of engineering procurement construction or other service these type of project often pose unique risk related to their location scale complexity duration and pricing or payment structure performance issue or schedule delay can arise due to inadequate technical expertise unanticipated project modification development at project site environmental health and safety issue execution by or coordination with supplier subcontractor or consortium partner financial difficulty of our customer or significant partner or compliance with government regulation and these can lead to cost overrun contractual penalty liquidated damage and other adverse consequence where ge is member of consortium we are typically subject to claim based on joint and several liability and claim can extend to aspect of the project or cost that are not directly related or limited to ge scope of work operational quality or other issue at large project or across our project portfolio more broadly can adversely affect ge business reputation or result of operation ge form factor product safety our product and service are highly sophisticated and specialized and major failure or similar event affecting our product or third party product with which our product are integrated can adversely affect our business reputation financial position and result of operation we produce highly sophisticated product and provide specialized service for both our own and third party product that incorporate or use complex or leading edge technology including both hardware and software many of our product and service involve complex industrial machinery or infrastructure project such commercial jet engine gas turbine onshore and offshore wind turbine or nuclear power generation and accordingly the impact of catastrophic product failure or similar event could be significant in particular actual or perceived design or production issue related to new product introduction or relatively new product line can result in significant reputational harm to our business in addition to direct warranty maintenance and other cost that may arise significant product issue resulting in injury or death widespread outage fleet grounding or similar systemic consequence could have material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and result of operation we may also incur increased cost delayed payment or lost equipment or service revenue in connection with significant issue with third party product with which our product are integrated for example the leap engine that our aviation business develops produce and sell through cfm is the exclusive engine for the boeing max which ha been subject to global fleet grounding since march following two fatal crash that were unrelated to the leap engine the max grounding had an adverse effect on ge cfoa in and uncertainty related to the timing for the max return to service and future engine production rate pose material risk for our aviation business and ge overall financial outlook and result for further information regarding the effect of the max grounding on ge cfoa see the aviation and gecas max section in consolidated result within md while we have built operational process to ensure that our product design manufacture performance and servicing meet rigorous quality standard there can be no assurance that we or our customer or other third party will not experience operational process or product failure and other problem including through manufacturing or design defect process or other failure of contractor or third party supplier cyber attack or other intentional act that could result in potential product safety quality regulatory or environmental risk cybersecurity increased cybersecurity requirement vulnerability threat and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose risk to our system network product solution service and data increased global cybersecurity vulnerability threat computer virus and more sophisticated and targeted cyber related attack well cybersecurity failure resulting from human error and technological error pose risk to the security of ge and it customer partner supplier and third party service provider infrastructure product system and network and the confidentiality availability and integrity of ge and it customer data the perpetrator of such attack become more capable including sophisticated state or state affiliated actor and critical infrastructure is increasingly becoming digitized the risk in this area continue to grow while we attempt to mitigate these risk by employing number of measure including employee training monitoring and testing and maintenance of protective system and contingency plan we remain vulnerable to known or unknown threat and there is no assurance that the impact from such threat will not be material in addition to existing risk the adoption of new technology in the future may also increase our exposure to cybersecurity breach and failure we also have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information in certain of our business that is subject to privacy and security law regulation or customer imposed control despite our use of reasonable and appropriate control to protect our system and sensitive confidential or personal data or information we have vulnerability to security breach theft misplaced lost or corrupted data programming error employee error and or malfeasance including misappropriation by departing employee that could potentially lead to material compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our system software solution or network unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective product production downtime and operational disruption data privacy and protection law are evolving can vary significantly by country and present increasing compliance challenge which increase our cost affect our competitiveness and can expose to substantial fine or other penalty in addition significant cyber related attack could result in other negative consequence including damage to our reputation or competitiveness remediation or increased protection cost litigation or regulatory action supply chain significant raw material shortage supplier capacity constraint supplier or customer production disruption supplier quality and sourcing issue or price increase can increase our operating cost and adversely impact the competitive position of our product our reliance on third party supplier contract manufacturer and service provider and commodity market to secure raw material part component and sub system used in our product expose to volatility in the price and availability of these material part component system and service our supply chain extend into many different country and region around the world we are also subject to global economic and geopolitical dynamic and risk associated with exporting component manufactured in particular country for incorporation into finished product completed in other country in addition some of our supplier or their sub supplier are limited or sole source supplier we also have internal dependency on certain key ge manufacturing or other facility disruption in delivery from key ge facility or from our third party supplier contract manufacturer or outsourced or other service provider capacity constraint production disruption up or down stream price increase or decreased availability of raw material or commodity including result of war natural disaster health pandemic or other business continuity event adversely affect our operation and depending on the length and severity of the disruption can limit our ability to meet our commitment to customer or significantly impact our operating profit or cash flow for example we are monitoring the impact across our business of the recent coronavirus outbreak which ha already caused disruption to production facility and activity in china and the severity of the operational and financial impact will depend on how long and widespread the disruption prof to be quality capability compliance and sourcing issue experienced by third party provider can also adversely affect our cost margin rate and the quality and effectiveness of our product and service and result in liability and reputational harm in addition while we require our supplier to implement and maintain reasonable and appropriate control to protect information we provide to them they may be the victim of cyber related attack that could lead to the compromise of the company intellectual property personal data or other confidential information or to production downtime and operational disruption that could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitment to customer ge form factor financial risk financial risk relates to our ability to meet financial obligation and mitigate exposure to broad market risk including funding and liquidity risk such risk related to our credit rating and our availability and cost of funding credit risk and volatility in foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and commodity price liquidity risk refers to the potential inability to meet contractual or contingent financial obligation whether on or off balance sheet they arise and could potentially impact an institution financial condition or overall safety and soundness credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from customer or counterparty failure to meet it contractual obligation and we face credit risk arising from both our industrial business and from ge capital leverage borrowing our indebtedness level could limit the flexibility of our business and we could face further constraint result of failing to decrease our leverage over time further downgrade of our credit rating or adverse market condition our ability to decrease our leverage planned is dependent on the proceeds that we generate from business and asset disposition well our cash flow from operation de leveraging and servicing our debt will require significant amount of cash and if we are unable to generate cash flow in accordance with our plan we may be required to adopt one or more alternative such increasing borrowing under credit line further reducing or delaying investment or capital expenditure selling other business or asset refinancing debt or raising additional equity capital in particular we have significant pension and run off insurance liability that are sensitive to numerous factor and assumption that we use in our pension liability gaap insurance reserve and insurance statutory calculation for example the impact of low or declining market interest rate on the discount rate that we use to calculate these long term liability holding other variable constant can adversely affect our earnings and cash flow well the pace of progress toward our leverage goal for ge and for ge capital lower than expected disposition proceeds or cash generation by our business over time could also adversely affect our progress toward our leverage goal our indebtedness could put at competitive disadvantage compared to competitor with lower debt level that may have greater financial flexibility to secure additional funding for their operation pursue strategic acquisition finance long term project or take other action continuing to have substantial indebtedness could also have the consequence of increasing our vulnerability to general economic condition such slowing economic growth or recession it could also increase our vulnerability to adverse industry specific condition or to increase in the capital or liquidity need at the ge or ge capital level and it could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to change in the economy and the industry in which we compete in addition our existing level of indebtedness may impair our ability to obtain additional debt financing on favorable term in the future particularly if coupled with further downgrade of our credit rating or deterioration of capital market condition more generally external condition in the financial and credit market may limit the availability of funding at particular time or increase the cost of funding which could adversely affect our business financial position and result of operation factor that may affect the availability of funding or cause an increase in our funding cost include market disruption arising in the united state europe china emerging market or other market currency movement or other factor liquidity failure to meet our cash flow target or additional credit downgrade could adversely affect our liquidity funding cost and related margin we rely on cash from operation and proceeds from business and asset disposition well access to the short and long term debt market to fund our operation maintain contingency buffer of liquidity and meet our financial obligation and capital allocation priority if we do not meet our cash flow objective through both improved cash performance in our business or successful execution of business and asset disposition our financial condition could be adversely affected our access to the debt market and to the commercial paper market in particular depends on our credit rating result of rating action by moody and fitch in ge transitioned to tier commercial paper issuer which reduced our borrowing capacity in the commercial paper market that we historically relied on significantly to fund our operation on an intra quarter basis to accommodate ge short term liquidity need we have been increasing utilization of our revolving credit facility substitute for commercial paper borrowing which result in an overall increase to our cost of fund ge form factor there can also be no assurance that we will not face additional credit downgrade result of factor such our progress in decreasing our leverage the performance of our business the failure to execute on disposition or change in rating application or methodology future downgrade could further adversely affect our cost of fund and related margin liquidity competitive position and access to capital market and significant downgrade could have an adverse commercial impact on our industrial business for example if our short term credit rating were to fall below it is possible that we would lose all or part of our access to the tier commercial paper market and therefore our borrowing capacity in the commercial paper market would likely be further reduced further we have relied and may continue to rely on securitization program to provide alternative funding for sale of ge receivables to third party investor if any of our short term credit rating were to fall below the timing or amount of liquidity generated by these program could be adversely affected in addition in certain securitization transaction where we provide servicing for third party investor we are contractually permitted to commingle cash collected from customer on financing receivables sold or pledged to third party investor with our own cash prior to making required payment to third party investor provided our short term credit rating doe not fall below in the event our rating were to fall below such level we would be required to segregate certain of these cash collection owed to third party investor into restricted bank account and would lose the short term liquidity benefit of commingling with respect to such collection in addition under various debt and derivative instrument guarantee and covenant we could be required to post additional capital or collateral in the event of rating downgrade which would increase the impact of rating downgrade on our liquidity and capital position swap forward and option contract are executed under standard master agreement that typically contain mutual downgrade provision that provide the ability of the counterparty to require termination if the credit rating of the applicable ge entity were to fall below specified rating level agreed upon with the counterparty primarily bbb for additional discussion about our current credit rating and related consideration refer to the capital resource and liquidity credit rating and condition section within md economy customer counterparties deterioration in condition in the global economy the major industry we serve or the financial market or in the soundness of financial institution government or customer we deal with can adversely affect our business and result of operation the business and operating result of our industrial business have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic condition including condition in the air transportation power generation renewable energy healthcare and other industry we serve existing or potential customer may delay or cancel plan to purchase our product and service including large infrastructure project and may not be able to fulfill their obligation to in timely fashion result of business deterioration cash flow shortage or difficulty obtaining financing for particular project or due to macroeconomic condition geopolitical disruption change in law or other challenge affecting the strength of the global economy the airline industry for example is highly cyclical and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the and international economy an extended disruption of regional or international travel such disruption in connection with terrorist incident health pandemic or recessionary economic environment that result in the loss of business and leisure traffic could have material adverse effect on our airline customer the viability of their business and their demand for our product and service such effect would be particularly significant for ge in the current environment in which we have dependency on the continued strength of our aviation business we execute on planned disposition and continue working to improve the operation and execution of other ge business secular cyclical and competitive pressure facing customer across our energy business can also have significant impact on the operating result and outlook for our business these include pressure such lower demand in our power business than in the past result of increased cost competitiveness and market penetration by renewable source of power generation the effect of change in production or other tax credit for wind energy project and significant price competition among wind equipment manufacturer and consolidation in the industry and shift in the availability of financing for certain type of project investor government regulator and other market participant develop plan for addressing climate change in particular our ability to effect an operational turnaround in our power business will be more challenging to the extent that market for our product and service remain lower for longer than expected further our vendor may experience similar condition which may impact their ability to fulfill their obligation to we also at time face greater challenge collecting on receivables with customer that are sovereign government or located in emerging market if there is significant deterioration in the global economy our result of operation financial position and cash flow could be materially adversely affected ge form factor ge capital smaller ge capital continues to have exposure to insurance credit and other risk and in the event of future adverse development may not be able to meet it business and financial objective without further action at ge capital or additional capital contribution by ge to fund the statutory capital contribution that it expects to make to it insurance subsidiary over the next several year well to meet it debt maturity and other obligation ge capital expects to rely on it existing liquidity cash generated from asset reduction cash flow from it business ge repayment of intercompany loan and capital contribution from ge however ge capital excess liquidity from past disposition proceeds run off and it future earnings are reduced result of business and asset sale there is risk that future adverse development could cause liquidity or funding stress for ge capital for example it is possible that future requirement for capital contribution to the insurance subsidiary will be greater than currently estimated or could be accelerated by regulator our annual testing of insurance reserve is subject to variety of assumption including assumption about the discount rate which is sensitive to change in market interest rate morbidity mortality and future long term care premium increase any future adverse change to these assumption to the extent not offset by any favorable change to these assumption could result in an increase to future policy benefit reserve and potentially to the amount of capital we are required to contribute to the insurance subsidiary discussed in the other item insurance section within md we also anticipate that the new insurance accounting standard scheduled to be effective after discussed in the other item new accounting standard section within md will significantly change the accounting for measurement of our long duration insurance liability under gaap and will materially affect our financial statement in addition we continue to evaluate strategic option to accelerate the further reduction in the size of ge capital some of these option could have material financial charge depending on the timing negotiated term and condition of any ultimate arrangement it is also possible that contingent liability and loss estimate from ge capital continuing or discontinued operation see the other consolidated information discontinued operation section within md will need to be recognized or increase in the future and will become payable if ge capital credit rating are downgraded because of inadequate increase in it capital level over time change in rating application or methodology or other factor ge capital may also face increased interest cost and limitation on it ability to access external funding in the future ge capital also ha exposure to many different industry and counterparties including sovereign government and routinely executes transaction with counterparties in the financial service industry including broker and dealer commercial bank investment bank and other institutional client many of these transaction expose ge capital to credit risk in the event of default of it counterparty or client if condition in the financial market deteriorate they may adversely affect the business and result of operation of ge capital well the soundness of financial institution government and other counterparties we deal with there can be no assurance that future liability loss or impairment to the carrying value of financial asset would not materially and adversely affect ge capital business financial position result of operation and capacity to provide financing to support order from ge industrial business or that factor causing sufficiently severe stress at ge capital would not require ge to make larger than expected capital contribution to ge capital in the future postretirement benefit plan increase in pension and healthcare benefit obligation and cost can adversely affect our earnings cash flow and progress toward our leverage goal our result of operation may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit pension plan gaap requires that we calculate income or expense for the plan using actuarial valuation which reflect assumption about financial market interest rate and other economic condition such the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan asset we are also required to make an annual measurement of plan asset and liability which may result in significant reduction or increase to equity the factor that impact our pension calculation are subject to change in key economic indicator and future decrease in the discount rate or low return on plan asset can increase our funding obligation and adversely impact our financial result in addition although gaap expense and pension funding contribution are not directly related key economic factor that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plan under erisa failure to achieve expected return on plan asset driven by various factor which could include continued environment of low interest rate or sustained market volatility could also result in an increase to the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plan in addition there may be upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare benefit to current employee and retiree although we have actively sought to control increase in these cost there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increase and continued upward pressure could reduce our profitability for discussion regarding how our financial statement have been and can be affected by our pension and healthcare benefit obligation see the other consolidated information postretirement benefit plan and the critical accounting estimate pension assumption section within md and note to the consolidated financial statement ge form factor legal compliance risk legal and compliance risk relates to risk arising from the government and regulatory environment and action and from legal proceeding and compliance with integrity policy and procedure including those relating to financial reporting and environmental health and safety matter government and regulatory risk includes the risk that the government or regulatory action will impose additional cost on or require to make adverse change to our business model or practice regulatory we are subject to wide variety of law regulation and government policy that may change in significant way our business are subject to regulation under wide variety of federal and state and non law regulation and policy there can be no assurance that law regulation and policy will not be changed in way that will require to modify our business model and objective or affect our return on investment by restricting existing activity and product subjecting them to escalating cost or prohibiting them outright in particular recent trend globally toward increased protectionism import and export control and the use of tariff and other trade barrier can result in action by government around the world that have been and may continue to be disruptive and costly to our business and can interfere with our global operating model and weaken our competitive position other legislative and regulatory area of significance for our business that and non government have focused and continue to focus on include cybersecurity data privacy and sovereignty improper payment competition law compliance with complex economic sanction climate change and greenhouse gas emission foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility and currency control that could restrict the movement of liquidity from particular jurisdiction potential further change to tax law including additional guidance concerning the enactment of the recent tax reform may have an effect on ge ge capital or other regulated subsidiary structure operation sale liquidity capital requirement effective tax rate and performance for example legislative or regulatory measure by state or non government in response to the recent federal tax reform or otherwise or rule interpretation or audit under the new or existing tax law could increase our cost or tax rate in addition effort by public and private sector to control healthcare cost may lead to lower reimbursement and increased utilization control related to the use of our product by healthcare provider regulation or government scrutiny may impact the requirement for marketing our product and slow our ability to introduce new product resulting in an adverse impact on our business furthermore we have been and expect to continue participating in and international governmental program which require to comply with strict governmental regulation inability to comply with these regulation could adversely affect our status in these project and could have collateral consequence such debarment debarment depending on the entity involved and length of time can limit our ability to participate in other project involving multilateral development bank and adversely affect our result of operation financial position and cash flow legal proceeding we are subject to legal proceeding investigation and legal compliance risk including trailing liability from business that we dispose of or that are inactive we are subject to variety of legal proceeding legal compliance risk and environmental health and safety compliance risk in virtually every part of the world we our representative and the industry in which we operate are subject to continuing scrutiny by regulator other governmental authority and private sector entity or individual in the the european union china and other jurisdiction which have led or may in certain circumstance lead to enforcement action adverse change to our business practice fine and penalty required remedial action such contaminated site clean up or the assertion of private litigation claim and damage that could be material for example following our acquisition of alstom thermal renewables and grid business in we are subject to legacy legal proceeding and legal compliance risk that relate to claimed anti competitive conduct or improper payment by alstom in the pre acquisition period and payment for settlement judgment penalty or other liability in connection with those matter will result in cash outflow in addition since late we have been subject to range of shareholder lawsuit and inquiry from governmental authority related to the company financial performance accounting and disclosure practice and related matter we have observed that these proceeding related to claim about past financial performance and reporting pose particular reputational risk for the company that can cause new allegation about past or current misconduct even if unfounded to have more significant impact on our reputation and how we are viewed by investor customer and others than they otherwise would we have established reserve for legal matter when and appropriate however the estimation of legal reserve or possible loss involves significant judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainty and unpredictable outcome inherent in litigation and investigation and the actual loss arising from particular matter may exceed our current estimate and adversely affect our result of operation while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance program the global and diverse nature of our operation and the current enforcement environment mean that legal and compliance risk will continue to exist with respect to our operation and we are also subject to material trailing legal liability from business that we dispose of or that are inactive we also expect that additional legal proceeding and other contingency will arise from time to time moreover we sell product and service in growth market where claim arising from alleged violation of law product failure or other incident involving our product and service are adjudicated within legal system that are le developed and le reliable than those of the or other more developed market and this can create additional uncertainty about the outcome of proceeding before court or other governmental body in such market see note to the consolidated financial

financial statement although we generally do not have the intent to sell any specific debt security in the ordinary course of managing our portfolio we may sell debt security prior to their maturity for variety of reason including diversification credit quality yield and liquidity requirement and the funding of claim and obligation to policyholder we regularly review investment security for impairment for debt security if we do not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost we evaluate qualitative criterion such the financial health of and specific prospect for the issuer to determine whether we do not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the security we also evaluate quantitative criterion including determining whether there ha been an adverse change in expected future cash flow if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security we consider the security to be other than temporarily impaired otti and we record the difference between the security amortized cost basis and it recoverable amount in earnings and the difference between the security recoverable amount and fair value in other comprehensive income if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of

depreciated on straight line basis to estimated residual value over the lease term or over the estimated economic life of the equipment see note for further information lease accounting we determine if an arrangement is lease or service contract at inception where an arrangement is lease we determine if it is an operating lease or finance lease subsequently if the arrangement is modified we reevaluate our classification lessee at lease commencement we record lease liability and corresponding right of use rou asset lease liability represent the present value of our future lease payment over the expected lease term which includes option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain those option will be exercised we have elected to include lease and non lease component in determining our lease liability for all leased asset except our vehicle lease non lease component are generally service that the lessor performs for the company associated with the leased asset for those lease with payment based on an index the lease liability is determined using the index at lease commencement lease payment based on increase in the index subsequent to lease commencement are recognized variable lease expense they occur the present value of our lease liability is determined using our incremental collateralized borrowing rate at lease inception rou asset represent our right to control the use of the leased asset during the lease and are recognized in an amount equal to the lease liability over the lease term we use the effective interest rate method to account for the lease liability lease payment are made and the rou asset is amortized to earnings in manner that result in straight line expense recognition in the statement of earnings rou asset and lease liability is not recognized for lease with an initial term of month or le and we recognize lease expense for these lease on straight line basis over the lease term we test rou asset at least annually for impairment or whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the asset may be impaired lessor equipment leased to others under operating lease are included in property plant and equipment and lease classified finance lease are included in financing receivables on our statement of financial position finance lease receivables are tested for impairment described in the financing

aggregated single reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristic we recognize an impairment charge if the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds it fair value and the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill when portion of reporting unit is disposed goodwill is allocated to the gain or loss on disposition based on the relative fair value of the business or business disposed and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained ge form statementsnotes to consolidated financial statement for other intangible asset that are not deemed indefinite lived cost is generally amortized on straight line basis over the asset estimated economic life except for individually significant customer related intangible asset that are

associated company our investment in and any advance to are recorded in investment security in our consolidated statement of financial position and any subsequent change in fair value are recognized in other income within continuing operation in our consolidated statement of earnings loss see note for further information derivative and hedging we use derivative to manage variety of risk including risk related to interest rate foreign exchange and commodity price accounting for derivative hedge requires that at inception and over the term of the arrangement the hedged item and related derivative meet the requirement for hedge accounting in evaluating whether particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting we test effectiveness at inception and each reporting period thereafter by determining whether change in the fair value of the derivative offset within specified range change in the fair value of the hedged item if fair value change fail this test we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are calculated using internal valuation model incorporating market based assumption subject to third party confirmation applicable see note for further information deferred income tax deferred income tax balance reflect the effect of temporary difference between the carrying amount of asset and liability and their tax base well from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are stated at enacted tax rate expected to be in effect when those tax are paid or recovered deferred income tax asset represent amount available to reduce income tax payable on taxable income in future year we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deduction and credit by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax

meet accounting requirement to be classified held for sale and are presented single asset and liability amount in our financial statement with valuation allowance if necessary to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fair value le cost to sell financing receivables that no longer qualify to be presented held for investment are classified asset held for sale and recognized in our financial statement at the lower of cost or fair value le cost to sell with that amount representing new cost basis at the date of transfer the determination of fair value for business and asset held for sale involves significant judgment and assumption development of estimate of fair value in this circumstance is complex and is dependent upon among other factor the nature of the potential sale transaction for example asset sale versus sale of legal entity composition of asset and or business in the disposal group the comparability of the disposal group to market transaction and negotiation with third party purchaser such factor bear directly on the range of potential fair value and the selection of the best estimate key assumption were developed based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participant would use in hypothetical transaction we review all business and asset held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amount are fully recoverable in comparison to estimated fair value le cost to sell see note for further information investment contract insurance liability and insurance annuity benefit our run off insurance operation include providing insurance and reinsurance for life and health risk and providing certain annuity product primary product type include long term care structured settlement annuity life and disability insurance contract and investment contract insurance contract are contract with significant mortality and or

duration insurance contract and investment contract including annuity without significant mortality risk are not reported revenue but rather deposit liability we recognize revenue for charge and assessment on these contract mostly for mortality contract initiation administration and surrender amount credited to policyholder account are charged to expense ge form statementsnotes to consolidated financial statement liability for traditional long duration insurance contract includes both future policy benefit reserve and claim reserve future policy benefit reserve represent the present value of future policy benefit le the present value of future gross premium based on actuarial assumption liability for investment contract equal the account value that is the amount that accrues to the benefit of the contract or policyholder including credited interest and assessment through the financial statement date claim reserve are established when claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred and represents our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligation for future claim payment and claim adjustment expense to the extent that unrealized gain on specific investment security supporting our insurance contract would result in premium deficiency should those gain be realized an increase in future policy benefit reserve is recorded with an offsetting after tax reduction to net unrealized gain recorded in other comprehensive income see note for further information postretirement benefit plan we sponsor number of pension and retiree health and life insurance benefit plan that we present in three category principal pension plan other pension plan and principal retiree benefit plan we use december measurement date for these plan on our consolidated statement of financial position we measure our plan asset at fair value and the obligation at the present value of the estimated payment to plan participant participant earn benefit based on their service and pay those estimated future payment amount are determined based on assumption difference between our actual result and what we assumed are recorded in separate component of equity each period these difference are amortized into earnings over the remaining average future service of active employee or the expected life of inactive participant applicable who participate in the plan see note for further information loss contingency loss contingency are uncertain and unresolved matter that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from event or action by others that have the potential to result in future loss such contingency include but are not limited to environmental obligation litigation regulatory investigation and proceeding product quality and loss resulting from other event and development when loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss when there appears to be range of possible cost with equal likelihood liability are based on the low end of such range disclosure is provided for material loss contingency when loss is probable but reasonable estimate can not be made and when it is reasonably possible that loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of loss will exceed the recorded provision we regularly review contingency

borrowing fair value measurement the following section describe the valuation methodology we use to measure financial and non financial instrument accounted for at fair value including certain asset within our pension plan and retiree benefit plan observable input reflect market data obtained from independent source while unobservable input reflect our market assumption these input establish fair value hierarchy level quoted price for identical instrument in active market level quoted price for similar instrument in active market quoted price for identical or similar instrument in market that are not active and model derived valuation whose input are observable or whose significant value driver are observable level significant input to the valuation model are unobservable recurring fair value measurement for financial asset and liability measured at fair value on recurring basis primarily investment security and derivative fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer liability in an orderly transaction with market participant at the measurement date in the absence of active market for the identical asset or liability such measurement involve developing assumption based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participant would use in hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date see note for further information debt security when available we use quoted market price to determine the fair value of debt security which are included in level for our remaining debt security we obtain pricing information from an independent pricing vendor the input and assumption to the pricing vendor model are derived from market observable source including benchmark yield reported trade broker dealer quote issuer spread benchmark security bid offer and other market related data these investment are included in level our pricing vendor may also provide with valuation that are based on significant unobservable input and in those circumstance we classify the investment security in level annually we conduct review of our primary pricing vendor to validate that the input used in that vendor pricing process are deemed to be market observable defined in the standard we believe that the price received from our pricing vendor are representative of price that would be received to sell the asset at the measurement date exit price and are classified appropriately in the hierarchy ge form statementsnotes to consolidated financial statement we use non binding broker quote and other third party pricing service our primary basis for valuation when there is limited or no relevant market activity for specific instrument or for other instrument that share similar characteristic debt security priced in this manner are included in level equity security with readily determinable fair value these publicly traded equity security are valued using quoted price and are included in level derivative the majority of our derivative are valued using internal model the model maximize the use of market observable input including interest rate curve and both forward and spot price for currency and commodity derivative asset and liability included in level primarily represent interest rate swap cross currency swap and foreign currency and commodity forward and option contract derivative asset and liability included in level primarily represent equity derivative and interest rate product that contain embedded optionality or prepayment feature investment in private equity real estate and collective fund held within our pension plan these investment are generally valued using the net asset value nav per share practical expedient for fair

model comparative market multiple third party pricing source or combination of these approach appropriate these investment are generally included in level long lived asset fair value of long lived asset including aircraft are primarily derived internally and are based on observed sale transaction for similar asset in other instance for which we do not have comparable observed sale transaction data collateral value are developed internally and corroborated by external appraisal information adjustment to third party valuation may be performed in circumstance where market comparables are not specific to the attribute of the specific collateral or appraisal information may not be reflective of current market condition due to the passage of time and the occurrence of market event since

energy segment in the second quarter of we reorganized our grid solution reporting unit in our power segment by separating our grid solution software business from the grid solution reporting unit our grid solution software business wa moved into corporate and combined with our digital business in addition the remaining grid solution reporting unit now referred to grid solution equipment and service wa moved into our renewable energy segment separate reporting unit result we allocated goodwill between grid solution software and the grid solution equipment and service reporting unit based on the relative fair value of each business this resulted in million of goodwill transferring from our power segment to our renewable energy segment and our digital business within corporate in the

conducted step two of the goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit using current outlook in performing the second step we identified unrecognized intangible asset primarily related to internally developed technology and trade name the combination of these unrecognized intangible adjustment to the carrying value of other asset and liability and reduced reporting unit fair value calculated in step one resulted in an implied fair value of goodwill below the carrying value of goodwill for the grid solution equipment and service reporting unit therefore we recorded non cash goodwill impairment loss of million in goodwill impairment in our consolidated statement of earnings loss we determined the fair value of the grid solution equipment and service reporting unit using

reporting unit continued to experience decline in order growth and increased project cost which resulted in downward revision to our current and projected earnings and cash flow for this business therefore we performed step two analysis which resulted in non cash goodwill impairment loss of million we determined the fair value of the hydro reporting unit using the income approach we recorded

benchmark we experienced premium deficiency in our premium deficiency testing started with zero margin and accordingly any net adverse development would result in future charge to earnings using our most recent future policy benefit reserve assumption including change to our assumption related to discount rate and future premium rate increase described below we identified premium deficiency resulting in million non cash pre tax charge to earnings in the third quarter ge form statementsnotes to consolidated financial statement the increase to future policy benefit reserve resulting from our testing wa primarily attributable to the following key assumption change we have observed significant decline in market interest rate this year which ha resulted in lower discount rate and adversely impacted our reserve margin by million noted above our discount rate is based upon the actual yield on our investment portfolio and our forecasted reinvestment rate which comprise the future rate at which we expect to invest proceeds from investment maturity net of operating cash flow and projected future capital contribution market interest rate have declined by approximately basis point since our premium deficiency test with basis point of this reduction occurring since the second quarter although the movement in market rate impact the reinvestment rate it doe not materially impact the actual yield on our existing investment furthermore our assumed reinvestment rate on future fixed income investment is based both on current expected long term average rate and market interest rate thus decline in market interest rate will not result in an equivalent decline in our discount rate assumption our discount rate assumption for purpose of performing the premium deficiency assessment resulted in weighted average rate of compared to in this decline in the discount rate from to reflected lower reinvestment rate increasing to an expected long term average investment yield over longer period lower prospective expected return on higher yielding asset class introduced with our strategic initiative and slightly lower actual yield on our investment security portfolio higher level of projected long term care premium rate increase due to larger rate filing by some ceding company than previously planned which favorably impacted our reserve margin by million since our premium deficiency testing performed in we have implemented approximately million of previously approved rate increase action our premium deficiency test includes approximately million of anticipated future premium increase or benefit reduction associated with future in force rate action this represents an increase of million from our premium deficiency test to account for action that are approved and not yet implemented filed but not yet approved and estimated on future filing through and includes the effect of the lower discount rate mentioned above certain future adverse change in our assumption could result in the unlocking of reserve resetting of actuarial assumption to current assumption an increase to future policy benefit reserve and charge to earnings any favorable change to these assumption could result in additional margin in our premium deficiency test and higher income over the remaining duration of the portfolio including higher investment income claim reserve

commercial litigation investigation and other legal regulatory or governmental action including the significant matter described below that could have material impact on our result of operation in

possible loss and accrual for legal matter are not recorded until loss for particular matter is considered probable and reasonably estimable given the nature of legal matter and the complexity involved it is often difficult to predict and determine meaningful estimate of loss or range of loss until we know among other factor the particular claim involved the likelihood of success of our defense to those claim the damage or other relief sought how discovery or other procedural consideration will affect the outcome the settlement posture of other party and other factor that may have material effect on the outcome for these matter unless otherwise specified we do not believe it is possible to provide meaningful estimate of loss at this time moreover it is not uncommon for legal

include the way cooperation is assessed and valued prosecutorial discretion in the determination of damage formula for determining fine and penalty the duration and amount of legal and investigative
