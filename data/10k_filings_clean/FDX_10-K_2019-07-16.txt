national noise policy which enabled fedex express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraint fedex express international operation are also subject to noise regulation in certain of the country in which it operates concern over climate change including the impact of global warming ha led to significant and international legislative and regulatory effort to limit ghg emission including our aircraft and vehicle engine emission increasingly state and local government are also considering ghg regulatory requirement compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various country and region are following different approach to the regulation of climate change for example the eu ha established the emission trading system ets to regulate ghg emission in the eu and adopted directive in requiring each eu member state to extend the ets to aviation operation effort by the eu in to regulate flight arriving from or departing for airport outside of the eu were postponed the eu extended it stay on the extra territorial application of the eu ets applied to international flight to and from the european economic area eea through the end of calendar contingent on successful implementation of the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation corsia in the international civil aviation organization icao passed resolution adopting corsia which is global market based measure for purchasing credit to offset carbon dioxide emission and intended to aid in meeting the icao goal of carbon neutral growth starting in calendar by complementing industry effort in technology operation infrastructure and sustainable aviation fuel in june the icao adopted standard pertaining to country by country implementation including the collection and reporting of information on international aviation emission beginning in calendar in furtherance of these effort in march the faa issued notice of corsia program permitting carrier to submit emission data on voluntary basis data reported during calendar and will be used to set the calendar emission baseline and beginning in calendar carrier subject to the requirement of corsia will be responsible for purchasing and retiring carbon credit to offset emission in excess of the calendar baseline in response to the creation of the corsia program in december the eu adopted proposal which indefinitely excludes from the ets flight operating fully or partly outside the eu and gradually reduces the number of aviation allowance from calendar the eu ha indicated that it will ass corsia implementation and determine the future status of the ets applied to international aviation to and from the eea we expect compliance with corsia to increase fedex operating expense beginning in calendar the amount of such increase will ultimately depend on number of factor including the number of our flight subject to corsia the fuel efficiency of our fleet the average growth of the aviation sector our ability to utilize sustainable aviation fuel in the future and the price of icao eligible emission unit or offset required to be purchased by fedex additionally in calendar the epa issued finding that aircraft engine ghg emission cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare in march icao adopted new carbon dioxide emission standard that would apply not only to new aircraft type of calendar but also to new delivery of current in production aircraft type from calendar additionally cutoff date of calendar for production of aircraft that do not comply with proposed standard wa adopted these standard are considered to be especially stringent for larger aircraft weighing over ton the calendar epa finding is regulatory prerequisite to the adoption of the new certification standard for new aircraft emission expected in calendar or in the past the congress ha also considered bill that would regulate ghg emission and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future however in calendar the withdrew from the paris climate accord an agreement among country to reduce ghg emission and that withdrawal effect on future policy regarding ghg emission and on other ghg regulation is uncertain nevertheless the extent to which other country implement that agreement could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business we are also subject to federal state and local environmental law and regulation relating to among other thing the shipment of

control in recent year the government ha increased the number of company and person subject to export control regulation such regulation can restrict the type of item that fedex is permitted to

ha in the past considered adopting change in labor law that would make it easier for union to organize unit of our employee for example is always possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employee from the jurisdiction of the rla thereby exposing the fedex express network to sporadic labor dispute and the risk that small group of employee could disrupt the entire air ground

revenue revenue increased in due to higher volume at all of our transportation segment and increased yield at fedex ground and fedex freight at fedex ground revenue increased in due to volume growth and increased yield revenue at fedex express increased in primarily due to domestic package volume growth and international package and freight volume recovery from the notpetya cyberattack partially offset by unfavorable exchange rate fedex express revenue wa negatively impacted by an overall product mix shift from international package volume to international freight volume well softness in international priority package and freight volume resulting from weakening global economic condition fedex freight revenue increased in due to higher revenue per shipment and average daily shipment higher fuel surcharge had positive impact on revenue at all of our transportation segment in revenue increased in due to improved performance at all of our transportation segment revenue at fedex express increased in due to improved base yield and favorable exchange rate despite impact from the notpetya cyberattack at fedex ground revenue increased in due to volume growth and increased yield fedex freight revenue increased in due to higher revenue per shipment and average daily shipment higher fuel surcharge had positive impact on revenue at all of our transportation segment in business realignment cost in december we announced cost reduction program primarily through initiative at fedex service and fedex express in response to current business and economic condition that included the following based voluntary employee buyout program for eligible employee limited hiring in staff function and reduction in discretionary spending during we conducted program to offer voluntary cash buyout to eligible based employee in certain staff function the based voluntary employee buyout program includes voluntary severance payment and funding to healthcare reimbursement account with the voluntary severance payment calculated based on four week of gross base salary for every year of continuous service up to maximum payment of two year of pay this program wa completed in the fourth quarter of and approximately employee have left or will be leaving during approximately of the employee who were granted these severance agreement departed on may cost of the benefit provided under the based voluntary employee buyout program were recognized special termination benefit in the period that eligible employee accepted their offer we incurred cost of million million net of tax or per diluted share during associated with our business realignment activity these cost related primarily to severance for employee who accepted voluntary buyout in the third and fourth quarter of payment are made at the time of departure approximately million wa paid under this program during the cost of the based voluntary employee buyout program is included in the caption business realignment cost in our consolidated statement of income also included in that caption are other incremental external cost directly attributable to our business realignment activity such professional fee goodwill and other asset impairment charge in we incurred goodwill and other asset impairment charge of million related to fedex supply chain eliminating substantially all of the goodwill attributable to this reporting unit the key factor contributing to the goodwill impairment were underperformance of the fedex supply chain business during including base business erosion and the failure to attain the

matter involving fedex ground other expense also include million in and million in of charge related to certain cbp matter involving fedex logistics also included in is million of charge in connection with the settlement of and certain expected loss relating to independent contractor litigation matter involving fedex ground our operating income improved primarily due to increased revenue including recovery from the notpetya cyberattack discussed above and lower variable incentive compensation expense these benefit were partially offset by higher purchased transportation cost at fedex ground driven primarily by increased contractor settlement rate and expansion of network operation to six day per week year round in january and higher salary and employee benefit in addition decreased yield at fedex express and the impact of business realignment cost negatively affected operating margin in an overall product mix shift at fedex express from international package volume to international freight volume growth in deferred service driven by commerce well softness in international priority package and freight volume at fedex express resulting from weakening global economic condition also negatively impacted operating margin during purchased transportation cost increased in primarily due to higher volume at all of our transportation segment and increased rate including fuel cost at fedex ground and fedex freight reflecting the inflationary impact of the tight labor market on our rate salary and employee benefit expense increased in primarily due to higher staffing to support volume growth and annual merit increase partially offset by lower variable incentive compensation expense at all of our transportation segment other operating expense increased in primarily due to gain on the sale of non core business of tnt express benefiting result in and increased outside service contract at fedex express currency exchange rate had negative impact on revenue and positive impact on expense at fedex express but not have an impact on consolidated operating income in in our operating income and margin declined primarily due to the notpetya cyberattack at tnt express fourth quarter goodwill and other asset impairment charge and increased tnt express integration expense in salary and employee benefit expense increased due to merit increase at all of our transportation segment unfavorable exchange rate at fedex express and higher staffing at fedex ground and fedex freight purchased transportation cost increased in due to higher volume at all of our transportation segment increased transportation rate and higher fuel expense at fedex ground and unfavorable exchange rate at fedex express other operating expense increased in primarily due to increased outside service contract and unfavorable exchange rate at fedex express and higher tnt express integration expense fuel the following graph for our transportation segment show our average cost of jet and vehicle fuel per gallon for the year ended may fuel expense increased during due to higher fuel price however fuel price represent only one component of the factor we consider meaningful in understanding the impact of fuel on our business consideration must also be given to the fuel surcharge revenue we collect accordingly we believe discussion of the net impact of fuel on our result which is comparison of the year over year change in these two factor is important to understand the impact of fuel on our business in order to provide information about the impact of fuel surcharge on the trend in revenue and yield growth we have included the comparative weighted average fuel surcharge percentage in effect for and in the accompanying discussion of each of our transportation segment most of our fuel surcharge are adjusted on weekly basis the fuel surcharge is based on weekly fuel price from two week prior to the week in which it is assessed some fedex express international fuel surcharge incorporate timing lag of approximately six to eight week the manner in which we purchase fuel also influence the net impact of fuel on our result for example our contract for jet fuel purchase at fedex express are tied to various index including the gulf coast index while many of these index are aligned each index may fluctuate at different pace driving variability in the price paid for jet fuel furthermore under these contractual arrangement approximately of our jet fuel is purchased based on the index price for the preceding week with the remainder of our purchase tied to the index price for the preceding month rather than based on daily spot rate these contractual provision mitigate the impact of rapidly changing daily spot rate on our jet fuel purchase because of the factor described above our operating result may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by significant amount or change by amount that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharge which can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short term for more information see risk factor below we routinely review our fuel surcharge on march we updated the table used to determine our fuel surcharge for fedex express domestic service and at fedex ground on september we updated the table used to determine our fuel surcharge at fedex express and fedex ground the net impact of fuel had significant benefit to operating income in higher fuel surcharge more than offset increased fuel price the net impact of fuel on our operating result doe not consider the effect that fuel surcharge level may have on our business including change in demand and shift in the mix of service purchased by our customer in addition our purchased transportation expense may be impacted by fuel cost while fluctuation in fuel surcharge percentage can be significant from period to period fuel surcharge represent one of the many individual component of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield additional component include the mix of service sold the base price and extra service charge we obtain for these service and the level of pricing discount offered fuel expense increased during due to higher fuel price the net impact of fuel had significant benefit to operating income in higher fuel surcharge more than offset increased fuel price other income and expense interest expense increased million in primarily due to debt issuance during the year interest expense increased million in primarily due to debt and commercial paper issuance during the year retirement plan mtm adjustment we incurred pre tax noncash mtm net loss of billion in billion net of tax or per diluted share net gain of million in million net of tax or per diluted share and net gain of million in million net of tax or per diluted share from actuarial adjustment to pension and postretirement healthcare plan related to the measurement of plan asset and liability the net loss in is attributable to significantly lower discount rate change in actuarial estimate regarding rate of retirement disability and salary increase and lower than expected asset return the net gain in is attributable to an increased discount rate which more than offset loss from demographic experience the net gain for includes million loss from the purchase of group annuity contract from metropolitan life insurance company that transferred approximately of our pension plan liability the net gain in reflects higher than expected pension asset return particularly in the equity market for more information see the critical accounting estimate section of this md and note and note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement income tax

business operational change from the integration of fedex express and tnt express in local jurisdiction which impacted our determination of the realizability of the deferred tax asset in that jurisdiction and an expense of million from the impact on our deferred tax attributable to lower tax rate in the netherlands the tax rate wa favorably impacted by the tcja which resulted in benefit of million from accelerated deduction claimed on our income tax return filed in and approximately million from the lower statutory tax rate on fiscal earnings the tax rate wa favorably impacted by the tcja which resulted in provisional benefit of billion from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability benefit of approximately million related to the lower statutory income tax rate and one time benefit of million from billion contribution to our pension plan in our tax rate also included net benefit of million from corporate structuring transaction part of the ongoing integration of fedex express and tnt express and benefit of million from foreign tax credit generated by distribution to the from our foreign operation the tax rate wa negatively impacted by an increase in uncertain tax position for income tax audit our tax rate wa favorably impacted by million result of new foreign currency tax regulation the tcja enacted on december significantly changed the corporate income tax system in multiple way such reducing our statutory federal income tax rate from to due to our may fiscal year end the lower rate wa phased in resulting in statutory federal rate of for and statutory federal rate of for and subsequent year requiring to calculate one time tax on earnings which have not previously been repatriated to the transition tax and introducing new provision that took effect in including but not limited to tax on global intangible low taxed income gilti tax deduction for foreign derived intangible income additional limitation on tax deduction for executive

guidance included in these final regulation is inconsistent with our interpretation that led to the recognition of million benefit in and an additional million benefit in notwithstanding this inconsistency we remain confident in our interpretation of the tcja and intend to defend this position through litigation if necessary however if we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position we may be required to reverse the million benefit previously recorded during we completed our accounting for the tax effect of the tcja within the one year measurement period allowed under

majority of the purchase price wa allocated to property and equipment the financial result of this acquired business are included in the fedex service segment from the date of acquisition and were not material to our result of operation outlook during we expect volume growth at fedex ground and fedex express to drive higher revenue and expect improved operating income at fedex ground and fedex freight we expect operating income to decline at fedex express in due to macroeconomic weakness and trade uncertainty continued mix shift to lower yielding service and strategic decision not to renew customer contract during we will continue to implement action to reduce cost improve efficiency and adjust our network cost structure to align with forecasted volume however we will continue to execute on the strategic initiative we have in process to position to capitalize on commerce growth and other market opportunity we see for the future while fedex ground revenue is expected to grow in higher operating cost are expected to continue to negatively impact operating margin we continue to focus on investment that increase our ability to meet the demand of commerce during fedex ground expanded operation throughout the network to six day per week year round and in january fedex ground will expand residential delivery operation to seven day per week year round for the majority of the population to support these operational change fedex ground is making strategic investment to modernize and optimize it network to improve scheduling and productivity at it hub and station the integration of fedex smartpost package into standard fedex ground operation continues and the vast majority of this volume is expected to be integrated by the end of calendar which will improve last mile efficiency through increased delivery density in addition fedex ground is investing in technology and taking other strategic action to improve safety throughout it network cost associated with these fedex ground initiative are expected to be headwind in however we believe they will allow for the more efficient use of our existing asset which will drive improved performance and enhance our competitive position over the long term at fedex freight we expect to increase operational efficiency in by continuing our focus on optimizing our network fedex freight is investing in upgraded dock equipment and vehicle technology that will modernize our operation and position to realize increasing benefit in in addition safety initiative will continue to be top priority at fedex freight in our outlook for assumes we will not incur year over year expense increase in variable incentive compensation additionally our expectation for are dependent on key external factor including stable fuel price moderate economic growth no further weakening in international economic condition from our current forecast and no additional adverse development in international trade policy and relation during we will continue to execute our tnt express integration plan and are focused on completing project across our european hub and station location that will allow interoperability between network for both fedex express and tnt express package which will further lower cost the related fedex express linehaul operation are optimized in addition we will continue to focus on the operational network integration process for the key country in europe which represent significant percentage of international revenue workforce and facility integration activity in europe are complex and require consultation with work council and employee representative in number of country while we expect to make significant progress on integration activity in particularly in europe integration work will continue thereafter we expect to incur approximately million of integration expense in in the form of professional fee outside service contract salary and wage and other operating expense we expect the aggregate integration program expense including restructuring charge at tnt express to be approximately billion through and we may incur additional cost including investment that will further transform and optimize the combined business the timing and amount of integration expense and capital investment in any future period may change we revise and implement our plan our capital expenditure for are expected to be approximately billion and include fedex express investment in aircraft fleet modernization and the memphis and indianapolis hub modernization and expansion program well the investment at fedex ground and fedex freight discussed above our aircraft fleet modernization and hub modernization and expansion program at fedex express are multi year program that will entail significant investment over the next several year see the contractual cash obligation and off balance sheet arrangement section of this md for detail of our capital commitment for and beyond we will continue to evaluate our investment in critical long term strategic project to ensure our capital expenditure are expected to generate high return on investment and are balanced with our outlook for global economic condition for additional detail on key capital project refer to the financial condition capital resource and financial condition liquidity outlook section of this md we expect our effective tax rate for to be between and prior to any mtm retirement plan accounting adjustment however substantial activity and corporate structuring transaction are ongoing with respect to the integration of fedex express and tnt express we continue to integrate these business there could be material favorable and unfavorable impact to our effective tax rate during this period our outlook is dependent upon stable pricing environment for fuel volatility in fuel price impact our fuel surcharge level fuel expense and demand for our service see risk factor and forward looking statement for discussion of these and other potential risk and uncertainty that could materially affect our future performance seasonality of business our business are cyclical in nature seasonal fluctuation affect volume revenue and earnings historically the express package business experience an increase in volume in late november and december international business particularly in the asia to market peak in october and november in advance of the holiday sale season our first and third fiscal quarter because they are summer vacation and post winter holiday season have historically experienced lower volume relative to other period normally the fall is the busiest shipping period for fedex ground while late december june and july are the slowest period for fedex freight the spring and fall are the busiest period and the latter part of december through february is the slowest period shipment level operating cost and earnings for each of our company can also be adversely affected by inclement

fedex service segment provides direct and indirect support to our transportation business and we allocate all of the net operating cost of the fedex service segment including the net operating result of fedex office to reflect the full cost of operating our transportation business in the result of those segment within the fedex service segment allocation the net operating result of fedex office which are an immaterial component of our allocation are allocated to fedex express and fedex ground we review and evaluate the performance of our transportation segment based on operating income inclusive of fedex service segment allocation for the fedex service segment performance is evaluated based on the impact of it total allocated net operating cost on our transportation segment we believe these allocation approximate the net cost of providing these function our allocation methodology are refined periodically necessary to reflect change in our business effective in the result of

capital resource our operation are capital intensive characterized by significant investment in aircraft vehicle and trailer technology facility and package handling and sort equipment the amount and

billion at may cash flow from operation and available financing source will be adequate to meet our liquidity need including working capital capital expenditure requirement debt payment obligation pension contribution tnt express integration expense and the remaining payment for the based voluntary employee buyout program our cash and cash equivalent balance at may includes billion of cash in foreign jurisdiction associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy we are able to access the majority of this cash without material tax cost the enactment of the tcja significantly reduced the cost of repatriating foreign earnings from tax perspective we do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these fund impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligation our capital expenditure are expected to be approximately billion in we anticipate that our cash flow from operation will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditure in which will include spending for aircraft and hub modernization at fedex express investment that increase our efficiency in handling large package at fedex ground and investment in technology across all transportation segment that will further optimize our network and improve our competitiveness we are making investment over multiple year in our facility of approximately billion to significantly expand the fedex express indianapolis hub and approximately billion to modernize the fedex express memphis world hub we expect approximately of capital expenditure in to be designated for growth initiative our expected capital expenditure for include billion for delivery of aircraft and related equipment and progress payment toward future aircraft delivery at fedex express we have several aircraft modernization program underway that are supported by the purchase of boeing freighter and boeing freighter aircraft these aircraft are significantly more fuel efficient per unit than the aircraft type previously utilized and these expenditure are necessary to achieve significant long term operating saving and to replace older aircraft our ability to delay the timing of these aircraft related expenditure is limited without incurring significant cost to modify existing purchase agreement during fedex express entered into agreement to purchase incremental aircraft and incremental aircraft six of the and one of the aircraft purchase are conditioned upon there being no event that cause fedex express or it employee not to be covered by the railway labor act of amended rla the aircraft are expected to be

and exchange commission sec that allows to sell in one or more future offering any combination of our unsecured debt security and common stock during the fourth quarter of we replaced our billion five year revolving credit facility with billion five year credit agreement the five year credit agreement and billion day credit agreement the day credit agreement and together with the five year credit agreement the new credit agreement the five year credit agreement expires in march and includes million letter of credit sublimit the day credit agreement expires in march the new credit agreement are available to finance our operation and other cash flow need the new credit agreement contain financial covenant requiring to maintain ratio of debt to consolidated earnings excluding noncash

on rolling four quarter basis the ratio of our debt to adjusted ebitda wa to at may we believe this covenant is the only significant restrictive covenant in our new credit agreement our new credit agreement contain other customary covenant that do not individually or in the aggregate materially restrict the conduct of our business we are in compliance with the financial covenant and all other covenant in our new credit agreement and do not expect the covenant to affect our operation including our liquidity or expected funding need if we failed to comply with the financial covenant or any other covenant in our new credit agreement our access to financing could become limited we do not expect to be at risk of noncompliance with the financial covenant or any other covenant in our new credit agreement we had total of million in letter of credit outstanding at may with million of the letter of credit sublimit unused under our revolving credit facility of may no commercial paper wa outstanding for we anticipate making voluntary contribution of billion to our pension plan through available debt financing source noted in our discussion of critical accounting estimate we do not anticipate contribution to our pension plan will be required for the foreseeable future based on our funded status and the fact we have credit balance related to our cumulative excess voluntary pension contribution over those required that exceeds billion the credit balance is subtracted from plan asset to determine the minimum funding requirement therefore we could eliminate all required contribution to our principal pension plan for several year if we were to choose to waive part of that credit balance in any given year our pension plan have ample fund to meet expected benefit

liability are not included in the table below we have other long term liability reflected in our balance sheet including deferred income tax qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement healthcare plan liability and other self insurance accrual unless statutorily required the payment obligation associated with these liability are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of

the long term portion of the liability million is excluded from the table see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement for further information the amount reflected in the table above for interest on long term debt represent future interest payment due on our long term debt investing activity the amount reflected in the table above for capital purchase obligation represent

are required under certain self insurance program and are also used in the normal course of operation the underlying liability insured by these instrument are reflected in our balance sheet where applicable therefore no additional liability is reflected for the letter of credit and surety bond the amount reflected in the table above for long term debt represent future scheduled payment on our long term debt other business matter on june fedex filed suit in district court in the district of columbia seeking to enjoin the department of commerce from enforcing prohibition contained in the export administration regulation the ear against fedex fedex belief that the ear violate common carrier right to due process under the fifth amendment of the constitution they unreasonably hold common carrier strictly liable for shipment that may violate the ear without requiring evidence that the carrier had knowledge of any violation critical accounting estimate the preparation of financial statement in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state requires management to make significant judgment and estimate to develop amount reflected and disclosed in the financial statement in many case there are alternative policy or estimation technique that could be used we maintain thorough process to review the application of our accounting policy and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimate that are required to prepare the financial statement of complex global corporation however even under optimal circumstance estimate routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstance and new or better information the estimate discussed below include the financial statement element that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policy and are material to our financial statement management ha discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of director and with our independent registered public accounting firm retirement plan overview we sponsor program that provide retirement benefit to most of our employee these program include defined benefit pension plan defined contribution plan and postretirement healthcare plan and are described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement the rule for pension accounting are complex and can produce volatility in our earnings financial condition and liquidity we are required to record annual year end adjustment to our financial statement for the net funded status of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan the funded status of our plan also impact our liquidity however the cash funding rule operate under completely different set of assumption and standard than those used for financial reporting purpose result our actual cash funding requirement can differ materially from our reported funded status over the past several year we have taken numerous action to reduce pension related risk and expense including the introduction of our portable pension account benefit freezing our traditional pension benefit employing liability driven investment strategy and permitting former employee with traditional pension benefit to make one time irrevocable election to receive their benefit in lump sum distribution in may we entered into an agreement with metropolitan life insurance company to purchase group annuity contract representing the transfer of approximately billion of our pension plan obligation the transaction transferred responsibility for pension benefit to metropolitan life insurance company for approximately of our retiree and beneficiary who satisfied certain condition and were receiving monthly benefit from participating pension plan there wa no change to the pension benefit for any plan participant result of this transaction the purchase of the group annuity contract wa funded directly by asset of the pension plan the group annuity contract reduced the size of our pension plan reduced our exposure to market risk and associated balance sheet volatility and eliminated the investment administrative and pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc premium expense for approximately retiree we recognized million one time settlement loss in connection with this transaction which wa included in our year end mtm retirement plan accounting adjustment the salary and employee benefit caption of our consolidated income statement includes expense associated with service cost the other retirement plan expense income caption of our consolidated income statement includes our fourth quarter mtm adjustment expense associated with prior service and interest cost the expected return on asset eroa and settlement summary of our retirement plan cost over the past three year is follows in million defined benefit pension plan defined contribution plan postretirement healthcare plan retirement plan mark to market loss gain the component of the mtm adjustment are follows in million discount rate change demographic experience current year actuarial loss change in future assumption actual versus expected return on asset annuity contract purchase total mark to market loss gain the weighted average discount rate for all our pension and postretirement healthcare plan decreased from at may to at may the demographic experience in reflects update to several forward looking assumption including retirement rate disability incidence rate and salary increase assumption and current year actuarial loss due to unfavorable experience compared to various demographic assumption the actual rate of return which is net of all fee and expense on our pension plan asset of wa lower than our expected return of lower than expected equity return negatively impacted return seeking asset while fixed income asset performed expected due to declining interest rate the weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan increased from at may to at may the demographic experience in reflects liability loss due to unfavorable result related to various demographic assumption the annuity contract purchase loss relates to the contract with metropolitan life insurance company discussed above the actual rate of return which is net of all fee and expense on our pension plan asset of wa slightly lower than our expected return of primarily due to generally flat return in the long duration fixed income portfolio partially offset by strong return from global equity the actual rate of return on our pension plan asset which is net of all fee and expense of wa higher than our expected return of primarily due to rise in the value of global equity market in addition to favorable credit market condition the weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan decreased from at may to at may the demographic experience in reflects an update in mortality table for pension and other postemployment benefit plan discount rate the discount rate is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payment that have been accrued to date the projected benefit obligation or pbo to their net present value and to determine the succeeding year ongoing pension expense prior to any year end mtm adjustment the discount rate is determined each year at the plan measurement date the discount rate for our pension plan at each measurement date wa follows measurement date discount rate we determine the discount rate with the assistance of actuary who calculate the yield on theoretical portfolio of high grade corporate bond rated aa or better in developing this theoretical portfolio we select bond that match cash flow to benefit payment limit our concentration by industry and issuer and apply screening criterion to ensure bond with call feature have low probability of being called to the extent scheduled bond proceeds exceed the estimated benefit payment in given period the calculation assumes those excess proceeds are reinvested at one year forward rate the measurement of our pbo and the related impact on our annual mtm adjustment is highly sensitive to the discount rate assumption for our largest pension plan basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased our pbo by approximately billion and basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased our pbo by approximately billion however our annual segment level pension expense is le sensitive to change in the discount rate for example one basis point increase in the discount rate for our largest pension plan would have million effect on the fourth quarter mtm adjustment but only net impact on segment level pension expense plan asset the expected average rate of return on plan asset is long term forward looking assumption that affect our segment level pension expense it is required to be the expected future long term rate of earnings on plan asset our pension plan asset are invested primarily in publicly tradable security and our pension plan hold only minimal investment in fedex common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third party pension fund investment manager part of our strategy to manage pension cost and funded status volatility we follow liability driven investment strategy to better align plan asset with liability establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension asset is judgmental matter which we review on an annual basis and revise appropriate management considers the following factor in determining this assumption the duration of our pension plan liability which drive the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan asset the type of investment class in which we invest our pension plan asset and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment class to earn over time net of all fee and expense and the investment return we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the return we could expect if investment were made strictly in indexed fund for consolidated pension expense we assumed expected long term rate of return on our pension plan asset in and in and we increased our eroa assumption in to the decrease in the number of retiree in payment status due to the purchase of group annuity contract in may discussed above is expected to reduce our short term future cash outlay and allow the remaining asset to be placed in longer duration investment which will increase the rate of return on asset also the reduction of pbgc fixed and variable rate premium should increase the net return on asset the actuarial historical annual return on our pension plan asset calculated on compound geometric basis wa net of all fee and expense for the year period ended may for our pension plan one basis point change in our eroa would impact our pension expense by million funded status the following is information concerning the funded status of our pension plan of may on financial reporting basis in million funded status of plan projected benefit obligation pbo fair value of plan asset funded status of the plan cash amount cash contribution during the year benefit payment during the year funding the funding requirement for our pension plan are governed by the pension protection act of which ha aggressive funding requirement in order to avoid benefit payment restriction that become effective if the funded status determined under internal revenue service rule fall below at the beginning of plan year all of our pension plan have funded status level in excess of and our plan are fully funded under the employee retirement income security act additionally current benefit payment do not materially impact our total plan asset benefit payment for our pension plan for were approximately million or of plan asset benefit payment were lower in due to the annuity purchase in discussed above over the past several year we have made voluntary contribution to our pension plan in excess of the minimum required contribution for no pension contribution are required for our pension plan they are fully funded under the employee retirement income security act however we expect to make voluntary contribution of billion to these plan in see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement for further information about our retirement plan income tax we are subject to income tax in the and numerous foreign jurisdiction our income tax are function of our income statutory tax rate and tax planning opportunity available to in the various jurisdiction in which we operate further the acquisition of tnt express in expanded our foreign operation significantly and increased the complexity of our global operation from an income tax perspective the tax law in the various jurisdiction are complex and subject to different interpretation by and the respective governmental taxing authority result significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax position including evaluating uncertainty also our effective tax rate is significantly affected by the earnings generated in each jurisdiction so unexpected fluctuation in the geographic mix of earnings could significantly impact our tax rate our intercompany transaction are based on globally accepted transfer pricing principle which align profit with the business operation and function of the various legal entity in our international business we evaluate our tax position quarterly and adjust the balance new information becomes available these evaluation are based on factor including but not limited to change in fact or circumstance change in tax law or their interpretation audit activity and change in our business in addition management considers the advice of third party in making conclusion regarding tax consequence tax contingency arise from uncertainty in the application of tax rule throughout the many jurisdiction in which we operate despite our belief that our tax return position are consistent with applicable tax law taxing authority could challenge certain position we record tax benefit for uncertain tax position based upon management evaluation of the information available at the reporting date to be recognized in the financial statement tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merit the benefit for position meeting the recognition threshold is measured the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with taxing authority that ha full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required in making these determination and adjustment to unrecognized tax benefit may be necessary to reflect actual tax payable upon settlement deferred income tax asset represent amount available to reduce income tax payable on taxable income in future year such asset arise because of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability well from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deduction and credit by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategy these source of income rely heavily on estimate to make this determination so there is risk that these estimate will have to be revised new information is received to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that deferred tax asset will be recovered valuation allowance is established we believe we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefit related to the remaining net deferred tax asset in our consolidated balance sheet that are not subject to valuation allowance our income tax position are based on currently enacted tax law on december the united state government enacted comprehensive tax legislation through the tcja which significantly change the corporate income tax system and includes among other thing permanent reduction in the corporate income tax rate from to one time transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings and new tax on certain foreign source earnings and certain related party payment which are referred to the global intangible low taxed income tax and the base erosion and anti abuse tax the tcja requires complex computation to be performed that were not previously required in tax law significant judgment estimate and calculation to be made in interpreting it provision and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the treasury department the internal revenue service and other standard setting body could interpret or issue guidance on how provision of the tcja will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation in addition further legislative action could be taken to address question or issue caused by the tcja we continue our ongoing analysis of the tcja related interpretation collect and prepare necessary data and interpret any additional guidance we may be required to make adjustment to amount that we have recorded that may materially impact our result of operation and financial condition additionally state and foreign government may issue guidance and enact tax law in response to the tcja or other global initiative that could result in further change to our taxation and adversely impact our result of operation and financial condition for more information including impact from the tcja see the income tax section of this md and note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement self insurance accrual we are self insured up to certain limit for cost associated with worker compensation claim vehicle accident and general business liability and benefit paid under employee healthcare and disability program our reserve are established for estimate of loss on reported claim including incurred but not reported claim self insurance accrual reflected in our balance sheet were billion at may and billion at may approximately of these accrual were classified current liability our self insurance accrual are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claim incurred of the balance sheet date these estimate include consideration of factor such severity of claim frequency and volume of claim healthcare inflation seasonality and plan design cost trend on material accrual are updated each quarter we self insure up to certain limit that vary by type of risk periodically we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance level based on risk tolerance and premium expense where estimable loss covered by insurance are recognized on gross basis with corresponding insurance receivable we believe the use of actuarial method to account for these liability provides consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accrual however the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claim involved and the length of time the ultimate cost is known we believe our recorded obligation for these expense are consistently measured on conservative basis nevertheless change in healthcare cost accident frequency and severity insurance retention level and other factor can materially affect the estimate for these liability long lived asset useful life and salvage value our business is capital intensive with approximately of our total asset invested in our transportation and information system infrastructure the depreciation or amortization of our capital asset over their estimated useful life and the determination of any salvage value requires management to make judgment about future event because we utilize many of our capital asset over relatively long period the majority of aircraft cost are depreciated over to year we periodically evaluate whether adjustment to our estimated service life or salvage value are necessary to ensure these estimate properly match the economic use of the asset this evaluation may result in change in the estimated life and residual value used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment for our aircraft we typically assign no residual value due to the utilization of these asset in cargo configuration which result in little to no value at the end of their useful life these estimate affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in period and ultimately the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset change in the estimated life of asset will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future period and could have material impact on our result of operation described below historically gain and loss on disposal of operating equipment have not been material however such amount may differ materially in the future due to change in business level technological obsolescence accident frequency regulatory change and other factor beyond our control impairment of may the fedex express global air and ground network included fleet of aircraft including approximately supplemental aircraft that provide delivery of package and freight to more than country and territory through wide range of and international shipping service while certain aircraft are utilized in primary geographic area versus international we operate an integrated global network and utilize our aircraft and other mode of transportation to achieve the lowest cost of delivery while maintaining our service commitment to our customer because of the integrated nature of our global network our aircraft are interchangeable across route and geography giving flexibility with our fleet planning to meet changing global economic condition and maintain and modify aircraft needed because of the lengthy lead time for aircraft manufacture and modification we must anticipate volume level and plan our fleet requirement year in advance and make commitment for aircraft based on those projection furthermore the timing and availability of certain used aircraft type particularly those with better fuel efficiency may create limited opportunity to acquire these aircraft at favorable price in advance of our capacity need these activity create risk that asset capacity may exceed demand at may we had two purchased aircraft that were not yet placed into service the accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with it estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the cash flow do not exceed the carrying value the asset must be adjusted to it current fair value we operate integrated transportation network and accordingly cash flow for most of our operating asset are assessed at network level not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment further decision about capital investment are evaluated based on the impact to the overall network rather than the return on an individual asset we make decision to remove certain long lived asset from service based on projection of reduced capacity need or lower operating cost of newer aircraft type and those decision may result in an impairment charge asset held for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair value le cost to sell when the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criterion are met the fair value determination for such aircraft may require management estimate there may not be active market for some of these aircraft such estimate are subject to revision from period to period in the normal management of our aircraft fleet we routinely idle aircraft and engine temporarily due to maintenance cycle and adjustment of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand level temporarily idled asset are classified available for use and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these asset these temporarily idled asset are assessed for impairment on quarterly basis the criterion for determining whether an asset ha been permanently removed from service and result is potentially impaired include but are not limited to our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume level including capacity need during our peak shipping season the introduction of new fleet type or decision to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operation and change to planned service expansion activity at may we had seven aircraft temporarily idled these aircraft have been idled for an average of month and are expected to return to revenue service in order to meet expected demand sale on april we sold non core business of tnt express and recorded gain of million in the fedex express segment lease we utilize operating lease to finance certain of our aircraft facility and equipment such arrangement typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the asset at the end of the lease period to the lessor disclosed in financial condition contractual cash obligation and off balance sheet arrangement and note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement at may we had approximately billion on an undiscounted basis of future commitment for payment under operating lease the weighted average remaining lease term of all operating lease outstanding at may wa approximately six year the future commitment for operating lease are not yet reflected liability in our balance sheet until the new rule on lease accounting issued in become effective in described below the determination of whether lease is accounted for capital lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimate primarily about the fair value of the asset and it estimated economic useful life in addition our evaluation includes ensuring we properly account for build to suit lease arrangement and making judgment about whether various form of lessee involvement during the construction period make the lessee an agent for the owner lessor or in substance the owner of the asset during the construction period we believe we have well defined and controlled process for making these evaluation including obtaining third party appraisal for material transaction to assist in making these evaluation on february the financial accounting standard board issued new lease accounting standard based on the new lease accounting standard and our lease portfolio we anticipate recognizing lease liability and related right of use asset on the balance sheet of approximately billion with an immaterial impact on our income statement compared to the current lease accounting model these change are effective june fiscal see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement for more information on this recent accounting guidance goodwill of may we had billion of recorded goodwill from our business acquisition representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net asset acquired of may we had billion of recorded goodwill from our business acquisition representing the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net asset acquired during we recorded million in additional goodwill associated with the completion of the purchase price allocation related to the tnt express acquisition several factor give rise to goodwill in our acquisition such the expected benefit from synergy of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment in our evaluation of goodwill impairment we perform qualitative assessment that requires management judgment and the use of estimate to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount an entity ha an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test an entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period we performed both qualitative and quantitative assessment of goodwill of may this included comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying value including attributable goodwill fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodology principally the income or market approach incorporating market participant consideration and management assumption on revenue growth rate operating margin discount rate and expected capital expenditure estimate used by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test change in forecasted operating result and other assumption could materially affect these estimate we perform our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter unless circumstance indicate the need to accelerate the timing of the test since the beginning of the financial reporting of tnt express ha been fully integrated into the fedex express segment and separate reporting unit doe not exist for this entity while there are several factor negatively impacting near term result at fedex express including softening global economic condition product mix shift to lower yielding service due in part to an increase in commerce traffic and the timing and amount of tnt express integration program expense fedex express continues to be an established profitable business with fair value that significantly exceeds it carrying value based on our valuation performed during the fourth quarter of in addition our other reporting unit with significant recorded goodwill include fedex ground fedex freight and fedex office reported in the fedex service segment we evaluated these reporting unit during the fourth quarter of and the estimated fair value of each of these reporting unit exceeded their carrying value of the end of and therefore we do not believe that any of these reporting unit were impaired of the balance sheet date in connection with our annual impairment testing of goodwill conducted in the fourth quarter of we recorded an impairment charge of million for substantially all of the goodwill attributable to our fedex supply chain reporting unit the key factor contributing to the goodwill impairment were underperformance of the fedex supply chain business during including base business erosion and the failure to attain the level of operating synergy and revenue and profit growth anticipated at the time of acquisition based on these factor our outlook for the business and industry changed in the fourth quarter of legal and other contingency we are subject to various loss contingency in connection with our operation contingent liability are difficult to measure their measurement is subject to multiple factor that are not easily predicted or projected further additional complexity in measuring these liability arises due to the various jurisdiction in which these matter occur which make our ability to predict their outcome highly uncertain moreover different accounting rule must be employed to account for these item based on the nature of the contingency accordingly significant management judgment is required to ass these matter and to make determination about the measurement of liability if any certain pending loss contingency are described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement in the opinion of management the aggregate liability if any of individual matter or group of related matter not specifically described in note is not expected to be material to our financial position result of operation or cash flow the following describes our method and associated process for evaluating these matter because of the complex environment in which we operate we are subject to other legal proceeding and claim including those relating to general commercial matter governmental enforcement action employment related claim and fedex ground owner operator accounting guidance for contingency requires an accrual of estimated loss from contingency such non income tax or other legal proceeding or claim when it is probable the future event or event are likely to occur that loss ha been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated this guidance also requires disclosure of loss contingency matter when in management judgment material loss is reasonably possible or probable during the preparation of our financial statement we evaluate our contingency to determine whether it is probable reasonably possible or remote that liability ha been incurred loss is recognized for all contingency deemed probable and estimable regardless of amount for unresolved contingency with potentially material exposure that are deemed reasonably possible we evaluate whether potential loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated our evaluation of these matter is the result of comprehensive process designed to ensure that accounting recognition of loss or disclosure of these contingency is made in timely manner and involves our legal and accounting personnel well external counsel where applicable the process includes regular communication during each quarter and scheduled meeting shortly before the completion of our financial statement to evaluate any new legal proceeding and the status of existing matter in determining whether loss should be accrued or loss contingency disclosed we evaluate among other factor the current status of each matter within the scope and context of the entire lawsuit or proceeding the lengthy and complex nature of class action matter the procedural status of each matter any opportunity to dispose of lawsuit on it merit before trial motion to dismiss or for summary judgment the amount of time remaining before trial date the status of discovery the status of settlement arbitration or mediation proceeding and our judgment regarding the likelihood of success prior to or at trial in reaching our conclusion with respect to accrual of loss or loss contingency disclosure we take holistic view of each matter based on these factor and the information available prior to the issuance of our financial statement uncertainty with respect to an individual factor or combination of these factor may impact our decision related to accrual or disclosure of loss contingency including conclusion that we are unable to establish an estimate of possible loss or meaningful range of possible loss we update our disclosure to reflect our most current understanding of the contingency at the time we issue our financial statement however event may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of contingency may result in loss to that differs materially from our previously estimated liability or range of possible loss despite the inherent complexity in the accounting and disclosure of contingency we believe that our process are robust and thorough and provide consistent framework for management in evaluating the potential outcome of contingency for proper accounting recognition and disclosure risk factor wide range of factor could materially adversely affect our business result of operation financial condition and the price of our common stock the most significant of these factor include the following we are directly affected by the state of the economy and anti trade measure while macroeconomic risk apply to most company we are particularly vulnerable the transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trend in economic activity our primary business is to transport good so our business level are directly tied to the purchase and production of good key macroeconomic measurement when individual and company purchase and produce fewer good we transport fewer good and company expand the number of distribution center and move manufacturing closer to consumer market we transport good shorter distance in addition we have relatively high fixed cost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume level moreover we continue to grow our international business we are increasingly affected by the health of the global economy the rate of growth of global trade world trade policy international tax government to government relation and the typically more volatile economy of emerging market for instance anti trade and protectionist measure adopted by the or other country in which we do business such trade control tariff quota embargo sanction or retaliation by another country against such measure could result in economic uncertainty and instability resulting in fewer good being transported globally in we saw customer preference for slower le costly shipping service additionally during weakness in the global economy adversely affected our result of operation and we expect such weakness to continue to be present during significant data breach or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could disrupt our operation and result in the loss of critical confidential information adversely impacting our reputation business or result of operation our ability to attract and retain customer to efficiently operate our business and to compete effectively depends in part upon the sophistication and reliability of our technology network including our ability to provide feature of service that are important to our customer to protect our confidential business information and the information provided by our customer and to maintain customer confidence in our ability to protect our system and to provide service consistent with their expectation for example we rely on information technology to receive package level information in advance of physical receipt of package to track item that move through our delivery system to efficiently plan delivery to execute billing process and to track and report financial and operational data we are subject to risk imposed by data breach and operational disruption including through cyberattack or cyber intrusion including by computer hacker foreign government cyber terrorist cyber criminal and malicious employee or other insider data breach of company and government have increased in recent year the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attack and intrusion from around the world have increased and we our customer and third party increasingly store and transmit data by mean of connected information technology system additionally risk such code anomaly act of god transitional challenge in migrating operating company functionality to our fedex enterprise automation platform data leakage and human error pose direct threat to our product service and data and could result in unauthorized or block legitimate access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operation customer employee and supplier including personal information the technology infrastructure of acquired business well their practice related to the use and maintenance of data could also present issue that we were not able to identify prior to the acquisition we also depend on and interact with the technology and system of third party including our customer and third party service provider such cloud service provider and delivery service such third party may have access to information we maintain about our company customer employee and vendor or operate system that are critical to our business operation and service like these third party are subject to risk imposed by data breach cyberattacks and other event or action that could damage disrupt or close down their network or system we have security process protocol and standard in place including contractual provision requiring such security measure that are applicable to such third party and are designed to protect information that is held by them or to which they have access result of their engagement with nevertheless cyberattack could defeat one or more of such third party security measure allowing an attacker to obtain information about our company customer employee and vendor or disrupt our operation these third party may also experience operational disruption or human error that could result in unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operation customer employee and supplier including personal information disruption to our complex global technology infrastructure including those impacting our computer system and website could result in the loss of confidential business or customer information require substantial repair or replacement resulting in significant cost and lead to the temporary or permanent transfer by customer of some or all of their business to our competitor the foregoing could harm our reputation and adversely impact our operation customer service and result of operation additionally security breach could require to devote significant management resource to address the problem created these type of adverse impact could also occur in the event the confidentiality integrity or availability of company and customer information wa compromised due to data loss by fedex or trusted third party we or the third party with which we share information may not discover any security breach and loss of information for significant period of time after the security breach occurs recently there ha also been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the at both the state and federal level and abroad and an actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable or foreign data protection regulation or other data protection standard may expose to litigation including in some instance class action litigation fine sanction or other penalty which could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business result of operation and financial condition this regulatory environment is increasingly challenging and may present material obligation and risk to our business including significantly expanded compliance burden cost and enforcement risk for example the european union eu general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective in may greatly increase the jurisdictional reach of eu law and add broad array of requirement related to personal data including individual notice and opt out preference and the public disclosure of significant data breach additionally violation of the gdpr can result in fine of much of company annual revenue other government have enacted or are enacting similar data protection law including data localization law that require data to stay within their border all of these evolving compliance and operational requirement well the uncertain interpretation and enforcement of law impose significant cost and regulatory risk that are likely to increase over time we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiative information technology risk management and disaster recovery plan including investment to retire and replace end of life system the development and maintenance of these measure is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating technology change and effort to overcome security measure become increasingly more intense and sophisticated despite our effort we are not fully insulated from data breach technology disruption or data loss which could adversely impact our competitiveness and result of operation for instance in june tnt express worldwide operation were significantly affected due to the infiltration of an information technology virus known notpetya in may fedex wa one of many company attacked by the rapidly spreading ransomware described wannacry that exploited vulnerability in third party software program and infected computer using that program encrypting file and holding them for ransom additionally during the third quarter of we discovered an unsecured server hosted by one of our third party cloud service provider which exposed some archived account information related to service discontinued after our acquisition of bongo international llc the server ha been secured and we have found no indication that any information ha been misappropriated in connection with the incident neither the wannacry ransomware attack or unsecured server caused material disruption to our system or resulted in any material cost to fedex while we have significant security process and initiative in place we may be unable to detect or prevent breach or disruption in the future additionally while we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspect of cyber risk in place such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all loss or all type of claim that may arise additional change in international trade policy and relation could significantly reduce the volume of good transported globally and adversely affect our business and result of operation the government ha made significant change in trade policy and ha taken certain action that have negatively impacted trade including imposing tariff on certain good imported into the united state to date several government including the eu china and india have imposed tariff on certain good imported from the united state these action contributed to weakness in the global economy that adversely affected our result of operation during and we expect such weakness to continue to be present during any further change in or international trade policy could trigger additional retaliatory action by affected country resulting in trade war and further increased cost for good transported globally which may reduce customer demand for these product if the party to pay those tariff increase their price or in trading partner limiting their trade with country that impose anti trade measure political uncertainty surrounding international trade and other dispute could also have negative effect on consumer confidence and spending such condition could have an adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition well on the price of our common stock additionally the government ha recently taken action to limit the ability of domestic company to engage in commerce with certain foreign entity under certain circumstance given the nature of our business and our global recognizability foreign government may target fedex by limiting the ability of foreign entity to do business with in certain instance imposing monetary or other penalty or taking other retaliatory action which could have an adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition well on the price of our common stock the failure to successfully integrate the business and operation of fedex express and tnt express in the expected time frame and at the expected cost may adversely affect our future result prior to fedex acquisition of tnt express in fedex express and tnt express operated independent company there can be no assurance that these business can be integrated successfully expected integration cost have increased significantly since the acquisition wa completed and part of the integration have taken longer than initially expected it is possible that the integration process could result in higher than currently expected integration cost the loss of customer the disruption of ongoing business unexpected integration issue or the loss of key historical fedex express or tnt express employee it is also possible that the overall integration process will take longer than currently anticipated specifically the following issue among others must be addressed we integrate the operation of fedex express and tnt express in order to realize the anticipated benefit of the transaction combining the company operation and corporate function combining the business of fedex express and tnt express and meeting the capital requirement of the combination in manner that permit to achieve the operating and financial result we anticipated from the acquisition the failure of which could result in the anticipated benefit of the transaction not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all integrating and consolidating the company administrative and information technology infrastructure and computer system and modernizing certain tnt express system which suffered from underinvestment prior to the acquisition integrating and restructuring the corporate entity integrating workforce and consulting with work council and employee representative while continuing to provide consistent high quality service to customer integrating and unifying the offering and service available to historical fedex express and tnt express customer harmonizing the company operating practice employee development and compensation program integrity and compliance program term and condition of contract of carriage internal control and other policy procedure and process integrating the company financial reporting and internal control system maintaining existing agreement with customer and service provider and avoiding delay in entering into new agreement with prospective customer and service provider addressing possible difference in business background corporate culture and management philosophy addressing employee social issue so to maintain efficient and effective labor and employee relation coordinating rebranding and marketing effort managing the movement of certain position to different location managing potential unknown and unidentified liability including liability that are significantly larger than currently anticipated and unforeseen increased expense or delay associated with the integration process and managing the expanded operation of significantly larger more complex company all of these factor could dilute fedex earnings per share delay or decrease the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and negatively impact the price of our common stock the expected financial benefit of the acquisition may also be delayed or decreased by reduction in our base business level due to economic weakness in europe or other factor in addition at time the attention of certain member of our management may be focused on the integration of the business of fedex express and tnt express and diverted from day to day business operation which may disrupt our business further we may not achieve the expected financial benefit from any cost incurred in addition to our integration program expense related to investment to further transform and optimize the combined business failure to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to change in market dynamic will cause our future financial result to suffer we are making significant investment and other decision in connection with our long term business strategy which includes our ability to meet the demand of commerce such aircraft fleet modernization and hub modernization and expansion at fedex express and expansion of fedex ground residential delivery operation to seven day per week year round for the majority of the population we are also implementing various cost containment action including limited hiring and discretionary spending and based voluntary employee buyout program such initiative and enhancement may require to make significant capital expenditure additionally in developing our business strategy we make certain assumption including but not limited to those related to customer demand and the mix of service to be purchased by our customer competition and the global economy and actual market economic and other condition may be different from our assumption technology customer behavior and market condition continue to evolve it is important that we maintain the relevance of our brand and service offering to our customer if we are not able to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to change in market dynamic our future financial result will suffer the united kingdom vote to leave the eu could adversely impact our business result of operation and financial condition there is substantial uncertainty surrounding the united kingdom vote to leave the eu brexit which is scheduled for october the suspension or further delay of brexit beyond october requires the unanimous agreement of all remaining eu member state any impact of brexit depends on the term of the united kingdom withdrawal from the eu if it ultimately occurs the ongoing uncertainty within the united kingdom government and parliament on the status of withdrawal agreement could lead to economic stagnation until an ultimate resolution with respect to brexit occurs such uncertainty also sustains the possibility of hard brexit in which the united kingdom leaf the eu without withdrawal agreement and associated transition period in place the outcome of recent european parliament election and potentially the outcome of the july election to determine the next prime minister of the united kingdom could increase the likelihood of hard brexit hard brexit would likely cause significant market and economic disruption and negatively impact customer experience and service quality and could depress the demand for our service even if an agreement setting forth the term of the united kingdom withdrawal from the eu is approved the withdrawal could result in global economic downturn the united kingdom also could lose access to the single eu market and to the global trade deal negotiated by the eu on behalf of it member depressing trade between the united kingdom and other country which would negatively impact our international operation additionally we may face new regulation regarding trade aviation security and employee among others in the united kingdom compliance with such regulation could be costly negatively impacting our business result of operation and financial condition brexit could also adversely affect european and worldwide economic and market condition and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange market including volatility in the value of the euro and the british pound our business depend on our strong reputation and the value of the fedex brand the fedex brand name symbolizes high quality service reliability and speed fedex is one of the most widely recognized trusted and respected brand in the world and the fedex brand is one of our most important and valuable asset in addition we have strong reputation among customer and the general public for high standard of social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance and ethic the fedex brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sale and marketing tool and we devote significant resource to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activity by our employee contractor agent or others with we do business such customer service mishap accident catastrophe or incident involving aircraft or vehicle operated by data breach or technology infrastructure disruption noncompliance with law or the shipment of certain item pursuant to our obligation common carrier operating under federal law could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand with the increase in the use of social medium outlet such facebook youtube instagram and twitter adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly making it increasingly difficult for to effectively respond damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our service and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and result of operation well require additional resource to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand our transportation business are impacted by the price and availability of jet and vehicle fuel we must purchase large quantity of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicle and the price and availability of fuel is beyond our control and can be highly volatile in addition our purchased transportation expense may be impacted by fuel cost to date we have been mostly successful in mitigating over time the expense impact of higher fuel cost through our indexed fuel surcharge the amount of the surcharge is closely linked to the market price for fuel if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharge because of competitive pricing pressure or some other reason fuel cost could adversely impact our operating result of may we had no derivative financial instrument to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuation and we currently have no plan to use derivative financial instrument for this purpose in the future even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharge high fuel surcharge could move our customer away from our higher yielding express service to our lower yielding deferred or ground service or even reduce customer demand for our service altogether in addition disruption in the supply of fuel could have negative impact on our ability to operate our transportation network weather related event natural disaster political disruption or war involving oil producing country economic sanction imposed against oil producing country or specific industry participant change in governmental policy concerning fuel production transportation tax or marketing change in refining capacity environmental concern and other unpredictable event may impact fuel supply and could result in shortage in the future our business are capital intensive and we must make capital decision based upon projected volume level we make significant investment in aircraft package handling facility vehicle technology sort equipment copy equipment and other asset to support our transportation and business network we also make significant investment to rebrand integrate and grow the company that we acquire the amount and timing of capital investment depend on various factor including our anticipated volume growth we must make commitment to purchase or modify aircraft year before the aircraft are actually needed we must predict volume level and fleet requirement and make commitment for aircraft based on those projection missing our projection could result in much or too little capacity relative to our shipping volume overcapacity could lead to below market asset disposition or write down well negatively impact operating margin and undercapacity could negatively impact service level we face intense competition the transportation and business service market are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service especially in period of little or no macroeconomic growth some of our competitor have more financial resource and competitive advantage than we do or they are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign government which enables them to raise capital more easily we also compete with regional transportation provider that operate smaller and le capital intensive transportation network and startup company that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market need in addition some high volume package shipper are developing and implementing in house delivery capability and utilizing independent contractor for delivery which could in turn reduce our revenue and market share for example amazon com is investing significant capital to establish network of hub aircraft and vehicle we believe we compete effectively with these company for example by providing more reliable service at compensatory price however the existence of an irrational pricing environment could limit our ability not only to maintain or increase our price including our fuel surcharge in response to rising fuel cost but also to maintain or grow our revenue and market share while we believe we compete effectively through our current and planned service offering if our current competitor or potential future competitor offer broader range of service more effectively bundle their service or offer service at lower price it could impede our ability to maintain or grow our market share moreover if customer such amazon com further develop or expand internal capability for the service we provide it will reduce our revenue and could negatively impact our financial condition and result of operation news regarding such development or expansion could also negatively impact the price of our common stock additionally advancement in technology such advanced safety system automated package sorting handling and delivery vehicle platooning alternative fuel vehicle and digitization of freight service may necessitate that we increase investment in order to remain competitive and our customer may not be willing to accept higher rate to cover the cost of these investment government regulation and enforcement are evolving and unfavorable change could harm our business we are subject to regulation under wide variety of federal and state and non regulation law and policy there can be no assurance that such regulation law and policy will not be changed in way that will decrease the demand for our service subject to escalating cost or require to modify our business model and objective harming our financial result in particular legislative regulatory or other action that and non government have undertaken or are considering in area such data privacy and sovereignty tax foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility currency control that could restrict the movement of liquidity from particular jurisdiction trade control tariff quota embargo or sanction in the or other country complex economic sanction export control additional security requirement additional requirement on employee and benefit environmental standard tax reform and accounting may have an adverse effect on our operation liquidity capital requirement effective tax rate and performance for additional discussion see part item of this annual report on form under the caption regulation we could be subject to adverse change in regulation and interpretation or challenge to our tax position relating to the tcja we are subject to taxation in the and numerous foreign jurisdiction from time to time change in tax law or regulation may be enacted that could significantly affect our overall tax liability in december the united state government enacted comprehensive tax legislation through the tcja which significantly changed the corporate income tax system the tcja requires complex computation to be performed that were not previously required in tax law significant judgment estimate and calculation to be made in interpreting it provision and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the treasury department the internal revenue service and other standard setting body could interpret or issue guidance on how provision of the tcja will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation we continue our ongoing analysis of the tcja related interpretation collect and prepare necessary data and interpret any additional guidance we may be required to make adjustment to amount that we have recorded that may adversely impact our result of operation and financial condition for example on january the treasury department issued final regulation covering the one time transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings which wa enacted part of the tcja certain guidance included in these final regulation is inconsistent with our interpretation that led to the recognition of benefit of million if we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position with respect to our interpretation of the tcja we may be required to reverse these benefit in addition further legislative action could be taken to address question or issue caused by the tcja state and foreign government may also issue guidance and enact tax law in response to the tcja or other global initiative that could result in further change to our taxation and adversely impact our result of operation and financial condition if we do not successfully execute or effectively operate integrate leverage and grow acquired business our financial result and reputation may suffer our strategy for long term growth productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to make prudent strategic acquisition and to realize the benefit we expect when we make those acquisition in furtherance of this strategy in addition to tnt express we have acquired business in europe latin america africa the asia and australia over the past several year acquisition involve special accounting regulatory compliance information technology human resource and other risk while we expect our past and future acquisition to enhance our value proposition to customer and improve our long term profitability there can be no assurance that we will realize our expectation within the time frame we have established if at all or that we can continue to support the value we allocate to these acquired business including their goodwill or other intangible asset for example in we incurred goodwill impairment charge of million related to fedex supply chain eliminating substantially all of the goodwill attributable to this reporting unit the key factor contributing to the goodwill impairment were underperformance of the fedex supply chain business during including base business erosion and the failure to attain the level of operating synergy and revenue and profit growth anticipated at the time of the acquisition labor organization attempt to organize group of our employee from time to time and potential change in labor law could make it easier for them to do so if we are unable to continue to maintain good relationship with our employee and avoid having labor organization organize group of our employee our operating cost could significantly increase and our operational flexibility could be significantly reduced despite continual organizing attempt by labor union other than the pilot at fedex express and driver at one fedex freight inc facility our employee have thus far chosen not to unionize we acquired fedex supply chain in which already had small number of employee who are member of union additionally certain of fedex express non employee are unionized and union ha been certified to represent owner driver at fedex freight canada corp facility the congress ha in the past considered adopting change in labor law however that would make it easier for union to organize unit of our employee for example there is always possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employee from the jurisdiction of the rla for additional discussion of the rla see part item of this annual report on form under the caption regulation such legislation could expose our customer to the type of service disruption that the rla wa designed to prevent local work stoppage in key area that interrupt the timely flow of shipment of time sensitive high value good throughout our global network such disruption could threaten our ability to provide competitively priced shipping option and ready access to global market there is also the possibility that congress could pas other labor legislation that could adversely affect our company such fedex ground and fedex freight whose employee are governed by the national labor relation act of amended nlra in addition federal and state governmental agency such the national mediation board and the national labor relation board have and may continue to take action that could make it easier for our employee to organize under the rla or nlra finally change to federal or state law governing employee classification could impact the status of fedex ground owner operator independent employer of driver if fedex ground is deemed to be an employer or joint employer of the driver of these independent contractor labor organization could more easily organize these individual our operating cost could increase materially and we could incur significant capital outlay fedex ground relies on owner operator to conduct it linehaul and pickup and delivery operation and the status of these owner operator independent contractor and direct employer of driver providing these service is being challenged fedex ground use of independent contractor is well suited to the need of the ground delivery business and it customer evidenced by the strong growth of this business segment we are involved in lawsuit and administrative proceeding that claim the company owner operator engaged under operating agreement no longer in place should have been treated our employee rather than independent contractor in addition we are defending joint employer case where it is alleged that fedex ground should be treated an employer of the driver employed by owner operator engaged by fedex ground we incur certain cost including legal fee in defending the status of fedex ground owner operator independent contractor and direct employer of their driver we continue to believe that owner operator engaged by fedex ground are properly classified independent contractor and that fedex ground is not an employer or joint employer of the driver of these independent contractor however adverse determination in these matter could among other thing entitle certain of our owner operator to the reimbursement of certain expense and their driver to certain wage payment from the owner operator and fedex ground and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for fedex ground change to state law governing the definition of independent contractor or employee of independent contractor could also impact the status of fedex ground owner operator disruption or modification in service by the usps or change in it business or financial soundness could have an adverse effect on our operation and financial result the postal service usps is significant customer and vendor of fedex in particular the usps is the largest customer of fedex express which provides domestic air transportation service for the usps first class mail priority mail express and priority mail and transportation and delivery for the usps international delivery service disruption or modification in service by the usps result of financial difficulty or change in it business including any structural change to it operation network service offering or pricing could adversely affect our operation negatively impacting our revenue result of operation and financial condition the transportation infrastructure continues to be target of terrorist activity because transportation asset continue to be target of terrorist activity government around the world are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirement that will increase operating cost and potentially slow service for business including those in the transportation industry for example the transportation security administration tsa requires fedex express to comply with full all cargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains evolving and strict security requirement additionally the international civil aviation organization currently allows member state to permit carrier and other entity to determine without government oversight which shipper and shipment are secure for purpose of putting those shipment on all cargo aircraft this allowance will be removed by calendar and may require to undergo additional screening and oversight by the tsa and similar government agency internationally security requirement such these are not static but change periodically the result of regulatory and legislative requirement imposing additional security cost and creating level of uncertainty for our operation thus it is reasonably possible that these rule or other future security requirement could impose material cost on or slow our service to our customer the impact on our operation of avoiding area of the world including airspace in which there are geopolitical conflict and the targeting of aircraft by party to those conflict can also be significant moreover terrorist attack directed at fedex or other aspect of the transportation infrastructure could disrupt our operation and adversely impact demand for our service the regulatory environment for global aviation or other transportation right may impact our operation and increase our operating cost our extensive air network is critical to our success our right to serve foreign point is subject to the approval of the department of transportation and generally requires bilateral agreement between the and foreign government in addition we must obtain the permission of foreign government to provide specific flight and service our operation outside of the such fedex express growing international domestic operation are also subject to current and potential regulation including certain postal regulation and licensing requirement that restrict make difficult and sometimes prohibit the ability of foreign owned company such fedex express to compete effectively in part of the international domestic transportation and logistics market regulatory or executive action affecting global aviation or transportation right or failure to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation right in important international market could impair our ability to operate our network we are subject to other extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirement that may result in significant cost for instance the federal aviation administration faa from time to time issue directive and other regulation relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditure in order to comply high profile accident catastrophe or incident involving aircraft may trigger increased regulatory and legal compliance requirement these requirement can be issued with little or no notice or can otherwise impact our ability to efficiently or fully utilize our aircraft and in some instance have resulted in the temporary grounding of aircraft type altogether further our business may be adversely impacted when government agency cease to operate expected including due to partial shutdown sequestration or similar event which may result in among other thing disruption in the ability of government agency to grant required regulatory approval for additional discussion see part item of this annual report on form under the caption regulation we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market response to such change concern over climate change including the impact of global warming ha led to significant and international legislative and regulatory effort to limit greenhouse gas ghg emission including our aircraft and vehicle engine emission increasingly state and local government are also considering ghg regulatory requirement compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various country and region are following different approach to the regulation of climate change increased regulation regarding ghg emission especially aircraft or vehicle engine emission could impose substantial cost on especially at fedex express these cost include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital cost associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicle prematurely until the timing scope and extent of such possible regulation becomes known we can not predict it effect on our cost structure or our operating result it is reasonably possible however that it could materially increase our operating expense and have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business if instituted for additional discussion of regulatory response to climate change including the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation and the paris climate accord see part item of this annual report on form under the caption regulation moreover even without such regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by company in the airline and transportation industry could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our service especially our air express service finally given the broad and global scope of our operation and our susceptibility to global macroeconomic trend we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risk of climate change that could affect all of humankind such shift in weather pattern and world ecosystem our failure to attract or retain employee talent or maintain our company culture could adversely impact our business our success depends upon the effort and ability of our high quality employee many of whom are longstanding fedex team member difficulty in recruiting motivating rewarding and retaining employee talent including successor to member of senior management or the unexpected loss of such individual resulting in the depletion of our institutional knowledge base could have an adverse impact on our business result of operation reputation and the price of our common stock additionally our company culture is important to providing high quality customer service and having productive workforce and could be adversely affected by our growing operation and other factor if we fail to maintain the strength of our company culture our competitive

the account of fedex and it subsidiary substantially all of which are wholly owned all significant intercompany account and transaction have been eliminated in consolidation we are not the primary beneficiary of nor do we have controlling financial interest in any variable interest entity accordingly we have not consolidated any variable interest entity revenue recognition satisfaction of performance obligation performance obligation is promise in contract to transfer distinct good or service to the customer and is the basis of revenue recognition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle gaap to determine the proper revenue recognition method for contract we evaluate whether two or more contract should be combined and accounted for one single contract and whether the combined or single contract should be accounted for more than one performance obligation for most of our contract the customer contract with to provide distinct service within single contract such transportation service the majority of our contract with customer for transportation service include only one performance obligation the transportation service themselves however if contract is separated into more than one performance obligation we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling price of the promised good or service underlying each performance obligation we frequently sell standard transportation service with observable standalone sale price in these instance the observable standalone sale are used to determine the standalone selling price for transportation service revenue is recognized over time we perform the service in the contract because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer our customer receive the benefit of our service the good are transported from one location to another if we were unable to complete delivery to the final location another entity would not need to reperform the transportation service already performed control transfer over time revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the product or service to be provided we use the cost to cost measure of progress for our package delivery contract because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs we incur cost on our contract under the cost to cost measure of progress the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of cost incurred to date to the total estimated cost at completion of the performance obligation revenue including ancillary or accessorial fee and reduction for estimated customer incentive are recorded proportionally cost are incurred cost to fulfill include labor and other direct cost and an allocation of indirect cost for our freight and freight forwarding contract an output method of progress based on time in transit is utilized the timing of cost incurred doe not best depict the transfer of control to the customer fedex corporation note to consolidated financial statement we also provide customized customer specific solution such supply chain management solution and inventory and service part logistics through which we provide the service of integrating complex set of task and component into single capability for these arrangement the majority of which are conducted by our fedex logistics inc fedex logistics formerly fedex trade network inc operating segment the entire contract is accounted for one performance obligation for these performance obligation we typically have right to consideration from customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance completed to date and such we recognize revenue in the amount to which we have right to invoice the customer contract modification contract are often modified to account for change in the rate we charge our customer or to add additional distinct service we consider contract modification to exist when the modification either creates new enforceable right and obligation or alters the existing arrangement contract modification that add distinct good or service are treated separate performance obligation contract modification that do not add distinct good or service typically change the price of existing service these contract modification are accounted for prospectively the remaining performance obligation are executed variable consideration certain contract contain customer incentive guaranteed service refund and other provision that can either increase or decrease the transaction price these incentive are generally awarded based upon achieving certain performance metric we estimate variable consideration the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled we include estimated amount of revenue which may be reduced by incentive or other contract provision in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved our estimate of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amount in the transaction price are based on an assessment of anticipated customer spending and all information historical current and forecasted that is reasonably available to principal agent consideration transportation service are provided with the use of employee and independent business that contract with fedex gaap requires to evaluate whether our business themselves promise to transfer service to the customer the principal or to arrange for service to be provided by another party the agent using control model based on our evaluation of the control model we determined that fedex is the principal to the transaction for most of these service and revenue is recognized on gross basis based on the transfer of control to the customer cost associated with independent business providing transportation service are recognized incurred and included in the caption purchased transportation in the consolidated statement of income our contract logistics global trade service and certain transportation business engage in certain transaction wherein they act agent revenue from these transaction is recorded on net basis net revenue includes billing to customer le third party charge including transportation or handling cost fee commission and tax and duty contract asset and liability contract asset include billed and unbilled amount resulting from in transit package we have an unconditional right to payment only all performance obligation have been completed package have been delivered contract asset are generally classified current and the full balance is converted each quarter based on the short term nature of the transaction our contract liability consist of advance payment and billing in excess of revenue the full balance of deferred revenue is converted each quarter based on the short term nature of the transaction gross contract asset related to in transit package totaled million and million at may and may respectively contract asset net of deferred unearned revenue were million and million at may

million at may and may respectively contract liability are included within current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet payment term certain of our revenue producing transaction are subject to tax such sale tax assessed by governmental authority we present these revenue net of tax under the typical payment term of our customer contract the customer pay at periodic interval every day day day etc for shipment included on invoice received it is not customary business practice to extend payment term past day and such we do not have practice of including significant financing component within our revenue contract with customer fedex corporation note to consolidated financial statement disaggregation of revenue see note for disclosure of disaggregated revenue for the period ended may this presentation is consistent with how we organize our segment internally for making operating decision and measuring performance credit risk we routinely grant credit to many of our customer for transportation and business service without collateral the risk of credit loss in our trade receivables is substantially mitigated by our credit evaluation process short collection term and sale to large number of customer well the low revenue per transaction for most of our service allowance for potential credit loss are determined based on historical experience and the impact of current economic condition historically credit loss have been within management expectation advertising advertising and promotion cost are expensed incurred and are classified in other operating

service these allowance are provided over the estimated useful life of the related aircraft and engine the majority of our supply and fuel are reported at weighted average cost property and equipment expenditure for major addition improvement and flight equipment modification are capitalized when such cost are determined to extend the useful life of the asset or are part of the cost of acquiring the asset expenditure for equipment overhaul cost of engine or airframe prior to their operational use are capitalized part of the cost of such asset they are cost required to ready the asset for it intended use maintenance and repair cost are charged to expense incurred except for certain aircraft engine maintenance cost incurred under third party service agreement these agreement result in cost being expensed based on cycle or hour flown and are subject to annual escalation these service contract transfer risk to third party service provider and generally fix the amount we pay for maintenance to the service provider rate per cycle or flight hour in exchange for maintenance and repair under predefined maintenance program we capitalize certain direct internal and external cost associated with the development of internal use software gain and loss on sale of property used in operation are classified within operating expense and historically have been nominal for financial reporting purpose we record depreciation and amortization of property and equipment on straight line basis over the asset service life or related lease term if shorter for income tax purpose depreciation is computed using accelerated method when applicable the depreciable life and net book value of our property and equipment are follows dollar in million net book value at may range wide body aircraft and related equipment to year narrow body and feeder aircraft and related equipment to year package handling and ground support equipment to year information technology to year vehicle and trailer to year facility and other to year substantially all property and equipment have no material residual value the majority of aircraft cost are depreciated on straight line basis over to year we periodically evaluate the estimated service life and residual value used to depreciate our property and equipment depreciation and amortization expense excluding gain and loss on sale of property and equipment used in operation wa billion in billion in and billion in depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of asset under capital lease fedex corporation note to consolidated financial statement capitalized interest interest on fund used to finance the acquisition and modification of aircraft including purchase deposit construction of certain facility and development of certain software up to the date the asset is ready for it intended use is capitalized and included in the cost of the asset if the asset is actively under construction capitalized interest wa million in million in and million in impairment of long lived asset long lived asset are reviewed for impairment when circumstance indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable for asset that are to be held and used an impairment is recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flow associated with the asset or group of asset is le than their carrying value if impairment exists an adjustment is made to write the asset down to it fair value and loss is recorded the difference between the carrying value and fair value fair value are determined based on quoted market value discounted cash flow or internal and external appraisal applicable asset to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value we operate integrated transportation network and accordingly cash flow for most of our operating asset to be held and used are assessed at network level not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment in the normal management of our aircraft fleet we routinely idle aircraft and engine temporarily due to maintenance cycle and adjustment of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand level temporarily idled asset are classified available for use and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these asset these temporarily idled asset are assessed for impairment on quarterly basis the criterion for determining whether an asset ha been permanently removed from service and result is potentially impaired include but are not limited to our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume level including capacity need during our peak shipping season the introduction of new fleet type or decision to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operation and change to planned service expansion activity at may we had seven aircraft temporarily idled these aircraft have been idled for an average of month and are expected to return to revenue service sale of business on april we sold non core business of tnt express tnt express and recorded gain of million in the fedex express segment goodwill goodwill is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net asset of business acquired several factor give rise to goodwill in our acquisition such the expected benefit from synergy of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment in our evaluation of goodwill impairment we perform qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive we proceed to test goodwill for impairment including comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying value including attributable goodwill fair value for our reporting unit is determined using an income or market approach incorporating market participant consideration and management assumption on revenue growth rate operating margin discount rate and expected capital expenditure fair value determination may include both internal and third party valuation unless circumstance otherwise dictate we perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter intangible asset intangible asset primarily include customer relationship technology asset and trademark acquired in business combination intangible asset are amortized over period ranging from to year either on straight line basis or on basis consistent with the pattern in which the economic benefit are realized pension and postretirement healthcare plan our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan are measured using actuarial technique that reflect management assumption for discount rate investment return on plan asset salary increase expected retirement mortality employee turnover and future increase in healthcare cost we determine the discount rate which is required to be the rate at which the projected benefit obligation pbo could be effectively settled of the measurement date with the assistance of actuary who calculate the yield on theoretical portfolio of high grade corporate bond rated aa or better with cash flow that are designed to match our expected benefit payment in future year we use the fair value of plan asset to calculate the expected return on asset eroa for interim and segment reporting purpose our eroa is judgmental matter which is reviewed on an annual basis and revised appropriate the accounting guidance related to employer accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of these plan we use mark to market or mtm accounting and immediately recognize change in the fair value of plan asset and actuarial gain or loss in our result annually in the fourth quarter each year the annual mtm adjustment is recognized at the corporate level and doe not impact segment result the remaining component of pension and postretirement healthcare expense primarily service and interest cost and the eroa are recorded on quarterly basis fedex corporation note to consolidated financial statement income tax deferred income tax are provided for the tax effect of temporary difference between the tax basis of asset and liability and their reported amount in the financial statement the liability method is used to account for income tax which requires deferred tax to be recorded at the statutory rate expected to be in effect when the tax are paid deferred income tax asset represent amount available to reduce income tax payable on taxable income in future year such asset arise because of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability well from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deduction and credit by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategy these source of income rely heavily on estimate to make this determination and thus there is risk that these estimate will have to be revised new information is received to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that deferred tax asset will be recovered valuation allowance is established we believe we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefit related to the remaining net deferred tax asset in our consolidated balance sheet that are not subject to valuation allowance we recognize liability for uncertain income tax position based on two step process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any the second step requires to estimate and measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amount we must determine the probability of various possible outcome we reevaluate these uncertain tax position on quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management these reevaluation are based on factor including but not limited to change in fact or circumstance change in tax law successfully settled issue under audit and new audit activity such change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of tax benefit or an increase to the related provision we classify interest related to income tax liability interest expense and if applicable penalty are recognized component of income tax expense the income tax liability and accrued interest and penalty that are due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented current liability the noncurrent portion of our income

recently adopted accounting standard in the financial accounting standard board fasb and international accounting standard board issued new accounting standard that supersedes virtually all existing revenue recognition guidance under gaap the fundamental principle of the new guidance are that company should recognize revenue in manner that reflects the timing of the transfer of service to customer and the amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that company expects to receive for the good and service provided the new guidance establishes five step approach for the recognition of revenue we adopted this standard of june fiscal using the modified retrospective method of adoption permitted by the standard the new guidance did not have an impact on our revenue recognition policy practice or system therefore there wa no cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of june in march the fasb issued an accounting standard update asu that change how employer that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement benefit plan present the net periodic benefit cost in the income statement this new guidance requires entity to report the service cost component in the same line item or item other compensation cost the other component of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component outside of income from operation this standard impact our operating income but ha no impact on our net income or earnings per share we adopted this standard effective june fiscal and applied

pension or other postretirement benefit plan the guidance remove disclosure that are no longer considered cost beneficial clarifies the specific requirement of disclosure and add disclosure requirement identified relevant this new guidance had minimal impact on our financial reporting we adopted these new rule in the fourth quarter of and applied them retrospectively new accounting standard and accounting standard not yet adopted in the fasb issued new lease accounting standard which requires lessee to put most lease on their balance sheet but recognize the expense in their income statement in manner similar to current practice the new standard state that lessee will recognize lease liability for the obligation to make lease payment and right of use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term expense related to lease determined to be operating lease will be recognized on straight line basis while those determined to be financing lease will be recognized following front loaded expense profile in which interest and amortization are presented separately in the income statement the new standard will also require disclosure to help investor and other financial statement user better understand the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flow arising from lease these disclosure include qualitative and quantitative requirement well additional information about the amount recorded in the financial statement we are adopting the new leasing standard using modified retrospective transition method of the beginning of the period of adoption therefore we will not adjust the comparative period presented but will record cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings effective of june we will elect the package of practical expedient permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard which among other thing allows to carry forward the historical accounting relating to lease identification and classification for existing lease upon adoption and to not separate lease and non lease component for certain class of asset we will make an accounting policy election not to recognize lease with an initial term of

provision that took effect in including but not limited to tax on global intangible low taxed income gilti tax deduction for foreign derived intangible income additional limitation on tax deduction for executive compensation and minimum base erosion and anti abuse tax based on certain payment from company to foreign related party we included the impact of the above provision in the computation of our effective tax rate applicable provided for in the tcja our historical earnings were subject to the one time transition tax and can be repatriated to the with de minimis tax cost we continue to assert that both our historical and current earnings in our foreign subsidiary are permanently reinvested and therefore no deferred tax or withholding tax have been provided including deferred tax on any additional outside basis difference stock basis difference attributable to acquisition or other permanent difference during the treasury department issued final regulation covering the one time transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings which wa enacted part of the tcja certain guidance included in these final regulation is inconsistent with our interpretation that led to the recognition of million benefit in and an additional million benefit in notwithstanding this inconsistency we remain confident in our interpretation of the tcja and intend to defend this position through litigation if necessary however if we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position we may be required to reverse the million benefit previously recorded in december the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab to provide guidance to registrant in accounting for income tax under the tcja in accordance with sab we made reasonable estimate and recorded provisional amount for the tcja during under the transitional provision of sab we had one year measurement period to complete the accounting for the initial tax effect of the tcja our accounting is complete for the tax effect of the tcja including the following element initially recorded on provisional basis in we recognized provisional benefit related to the revaluation of deferred tax asset and liability during we revised the provisional benefit associated with the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability result we recognized million tax expense which decreased the billion provisional benefit recorded in in we previously recognized an immaterial provisional benefit from foreign tax credit exceeding the one time transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings no adjustment were made to the provisional estimate during the remeasurement period we have determined to record the tax for gilti period cost the significant component of deferred tax asset and liability of may were follows in million deferred tax asset deferred tax liability deferred tax asset deferred tax liability property equipment lease and intangible employee benefit self insurance accrual other net operating loss credit carryforwards valuation allowance fedex corporation note to consolidated financial statement the net deferred tax liability of may have been classified in the balance sheet follows in million noncurrent deferred tax asset noncurrent deferred tax liability noncurrent deferred tax asset are included in the line item other asset in our consolidated balance sheet we have approximately billion of net operating loss carryovers in various foreign jurisdiction and million of state operating loss carryovers the valuation allowance primarily represent amount reserved for operating loss carryforwards which expire over varying period starting in therefore we establish valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that deferred income tax asset will not be realized we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefit related to the remaining net deferred tax asset in our consolidated balance sheet see note above for more information on our policy for assessing the recoverability of deferred tax asset and valuation allowance we are subject to taxation in the and various state local and foreign jurisdiction the internal revenue service is currently auditing our and tax return we will also be commencing an appeal proceeding in september with respect to our and federal income tax return it is reasonably possible that certain income tax return proceeding will be completed during the next month and could result in change in our balance of unrecognized tax benefit the expected impact of any change would not be material to our consolidated financial statement reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefit is follows in million balance at beginning of year increase for tax position taken in the current year increase for tax position taken in prior year increase for business acquisition decrease for tax position taken in prior year settlement decrease from lapse of statute of limitation change due to currency translation balance at end of year our liability recorded for uncertain tax position include million at may and million at may associated with position that if favorably

the balance of accrued interest and penalty wa million on may and million on may total interest and penalty included in our consolidated statement of income are immaterial it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for tax position change may result from the conclusion of ongoing audit appeal or litigation in state local federal and foreign tax jurisdiction or from the resolution of various proceeding between and foreign tax authority our liability for uncertain tax position includes no matter that are individually or collectively material to it is reasonably possible that the amount of the benefit with respect to certain of our unrecognized tax position will increase or decrease within the next month but an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change can not be made however we do not expect that the resolution of any of our uncertain tax position will have material effect on note retirement plan we sponsor program that provide retirement benefit to most of our employee these program include defined benefit pension plan defined contribution plan and postretirement healthcare plan the accounting guidance related to postretirement benefit requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan and the recognition in either expense or aoci of

annuity contract purchase loss relates to the contract with metropolitan life insurance company discussed below the actual rate of return which is net of all fee and expense on our pension plan asset of wa slightly lower than our expected return of primarily due to generally flat return in the long duration fixed income portfolio partially offset by strong return from global equity the actual rate of return on our pension plan asset which is net of all fee and expense of wa higher than our expected return of primarily due to rise in the value of global equity market in addition to favorable credit market condition the weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan decreased from at may to at may the demographic experience in reflects an update in mortality table for pension and other postemployment benefit plan pension plan our largest pension plan cover certain employee age and over with at least one year of service pension benefit for most employee are accrued under cash balance formula we call the portable pension account ppa under the ppa the retirement benefit is expressed dollar amount in notional account that grows with annual

benefit under this formula were capped on may for most employee we also sponsor or participate in nonqualified benefit plan covering certain of our employee group and other pension plan covering certain of our international employee the international defined benefit pension plan provide benefit primarily based on earnings and year of service and are funded in compliance with local law and

connection with this transaction which wa included in our year end mtm retirement plan accounting adjustment postretirement healthcare plan certain of our subsidiary offer medical dental and vision coverage to eligible retiree and their eligible dependent and small number of international employee employee covered by the principal plan become eligible for these benefit at age and older if they have permanent continuous service of at least year after attainment of age if hired prior to january or at least year after attainment of age if hired on or after january postretirement healthcare benefit are capped at of the per caput projected employer cost which ha been reached under most plan so these benefit are not subject to future inflation effective january certain of our

numerous assumption such discount rate expected long term investment return on plan asset future salary increase employee turnover mortality and retirement age weighted average actuarial assumption used to determine the benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost of our plan are follows pension plan international pension plan postretirement healthcare plan discount rate used to determine benefit obligation discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost rate of increase in future compensation level used to determine benefit obligation rate of increase in future compensation level used to determine net periodic benefit cost expected long term rate of return on asset interest crediting rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost interest crediting rate used to determine benefit obligation our pension plan asset are invested primarily in publicly tradable security and our pension plan hold only minimal investment in fedex common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third party pension fund investment manager part of our strategy to manage pension cost and funded status volatility we follow liability driven investment strategy to better align plan asset with liability fedex corporation note to consolidated financial statement establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension asset is judgmental matter which we review on an annual basis and revise appropriate management considers the following factor in determining this assumption the duration of our pension plan liability which drive the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan asset the type of investment class in which we invest our pension plan asset and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment class to earn over time net of all fee and expense and the investment return we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the return we could expect if investment were made strictly in indexed fund for consolidated pension expense we assumed expected long term rate of return on our pension plan asset in and in and we increased our eroa assumption in to the decrease in the number of retiree in payment status due to the purchase of group annuity contract in may discussed above is expected to reduce our short term future cash outlay and allow the remaining asset to be placed in longer duration investment which will increase the rate of return on asset also the reduction of pension benefit guaranty corporation fixed and variable rate premium should increase the net return on asset for the year period ended may our actual return wa net of all fee and expense the investment strategy for our pension plan asset is to utilize diversified mix of public equity and fixed income and alternative investment to earn long term investment return that meet our pension plan obligation our largest asset class are corporate fixed income security and government fixed income security which are largely benchmarked against the barclays long government barclays long corporate or the citigroup strip index and and non equity which are mainly benchmarked to the index and msci index accordingly we do not have any significant concentration of risk active management strategy are utilized within the plan in an effort to realize investment return in excess of market index our investment strategy also includes the limited use of derivative financial instrument on discretionary basis to improve investment return and manage exposure to market risk the following is description of the valuation methodology used for investment measured at fair value cash and cash equivalent these level investment include cash cash equivalent and foreign currency valued using exchange rate these level investment include short term investment fund which are collective fund priced at constant value by the administrator of the fund domestic international and global equity these level investment are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which the individual security are traded fixed income we determine the fair value of these level corporate bond and non government security and other fixed income security by using bid evaluation pricing model or quoted price of security with similar characteristic alternative investment the valuation of these level investment requires significant judgment due to the absence of quoted market price the inherent lack of liquidity and the long term nature of such asset investment in private equity debt real estate hedge fund and other private investment are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and or general partner these estimate incorporate factor such contribution and distribution market transaction market comparables and performance multiple fedex corporation note to consolidated financial statement the fair

retirement plan well the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized decline in the value of plan asset could diminish the funded status of our pension plan and potentially

transportation commerce and business service the majority of our transaction during the period presented in this annual report are denominated in dollar the principal foreign currency exchange rate risk to which we are exposed are in the euro chinese yuan british pound canadian dollar australian dollar and mexican peso historically our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation is more significant with respect to our revenue than our expense significant portion of our expense are denominated in dollar such aircraft and fuel expense foreign currency fluctuation had slightly positive impact on operating income in and slightly negative impact on operating income in however favorable foreign currency fluctuation also may have had an offsetting impact on the price we obtained or the demand for our service which is not quantifiable at may the result of uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currency in which our transaction are denominated would result in decrease in operating income of million for this theoretical calculation required under sec guideline assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the dollar which is not consistent with our actual experience in foreign currency transaction in addition to the direct effect of change in exchange rate fluctuation in exchange rate also affect the volume of sale or the foreign currency sale price competitor service become more or le attractive the sensitivity analysis of the effect of change in foreign currency exchange rate doe not factor in potential change in
