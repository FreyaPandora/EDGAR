significantly below the historic statutory rate most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non business operation and of december we have not decided to repatriate these earnings to the result of tax reform substantially all of our prior unrepatriated tax earnings were subject to tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate those earnings without additional federal tax cost and any foreign withholding tax on repatriation to the would potentially be partially offset by foreign tax credit we will update our analysis of investment of foreign earnings in we consider the impact of tax reform the rate of tax on our indefinitely reinvested non earnings is below the historic statutory tax rate because we have significant business operation subject to tax in country where the tax on that income is lower than the statutory rate and because ge fund certain non operation through foreign company that are subject to low foreign tax substantial portion of the benefit related to business operation subject to tax in country where the tax on that income is lower than the statutory rate is derived from our gecas aircraft leasing operation located in ireland where the earnings are taxed at from our power operation located in switzerland and hungary where the earnings are taxed at between and and our healthcare operation in europe where tax deduction are allowed for certain intangible asset and earnings are taxed below the historic statutory rate we expect our ability to benefit from non income taxed at le than the rate to continue subject to change in or foreign

will be reduced or eliminated going forward part of tax reform the ha enacted tax on base eroding payment from the we are evaluating the impact of this new provision on our operation and intend to

technique including match funding and selective use of derivative we use derivative to mitigate or eliminate certain financial and market risk because we conduct business in diverse market around the world and local funding is not always efficient in addition we use derivative to adjust the debt we are issuing to match the fixed or floating nature of the asset we are originating we apply strict policy to manage each of these risk including prohibition on speculative activity following is an analysis of the potential effect of change in interest rate and currency exchange rate using so called shock test that seek to model the effect of shift in rate such test are inherently limited based on the assumption used described further below and should not be viewed forecast actual effect would depend on many variable including market factor and the composition of the company asset and liability at that time it is our policy to minimize exposure to interest rate change and their impact to interest and other financial charge we fund our financial investment using debt or combination of debt and hedging instrument so that the interest rate of our borrowing match the expected interest rate profile on our asset to test the effectiveness of our hedging action we assumed that on january interest rate decreased by basis point across the yield curve parallel shift in that curve and further assumed that the decrease remained in place for the next month based on the year end portfolio and holding all other assumption constant we estimated that our consolidated net earnings for the next month starting in january would decline by le than billion result of this parallel shift in the yield curve it is our policy to minimize currency exposure and to conduct operation either within functional currency or using the protection of hedge strategy we analyzed year end consolidated currency exposure including derivative designated and effective hedge to identify asset and liability denominated in other than their relevant functional currency for such asset and liability we evaluated the effect of shift in exchange rate between those currency and the dollar holding all other assumption constant this analysis indicated that our consolidated net earnings would decline by le than billion result of such shift in exchange rate this analysis excludes any translation impact from

technique to manage the effect of currency exchange including selective borrowing in local currency and selective hedging of significant cross currency transaction the foreign currency effect arising from operating activity outside of the including the remeasurement of derivative can result in significant transactional foreign currency fluctuation at point in time but will generally be offset the

accounting estimate and assumption discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statement because they involve significant judgment and uncertainty many of these estimate include determining fair value all of these estimate reflect our best judgment about current and for some estimate future economic and market condition and their potential effect based on information available of the date of these financial statement if these condition change from those expected it is reasonably possible that the judgment and estimate described below could change which may result in future impairment of investment security goodwill intangible and long lived asset revision to estimated profitability on long term product service agreement incremental loss on financing receivables increase in reserve for contingency establishment of valuation allowance on deferred tax asset and increased tax liability among other effect also see note to the consolidated financial statement which discus our most significant accounting policy revenue recognition on long term product service agreement we have long term service agreement with our customer predominately within our power aviation transportation and oil and gas segment these agreement require to maintain the customer asset over the contract term contract term are generally to year however contract modification that extend or revise contract are not uncommon we recognize revenue we perform under the arrangement based upon cost incurred at the estimated margin rate of the contract revenue recognition on long term product service agreement requires estimate of both customer payment expected to be received over the contract term well the cost to perform required maintenance service customer generally pay based on the utilization of the asset per hour of usage for example or upon the occurrence of major event within the contract such an overhaul result significant estimate in determining expected revenue of contract is estimating how customer will utilize their asset over the term of the agreement the estimate of utilization will impact both the amount of customer payment we expect to receive and our estimate of cost to complete the agreement asset utilization will influence the timing and extent of overhaul and other service event over the life of the contract we generally use combination of both historical utilization trend well forward looking information such market condition and potential asset retirement in developing our revenue estimate to develop our cost estimate we consider the timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul event including the amount and cost of labor spare part and other resource required to perform the service in developing our cost estimate we utilize combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvement cost improvement are only included in future cost estimate after saving have been observed in actual result or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process we routinely review estimate under product service agreement and regularly revise them to adjust for change in outlook these revision are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review contract modification to exercise purchase option add work scope or extend the contract term are generally accounted for revision to our future revenue and expected cost estimate certain contract modification that significantly change the nature timing and extent of remaining cash flow are effectively accounted for new contract the difference between the timing of our revenue recognition and cash received from our customer result in either contract asset revenue in excess of billing or contract liability billing in excess of revenue of december and we are in net contract asset position of billion and billion including contract in liability position totaling billion and billion respectively we regularly ass customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amount of receivables and contract asset and estimated earnings including the risk that contractual penalty may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination we gain insight into future utilization and cost trend well credit risk through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and the close interaction with our customer that come with supplying critical service and part over extended period revision may affect product service agreement total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings such adjustment increased earnings by billion billion and billion in and respectively we provide for probable loss when they become evident see note and to the consolidated financial statement for further information ge form md acritical accounting estimate asset impairment asset impairment assessment involves various estimate and assumption follows investmentswe regularly review investment security for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criterion for debt security if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost we evaluate other qualitative criterion to determine whether credit loss exists such the financial health of and specific prospect for the issuer including whether the issuer is in compliance with the term and covenant of the security quantitative criterion include determining whether there ha been an adverse change in expected future cash flow for equity security our criterion include the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position our other than temporary impairment review involve our finance risk and asset management function well the portfolio management and research capability of our internal and third party asset manager see note to the consolidated financial statement which discus the determination of fair value of investment security see note and to the consolidated financial statement for further information about actual and potential impairment loss long lived asset we review long lived asset for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment ha occurred typically requires various estimate and assumption including determining which undiscounted cash flow are directly related to the potentially impaired asset the useful life over which cash flow will occur their amount and the asset residual value if any in turn measurement of an impairment loss requires determination of fair value which is based on the best information available we derive the required undiscounted cash flow estimate from our historical experience and our internal business plan to determine fair value we use quoted market price when available our internal cash flow estimate discounted at an appropriate discount rate and independent appraisal appropriate our operating lease portfolio of commercial aircraft is significant concentration of asset in capital and is particularly subject to market fluctuation therefore we test recoverability of each aircraft in our operating lease portfolio at least annually additionally we perform quarterly evaluation in circumstance such when aircraft are re leased current lease term have changed or specific lessee credit standing change we consider market condition such global demand for commercial aircraft estimate of future rental and residual value are based on historical experience and information received routinely from independent appraiser estimated cash flow from future lease are reduced for expected downtime between lease and for estimated cost required to prepare aircraft to be redeployed fair value used to measure impairment is based on management best estimate which are benchmarked against third party appraiser current market value for aircraft of similar type and age see note and to the consolidated financial statement for further information on impairment loss and our exposure to the commercial aviation industry goodwill and other identified intangible assetswe test goodwill for impairment annually in the third quarter of each year using data of july the impairment test consists of two step in step one the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared with it fair value in step two which is applied when the carrying value is more than it fair value the amount of goodwill impairment if any is derived by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit asset and liability from the fair value of it equity and comparing that amount with the carrying amount of goodwill we determined fair value for each of the reporting unit using the market approach when available and appropriate or the income approach or combination of both we ass the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation if multiple valuation methodology are used the result are weighted appropriately valuation using the market approach are derived from metric of publicly traded company or historically completed transaction of comparable business the selection of comparable business is based on the market in which the reporting unit operate giving consideration to risk profile size geography and diversity of product and service market approach is limited to reporting unit for which there are publicly traded company that have the characteristic similar to our business under the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flow discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted rate we use our internal forecast to estimate future cash flow and include an estimate of long term future growth rate based on our most recent view of the long term outlook for each business actual result may differ from those assumed in our forecast we derive our discount rate using capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rate for industry relevant to our reporting unit to estimate the cost of equity financing we use discount rate that are commensurate with the risk and uncertainty inherent in the respective business and in our internally developed forecast discount rate used in our reporting unit valuation ranged from to ge form md acritical accounting estimate estimating the fair value of reporting unit requires the use of estimate and significant judgment that are based on number of factor including actual operating result it is reasonably possible that the judgment and estimate described above could change in future period during the third quarter of we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill for all of our reporting unit based on the result of our step one testing the fair value of each of the ge reporting unit exceeded their carrying value except for the power conversion reporting unit within our power segment therefore we performed the second step of the impairment test and recognized non cash goodwill impairment loss of million during the third quarter in the fourth quarter of we performed an interim impairment test at our power conversion reporting unit and energy financial service reporting unit within our capital segment which indicated that the carrying value for each of these reporting unit were in excess of it fair value we therefore performed the second step of the impairment test which resulted in non cash impairment loss of million and million at our power conversion and energy financial service reporting unit respectively we review identified intangible asset with defined useful life and subject to amortization for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flow expected to be generated by the asset we test intangible asset with indefinite life annually for impairment using fair value method such discounted cash flow see note and to the consolidated financial statement for further information business and asset held for salebusinesses and asset held for sale represent component that meet the accounting requirement to be classified held for sale and are presented single asset and liability amount in our financial statement with valuation allowance if necessary to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fair value le cost to sell financing receivables that no longer qualify to be presented held for investment must be classified asset held for sale and recognized in our financial statement at the lower of cost or fair value le cost to sell with that amount representing new cost basis at the date of transfer the determination of fair value for business and asset held for sale involves significant judgment and assumption development of estimate of fair value in this circumstance is complex and is dependent upon among other factor the nature of the potential sale transaction for example asset sale versus sale of legal entity composition of asset and or business in the disposal group the comparability of the disposal group to market transaction negotiation with third party purchaser etc such factor bear directly on the range of potential fair value and the selection of the best estimate key assumption are developed based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with market participant would use in hypothetical transaction we review all business and asset held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amount are fully recoverable in comparison to estimated fair value pension assumption pension assumption are significant input to the actuarial model that measure pension benefit obligation and related effect on operation two assumption discount rate and expected return on asset are important element of plan expense and asset liability measurement we evaluate these critical assumption at least annually on plan and country specific basis we periodically evaluate other assumption involving demographic factor such retirement age mortality and turnover and update them to reflect our experience and expectation for the future actual result in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumption because of economic and other factor projected benefit obligation are measured the present value of expected payment we discount those cash payment using the weighted average of market observed yield for high quality fixed income security with maturity that correspond to the payment of benefit lower discount rate increase present value and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rate decrease present value and subsequent year pension expense our discount rate for principal pension plan at december and were and respectively reflecting market interest rate ge form md acritical accounting estimate to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan asset we consider current and target asset allocation well historical and expected return on various category of plan asset in developing future long term return expectation for our principal benefit plan asset we formulate view on the future economic environment both in the and abroad we evaluate general market trend and historical relationship among number of key variable that impact asset class return such expected earnings growth inflation valuation yield and spread using both internal and external source we also take into account expected volatility by asset class and diversification across class to determine expected overall portfolio result given current and target allocation asset in our principal pension plan earned in and had average annual return of and per year in the and year period ended december respectively the average historical and year return were significantly affected by investment loss in based on our analysis of future expectation of asset performance past return result and our current and target asset allocation including our previously announced billion expected contribution to the ge pension plan in we have assumed long term expected return on those asset for cost recognition in compared to in and change in key assumption for our principal pension plan would have the following effect discount rate basis point increase in discount rate would decrease pension cost in the following year by billion and would decrease the pension benefit obligation at year end by about billion expected return on asset basis point decrease in the expected return on asset would increase pension cost in the following year by billion see other consolidated information postretirement benefit plan section within the md and note to the consolidated financial statement for further information on our pension plan income taxesour annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rate and tax planning opportunity available to in the various jurisdiction in which we operate tax law are complex and subject to different interpretation by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authority significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax position including evaluating uncertainty we review our tax position quarterly and adjust the balance new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operation in addition to local country tax law and regulation this rate depends on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the historically tax were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings due to the enactment of tax reform repatriation of foreign earnings will generally be free of federal income tax but may incur withholding or state tax indefinite reinvestment is determined by management judgment about and intention concerning the future operation of the company most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non business operation at december we have not changed our indefinite reinvestment decision result of tax reform but will reassess this during the course of we consider the impact of tax reform deferred income tax asset represent amount available to reduce income tax payable on taxable income in future year such asset arise because of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability well from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deduction and credit by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategy these source of income rely heavily on estimate we use our historical experience and our short and long range business forecast to provide insight further our global and diversified business portfolio give the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategy to facilitate the recoverability of future deduction amount recorded for deferred tax asset related to non net operating loss net of valuation allowance were billion and billion at december and including billion and billion at december and respectively of deferred tax asset net of valuation allowance associated with loss reported in discontinued operation primarily related to our real estate and consumer business and our loss on the sale of ge money japan such year end amount are expected to be fully recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration period to the extent we consider it more likely than not that deferred tax asset will not be recovered valuation allowance is established the impact of tax reform ha been recorded on provisional basis the legislation provides for additional guidance to be issued by the department of the treasury on several provision including the computation of the transition tax on historic foreign earnings guidance during could impact the information required for and the calculation of the transition tax charge and could affect decision on timing of various and foreign item which would further impact the final amount included in the transition charge and the revaluation of deferred tax in addition analysis performed and conclusion reached part of the tax return filing process and additional guidance on accounting for tax reform could affect the provisional amount ge form md acritical accounting estimate additionally part of tax reform the ha enacted tax on base eroding payment from the we are evaluating the impact of this new provision on our operation and intend to restructure ongoing operation to avoid significant impact from this provision the ha also enacted minimum tax on foreign earnings global intangible low taxed income because we have tangible asset outside the and pay rate of foreign tax above the minimum tax rate we are not expecting significant increase in tax liability from this new minimum tax because aspect of the new law and the effect on our operation is uncertain and because aspect of the accounting rule associated with the tax on global intangible low taxed income have not been resolved we have not made provisional accrual for the deferred tax effect and consequently have not yet made an accounting policy election on the deferred tax treatment of this tax see other consolidated information income tax section within the md and note to the consolidated financial statement for further information on income tax derivative and hedgingwe use derivative to manage variety of risk including risk related to interest rate foreign exchange and commodity price accounting for derivative hedge requires that at inception and over the term of the arrangement the hedged item and related derivative meet the requirement for hedge accounting the rule and interpretation related to derivative accounting are complex failure to apply this complex guidance correctly will result in all change in the fair value of the derivative being reported in earnings without regard to the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item in evaluating whether particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting we test effectiveness at inception and each reporting period thereafter by determining whether change in the fair value of the derivative offset within specified range change in the fair value of the hedged item if fair value change fail this test we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are calculated using internal valuation model incorporating market based assumption subject to third party confirmation applicable see note and to the

debt and equity security and derivative other asset and liability are subject to fair value measurement only in certain circumstance including purchase accounting applied to asset and liability acquired in business combination impaired loan that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral cost and equity method investment and long lived asset that are written down to fair value when they are impaired upon closing an acquisition we estimate the fair value of asset and liability acquired and integrate the acquisition soon practicable the size scope and complexity of an acquisition will affect the time it take to obtain the necessary information to record the acquired asset and liability at fair value it may take up to one year to finalize the initial fair value estimate used in the preliminary purchase accounting accordingly it is reasonably likely that our initial estimate will be subsequently revised which could affect carrying amount of goodwill intangible and potentially other asset and liability in our financial statement asset that are written down to fair value le cost to sell when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs fair value measurement is determined the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date in the absence of active market for the identical asset or liability such measurement involve developing assumption based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participant would use in hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgment about assumption such determining an appropriate discount rate that factor in both risk and liquidity premium identifying the similarity and difference in market transaction weighting those difference accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustment to those market transaction to reflect the risk specific to our asset being valued see note and to the consolidated financial statement for further information on fair value measurement and related matter other loss contingency other loss contingency are uncertain and unresolved matter that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from event or action by others that have the potential to result in future loss such contingency include but are not limited to environmental obligation litigation regulatory proceeding product quality and loss resulting from other event and development ge form md acritical accounting estimate when loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss when there appears to be range of possible cost with equal likelihood liability are based on the low end of such range however the likelihood of loss with respect to particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining meaningful estimate of the loss or range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future event and decision by third party that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency moreover it is not uncommon for such matter to be resolved over many year during which time relevant development and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate range of possible loss when loss is probable but reasonable estimate can not be made disclosure is provided disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of loss will exceed the recorded provision we regularly review all contingency to determine whether the likelihood of loss ha changed and to ass whether reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made discussed above development of meaningful estimate of loss or range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiation with or decision by third party such regulatory agency the court system and other interested party such factor bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate range of potential loss and boundary of high and low estimate see note to the consolidated financial statement for further information insurance and investment contract liabilitiesinsurance and investment contract liability amounted to billion and billion at december and respectively these primarily comprise liability for future policy benefit for those claim not yet incurred and claim reserve for claim that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported future policy benefit reserve amounted to billion and billion primarily comprising billion and billion related to long term care insurance contract and billion and billion related to structured settlement annuity and other life and disability insurance product at december and respectively long term care insurance provides defined benefit level of protection against the cost of long term care service provided in the insured home in assisted living or nursing home facility structured settlement annuity typically provide fixed monthly or annual annuity payment through death of the policyholder with some specifying minimum duration of payment while traditional life and disability insurance trigger payment in the event of death or disability of the policyholder future policy benefit reserve represent the present value of future policy benefit le the present value of future net premium and were first established based on actuarial assumption at the time the policy were issued or acquired plus margin for adverse deviation these assumption include but are not limited to interest rate health care experience including type and cost of care morbidity mortality the length of time policy will remain in force and anticipated future premium increase from future in force rate action assumption are locked in throughout the life of contract unless premium deficiency develops our annual premium deficiency testing ass the adequacy of future policy benefit reserve net of capitalized acquisition cost using current assumption the result of historic premium deficiency testing were mostly driven by change in assumption result from line of business experience study and the impact from change in estimated reinvestment rate on investment security we have not originated new policy since during in response to elevated claim experience for portion of our long term care insurance contract that wa most pronounced for policyholder with higher attained age we initiated comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumption across all insurance product which included reconstructing our future claim cost assumption for long term care contract utilizing trend observed in our emerging experience for older claimant age and later duration policy certain of our long term care policyholder only recently started to reach the prime claim paying period and our new claim cost assumption considered the emerging credibility of this claim data in addition to the adverse impact from the revised future claim cost assumption over long term horizon our premium deficiency assumption considered mortality length of time policy will remain in force and both near term and longer term investment return expectation future investment yield estimated in were lower than in previous premium deficiency test primarily due to the effect of near term yield on approximately billion of future expected capital contribution the test indicated premium deficiency resulting in the unlocking of reserve and resetting of actuarial assumption to current assumption this resulted in billion charge to earnings which included billion impairment of deferred acquisition cost billion impairment of present value of future profit and an billion increase in future policy benefit reserve we commenced integrating these new assumption into our system and process embedded in our framework of internal control over financial reporting and expect to continue the integration in we cede our insurance risk to third party reinsurers for portion of our insurance contract we are not relieved from primary obligation to policyholder or cedents we record receivables that are estimated in manner consistent with the future policy benefit reserve and claim reserve reserve ceded to reinsurers net of allowance were billion and billion at december and respectively and are included in the caption other ge capital receivables on our consolidated statement of financial position in connection with our premium deficiency test in addition to reinsurance recoverables of billion were largely offset by an allowance for loss of billion based upon our assessment of collectability that would otherwise have reduced the earnings impact of the premium deficiency the vast majority of our remaining net reinsurance recoverables are secured by asset held in trust for which we are the beneficiary ge form md acritical accounting estimate comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumption is complex process and depends on number of factor many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance product the vast majority of our run off insurance operation comprises reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entity with underlying treaty having unique term and condition premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entity and considers each of the unique treaty in order to utilize that information for purpose of completing experience study covering all key assumption we perform detailed procedure to conform and validate the data received including periodic evaluation of the operating environment at ceding entity our long term care business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained age is still emerging and to the extent that future experience deviate from current expectation new projection of claim cost extending over the expected life of the policy may be required significant uncertainty exist in making current projection for these long duration insurance contract that include consideration of wide range of possible outcome well actuarial peer review before final determination can be made in response to the premium deficiency our future policy benefit reserve at december were unlocked and updated to reflect our most recent assumption the primary assumption used in the premium deficiency test include morbidity morbidity assumption used in estimating future policy benefit reserve are based on estimate of expected incidence of disability and claim cost and include consideration of antiselection and estimate of expected future morbidity improvement historical premium deficiency assumption considered the risk of antiselection by including issue age adjustment to morbidity based on an actuarial assumption that long term care policy issued to younger individual have exhibited lower expected incidence and claim cost than those issued to older policyholder recent claim experience and the development of reconstructed claim cost curve indicated minimal issue age adjustment impacting claim cost projection and accordingly in issue age adjustment were no longer assumed in developing morbidity assumption mortality mortality assumption used in estimating future policy benefit reserve are based on published mortality table adjusted for the result of our experience study and estimate of expected future mortality improvement for life insurance product higher mortality increase our future policy benefit reserve while for annuity and long term care insurance contract higher mortality decrease our future policy benefit reserve discount rate interest rate assumption used in estimating future policy benefit reserve are based on expected investment yield net of related investment expense in estimating future yield we consider the actual yield on our current investment security held by our run off insurance operation the future rate at which we expect to reinvest any proceeds from investment security maturity and the average long term yield we expect from the proceeds of estimated future capital contribution into our run off insurance operation such contribution may comprise cash that will be used to purchase investment security or other qualifying investment from ge capital portfolio the adverse impact on our statutory reserve arising from our revised assumption including the collectability of reinsurance recoverables is expected to require ge capital to contribute approximately billion additional capital to it run off insurance operation in subject to ongoing monitoring by the kansa insurance department ge is required to maintain specified capital level at these insurance subsidiary under capital maintenance agreement the cash component of the capital contribution will be invested at the current market yield at the time of contribution which ha the impact of lowering the average long term investment yield used to calculate the discount rate and such further adversely impacted the estimated premium deficiency our discount rate assumption for purpose of performing premium deficiency assessment ranged from in with weighted average rate of across different tenor and in with weighted average rate of future long term care premium rate increase we consider recent experience with rate increase in establishing our current expectation reinsurer we rely upon the primary insurer that underwrite the underlying policy to propose rate increase to the relevant state insurance regulator we have no ability to institute premium rate increase on the policyholder we perform premium deficiency testing at least annually the result of this test are sensitive to the assumption described above any future adverse change in our assumption could result in an increase to future policy benefit reserve for example hypothetical five percent increase in future claim cost holding all other assumption constant would result in billion increase to our future policy benefit reserve similarly hypothetical basis point decline in expected investment yield holding all other assumption constant would result in billion increase in future policy benefit reserve any favorable change to these assumption could result in additional margin in our premium deficiency test and higher income over the remaining duration of the portfolio including higher investment income claim reserve amounted to billion and billion of which billion and billion relates to long term care insurance contract of december and respectively claim reserve are established when claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred and represents our best estimate of the ultimate obligation for future claim payment and claim adjustment expense key input include actual known fact about the claim such the benefit available and cause of disability of the claimant well assumption derived from our actual historical experience and expected future change in experience factor claim reserve are evaluated periodically for potential change in loss estimate with the support of qualified

guidance including asc revenue recognition construction type and production type contract the new standard will become effective for annual reporting period beginning after december we will adopt the standard on january will apply it retrospectively to all period presented and will elect the practical expedient for contract modification change in timing and presentation no impact to cash or economicsthe new standard requires company to identify contractual performance obligation and determine whether revenue should be recognized at point in time or over time based on when control of good and service transfer to customer result we expect significant change in the presentation of our financial statement including timing of revenue recognition and change in classification between revenue and cost the new standard will have no cash impact and such doe not affect the economics of our underlying customer contract the effect of applying the new guidance to our existing book of contract will result in lower reported earnings in and comparative period previously reported and in the early year after adoption however we expect to experience an increase in reported earnings on that existing book of contract they mature the new standard will provide for better alignment of cash and earnings for the affected long term customer contract and we expect that it will enhance comparability across industry peer specific effect on ge businessespower and aviation service agreement for our long term product service agreement primarily in our power and aviation business we expect to continue to recognize revenue based on cost incurred plus an estimated margin rate over time model however the new standard provides prescriptive guidance tied to several factor for determining what constitutes the proper scope of customer contract for accounting purpose these factor include optional purchase contract modification and termination clause for example under the new standard contract modification will be accounted for prospectively by recognizing the financial effect of the modification over the remaining life of the contract under existing accounting guidance revision to estimated margin rate resulting from modification were reflected cumulative effect adjustment to earnings in the current period aviation commercial engine consistent with industry peer the financial presentation of our aviation commercial engine business will be significantly affected they will be accounted for of point in time which is change from our current long term contract accounting process our current process applies contract specific estimated margin rate which include the effect of estimated cost improvement to cost incurred this change is required because our commercial engine contract do not transfer control to the customer during the manufacturing process each install and spare engine will be accounted for separate performance obligation reflecting the actual price and manufacturing cost of such engine we expect that the most significant effect of this change will be reflected when we have new engine launch where the cost of earlier production unit is higher than the cost of later production unit because of cost improvement all other large equipment for the remainder of our equipment business the new revenue standard requires emphasis on transfer of control rather than risk and reward which may accelerate timing of revenue recognition versus our current practice for example in our renewable energy business we wait for risk of loss to be assumed by the customer before recognizing revenue which generally occurs later than when control is transferred ge form md aother item current range of financial statement effectwe will adopt the new standard of january when we report our result the comparative result for and will be updated to reflect the application of the requirement of the new standard to these period based on our assessment and best estimate to date we expect non cash charge to our january retained earnings balance of approximately billion we estimate that the charge will comprise approximately billion related to commercial aircraft engine and billion related primarily to our service business predominately in power and aviation beyond those effect we expect application of the new guidance will result in increase and decrease in revenue within our segment which will largely offset overall and will be immaterial at total company level we estimate that our and restated earnings per share will be lower by approximately and before any impact from tax reform respectively driven primarily by the required change in accounting for long term product service arrangement described above these estimate may be refined we finalize the implementation effort required to adopt the standard upon adoption in our book and record will only reflect the result required under the new standard limiting our ability to estimate the effect of the standard on our earnings given the inherent difficulty in this ongoing estimation of the effect of the standard on any future period we do not plan to continue to ass the effect on to summarize we will adopt the new standard in at which time we will update prior period to be presented on consistent basis discussed above we anticipate dilutive effect of the new standard in the year of adoption consistent with the effect to the restated and result and the effect will be le dilutive for year after initial adoption however this expectation is based on many variable including underlying business performance which are subject to change making the effect of the standard on future period difficult to estimate importantly application of the new guidance ha no effect on the cash we expect to receive the economics of these contract rather it will simply more closely align revenue with cash which we believe will be helpful to our investor mine safety disclosuresour

section and the consolidated financial statement and related note we also incorporate the risk described in baker hughes ge company form report and other sec filing the risk we describe in this form report or in our other sec filing could have material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and result of operation our business routinely encounter and address risk some of which will cause our future result to be different sometimes materially different than we presently anticipate below we describe certain important strategic operational financial and legal and compliance risk our reaction to material future development well our competitor reaction to those development will affect our future result strategic risksstrategic risk relates to the company future business plan and strategy including the risk associated with the global macro environment in which we operate disposition merger and acquisition and restructuring activity intellectual property and other risk including the demand for our product and service competitive threat the success of investment in our digital and additive business technology and other product and service innovation global macro environment our growth is subject to global economic and political risk we operate in virtually every part of the world and serve customer in over country in of our revenue wa attributable to activity outside the united state our operation and the execution of our business plan and strategy are subject to the effect of global competition and geopolitical risk they are also affected by local and regional economic environment including interest rate monetary policy inflation recession currency volatility currency control or other limitation on the ability to expatriate cash and actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt for example change in local economic condition or fluctuation in exchange rate may affect product demand or the profitability of our non operating unit and the impact on the company could be significant given the extent of our activity outside the political change and trend such populism protectionism economic nationalism and sentiment toward multinational company and resulting change to trade tax or other law and policy may be disruptive and can interfere with our global operating model our supply chain our customer relationship and competitive position we also do business in many emerging market jurisdiction such egypt angola nigeria and venezuela where economic political and legal risk are heightened while some global economic risk can be hedged using derivative or other financial instrument and some are insurable such attempt to mitigate these risk are costly and not always successful and our ability to engage in such mitigation may decrease or become even more costly result of more volatile market condition business portfolio the success of our business depends on achieving our strategic objective including through disposition acquisition and business integration and joint venture previously announced management ha identified over billion of asset to be exited in the next year or two and continues to review strategic portfolio option we seek to sell certain asset or business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyer or executing alternative exit strategy on acceptable term which could delay or prevent the accomplishment of our strategic and financial objective we may dispose of asset or business at price or on term that are le favorable than we had anticipated or with the exclusion of asset that must be divested or run off separately we may also face limitation in the form of regulatory or governmental approval that prevent certain prospective purchaser from completing transaction with or arising from our debt or other contractual obligation that limit our ability to complete certain asset or business disposition the effect of these disposition over time may reduce the company cash flow and earnings capacity and result in le diversified portfolio of business and executing on the disposition can divert senior management time and resource from other pursuit disposition may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such through continuing equity ownership transition service agreement guarantee indemnity or other current or contingent financial obligation under these arrangement performance by the divested business or other condition outside our control could materially affect our future financial result with respect to acquisition joint venture and business integration we may not achieve expected return and other benefit result of integration and collaboration challenge related to personnel it system or other factor for example our anticipated return from merger and acquisition such the alstom acquisition in or the combination of our oil gas business with baker hughes that we completed in july include cost and growth synergy benefit over multi year period that we may not fully realize result of these and other acquisition over time we have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible asset on our balance sheet and if we are not able to realize the value of these asset we may be required to incur charge relating to the impairment of these asset we also participate in number of joint venture with other company or government enterprise in various market around the world including joint venture where we may have lesser degree of control over the business operation which may expose to additional operational financial legal or compliance risk ge form risk factor restructuring we may not realize expected benefit from our cost reduction and restructuring effort and these effort may have adverse effect on our operation employee retention and result we are undertaking extensive restructuring action that include workforce reduction global facility consolidation and other cost reduction initiative both in connection with existing and recently acquired operation these action are central component of our effort to improve operational and financial performance if we do not successfully manage our restructuring activity expected efficiency and benefit might be delayed or not realized and our operation and business could be disrupted risk associated with these action include unforeseen delay in implementation of workforce reduction additional unexpected cost adverse effect on employee morale loss of key employee or other retention issue inability to attract and hire talented professional or the failure to meet operational target due to the loss of employee or work stoppage any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reduction or may otherwise harm our business and have an adverse effect on our competitive position or financial performance competitive environment we are dependent on the maintenance of existing product line and service relationship market acceptance of new product and service introduction and innovation for revenue and earnings growth the market in which we operate are highly competitive in term of pricing product and service quality product development and introduction time customer service financing term and shift in market demand and competitor are increasingly offering service for our installed base our business are also subject to technological change and require to continually attract and retain skilled talent our long term operating result and competitive position depend substantially upon our ability to continually develop introduce and market new and innovative product and service to modify existing product and service to customize product and service to increase our productivity we perform on long term service agreement to anticipate and respond to market and technological change driven by trend such increased digitization or automation or by development such climate change that present both risk and opportunity for our business failure to be adequately market based or to accurately forecast customer demand and industry trend may adversely affect our delivery of product service and outcome in line with our projected financial performance or cost estimate and ultimately may result in excess cost build up of inventory that becomes obsolete lower profit margin and an erosion of our competitive position for example increased use of alternative energy source due to greater cost competitiveness of such source or change in technology or consumer preference could adversely affect the demand for our product and related service that are used in power generation or other application that use oil or natural gas energy source and result could have material adverse effect on the performance of our business or our consolidated result the introduction of innovative and disruptive technology in the market in which we operate can also pose risk in the form new competitor substitution of existing product service or solution niche player new business model and competitor that are faster to market with new product or service than we are we invest substantial amount in research and development effort to pursue advancement in wide range of technology product and service these effort divert resource from other potential investment in our business and our effort may not lead to the development of new technology or product on timely basis or meet the need of our customer fully competitive offering intellectual property our intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitor from independently developing product and service similar to or duplicative to and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted by external dependency our patent and other intellectual property may not prevent competitor from independently developing or selling product and service similar to or duplicative of ours and there can be no assurance that the resource invested by to protect our intellectual property will be sufficient or that our intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of our technology in the context of the company recent performance and potential portfolio action the value of the ge brand may be negatively impacted and we may offer multiple long term and concurrent trademark license of the ge brand in connection with disposition that may negatively impact the overall value of the brand in the future result of increased number of employee exit due to restructuring activity or otherwise we also face heightened risk related to the loss or unauthorized use of the company intellectual property or other protected data we could also face competition in some country where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio if we are not able to protect our intellectual property the value of our brand and other intangible asset may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected we also face attempt to gain unauthorized access to our it system or product for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secret or confidential business information the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secret and other confidential business information result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and the value of our investment in research and development in addition we may be the target of enforcement of patent by third party including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claim by non practicing entity regardless of the merit of such claim responding to infringement claim can be expensive and time consuming if ge is found to infringe any third party right we could be required to pay substantial damage or we could be enjoined from offering some of our product and service the value of or our ability to use our intellectual property may also be negatively impacted by dependency on third party such our ability to obtain or renew on reasonable term license that we need in the future or our ability to secure or retain ownership or right to use data in certain software analytics or service offering ge form risk factor operational risksoperational risk relates to risk arising from system process people and external event that affect the operation of our business it includes risk related to product and service life cycle and execution product safety and performance information management and data protection and security including cybersecurity and supply chain and business disruption operational execution we may face operational challenge that could have material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and result of operation the company financial result depend on the successful execution of our business operating plan across all step of the product and service development production marketing sale servicing and cash collection lifecycle organizational change including result of restructuring action that lead to employee attrition or declining labor relation could adversely affect our ability to manage operational challenge operational failure could result in quality problem or potential product labor safety or environmental risk which could have material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and result of operation in addition an increasing portion of our business involves large project where we take on the full scope of engineering procurement construction or other service these type of project can pose unique risk related to their scale complexity and duration performance issue can arise due to inadequate technical expertise development at project site safety issue subcontractor consortium partner and compliance with government regulation and can lead to cost overrun contractual penalty and other adverse consequence such project become more significant part of our business model the risk will become greater that operational quality or other issue at particular project could adversely affect ge business reputation or result of operation product safety our product and service are highly sophisticated and specialized and major product failure or similar event could adversely affect our business reputation financial position and result of operation we produce highly sophisticated product and provide specialized service for both our and third party product that incorporate or use complex or leading edge technology including both hardware and software many of our product and service involve complex industrial machinery or infrastructure project such commercial jet engine offshore oil and gas drilling or nuclear power generation and accordingly the impact of catastrophic product failure or similar event could be significant while we have built operational process to ensure that our product design manufacture performance and servicing meet rigorous quality standard there can be no assurance that we or our customer or other third party will not experience operational process or product failure and other problem including through manufacturing or design defect process or other failure of contractor or third party supplier cyber attack or other intentional act that could result in potential product safety regulatory or environmental risk cybersecurity increased cybersecurity requirement vulnerability threat and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose risk to our system network product solution service and data increased global cybersecurity vulnerability threat computer virus and more sophisticated and targeted cyber related attack well cybersecurity failure resulting from human error and technological error pose risk to the security of ge and it customer partner supplier and third party service provider product system and network and the confidentiality availability and integrity of ge and it customer data the perpetrator of such attack become more capable and critical infrastructure is increasingly becoming digitized the risk in this area continue to grow while we attempt to mitigate these risk by employing number of measure including employee training monitoring and testing and maintenance of protective system and contingency plan we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threat and there is no assurance that the impact from such threat will not be material in addition to existing risk the adoption of new technology may also increase our exposure to cybersecurity breach and failure we also may have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information in certain of our business that is subject to privacy and security law regulation or customer imposed control despite our use of reasonable and appropriate control to protect our system and sensitive confidential or personal data or information we may be vulnerable to material security breach theft misplaced lost or corrupted data programming error employee error and or malfeasance including misappropriation by departing employee that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our system software solution or network unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective product production downtime and operational disruption data privacy and protection law are evolving and present increasing compliance challenge which increase our cost affect our competitiveness and can expose to substantial fine or other penalty in addition cyber related attack could result in other negative consequence including damage to our reputation or competitiveness remediation or increased protection cost litigation or regulatory action supply chain significant raw material shortage supplier capacity constraint supplier production disruption supplier quality and sourcing issue or price increase could increase our operating cost and adversely impact the competitive position of our product our reliance on third party supplier contract manufacturer and service provider and commodity

supplier or their sub supplier are limited or sole source supplier disruption in delivery from our third party supplier contract manufacturer or service provider capacity constraint production disruption price increase or decreased availability of raw material or commodity including result of catastrophic event could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitment to customer or increase our operating cost quality capability and sourcing issue experienced by third party provider can also adversely affect our cost margin rate and the quality and effectiveness of our product and service and result in liability and reputational harm ge form risk factor financial risksfinancial risk relates to our ability to meet financial obligation and mitigate exposure to broad market risk including volatility in foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate and commodity price funding and liquidity risk including risk related to our credit rating and our availability and cost of funding and credit risk liquidity risk refers to the potential inability to meet contractual or contingent financial obligation whether on or off balance sheet they arise and could potentially impact an institution financial condition or overall safety and soundness credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from customer or counterparty failure to meet it contractual obligation and we face credit risk arising from both our industrial business and from ge capital funding liquidity failure to maintain our credit rating or condition in the financial and credit market could adversely affect our access to capital market funding cost and related margin liquidity capital allocation plan and competitive position we rely on cash from operation and proceeds from planned disposition well access to the short and long term debt market to fund our operation maintain liquidity and meet our financial obligation and capital allocation priority in particular we rely on significant short term borrowing in the commercial paper market to fund our operation on an intra quarter basis if we do not meet our cash flow objective whether through improved cash performance in our business or result of planned disposition our financial condition could be adversely affected our access to the debt market and to the commercial paper market tier issuer in particular depends on our credit rating for additional discussion about our current credit rating refer to the financial resource and liquidity debt and derivative instrument guarantee and covenant credit rating section there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit rating failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of fund and related margin liquidity competitive position and potentially access to capital market for example downgrade of our credit rating causing loss of tier commercial paper issuer status would reduce our borrowing capacity in the commercial paper market and such downgrade could require to draw on operating credit line or take other action that increase our cost of fund to replace intra quarter funding and liquidity significant increase in our cost of capital could require change to our capital allocation plan in addition under various debt and derivative instrument guarantee and covenant we could be required to post additional capital or collateral in the event of rating downgrade which would increase the impact of rating downgrade on our liquidity and capital position external condition in the financial and credit market may also limit the availability of funding at particular time or increase the cost of funding which could adversely affect our business financial position and result of operation factor that may affect the availability of funding or cause an increase in our funding cost include disruption in the commercial paper market and potential market impact arising in the united state europe or china from development in sovereign debt situation currency movement or other potential market disruption if ge or ge capital cost of funding were to increase it may adversely affect our competitive position and result in lower net interest margin earnings and cash flow well lower return on shareowner equity and invested capital economy counterparties deterioration in condition in the global economy the major industry we serve or the financial market or in the soundness of financial institution government or customer we deal with may adversely affect our business and result of operation the business and operating result of our industrial business have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic condition including condition in the air and rail transportation power generation oil and gas renewables healthcare and other major industry we serve existing or potential customer may delay or cancel plan to purchase our product and service including large infrastructure project and may not be able to fulfill their obligation to in timely fashion result of business deterioration cash flow shortage low oil price or difficulty obtaining financing due to geopolitical disruption change in law or other unexpected challenge affecting the strength of the global economy the airline industry for example is highly cyclical and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the and international economy an extended disruption of regional or international travel that result in the loss of business and leisure traffic could have material adverse effect on our airline customer and the viability of their business service contract cancellation or customer dynamic such early aircraft retirement reduced demand in our power business result of increased market penetration by renewables reduced demand in the wind energy market from the elimination of production tax credit for new wind project or decline in order project commencement delay and pricing pressure at baker hughes ge company from low oil price could affect our ability to fully recover our contract cost and estimated earnings further our vendor may experience similar condition which may impact their ability to fulfill their obligation to we may also face greater challenge collecting on receivables with customer that are sovereign government or located in emerging market if there is significant deterioration in the global economy our result of operation financial position and cash flow could be materially adversely affected ge form risk factor ge capital smaller ge capital continues to have exposure to credit and other risk and in the event of future adverse development may not be able to meet it business and financial objective without taking further action at ge capital or capital contribution by ge to fund the statutory capital contribution that it expects to make to it run off insurance operation over the next several year well to meet it other obligation ge capital plan to rely on it existing liquidity and generate additional cash through sale or other portfolio action including reducing the size of it energy financial service and industrial finance business however ge capital excess liquidity from past disposition proceeds run off and future earnings are reduced result of business or other asset sale the risk will increase that future adverse development could cause liquidity or funding stress for ge capital for example it is possible that future requirement for capital contribution to the insurance operation will be greater than currently estimated or that contingent liability from ge capital continuing or discontinued operation including the wmc matter described in the legal proceeding risk factor below will need to be recognized in the future and will become payable which would increase the likelihood of ge capital facing liquidity or funding stress in meeting those and it other obligation if ge capital is unable to increase it capital level over time it may also face credit rating downgrade that increase it interest cost or limit it ability to access to external funding in the future moreover ge capital ha exposure to many different industry and counterparties including sovereign government and routinely executes transaction with counterparties in the financial service industry including broker and dealer commercial bank investment bank and other institutional client many of these transaction expose ge capital to credit risk in the event of default of it counterparty or client if condition in the financial market deteriorate they may adversely affect the business and result of operation of ge capital well the soundness of financial institution government and other counterparties we deal with in addition ge capital credit risk may be increased when the value of collateral held can not be realized through sale or is liquidated at price insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to it there can be no assurance that future liability loss or impairment to the carrying value of financial asset would not materially and adversely affect ge capital business financial position result of operation and capacity to provide financing to support order from ge industrial business or that factor causing sufficiently severe stress at ge capital would not require ge to make capital contribution to ge capital in the future social cost sustained increase in pension and healthcare benefit cost may reduce our profitability our result of operation may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit pension plan gaap requires that we calculate income or expense for the plan using actuarial valuation these valuation reflect assumption about financial market and other economic condition which may change based on change in key economic indicator the most significant year end assumption we use to estimate pension expense for are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on the plan asset in addition we are required to make an annual measurement of plan asset and liability which may result in significant reduction or increase to equity at the end of the ge pension plan wa underfunded on gaap basis by billion and the ge supplementary pension plan an unfunded plan had projected benefit obligation of billion although gaap expense and pension funding contribution are not directly related key economic factor that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would contribute to pension plan required under the employee retirement income security act erisa failure to achieve expected return on plan asset driven by various factor which could include continued environment of low interest rate or sustained market volatility could also result in an increase to the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plan in addition there may be upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare benefit to current employee and retiree although we have actively sought to control increase in these cost there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increase and continued upward pressure could reduce our profitability for discussion regarding how our financial statement can be affected by our pension and healthcare benefit obligation see the other consolidated information postretirement benefit plan section and note to the consolidated financial statement see also the critical accounting estimate pension

area of significance for our business that and non government have focused and continue to focus on include competition law improper payment data privacy and sovereignty foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility currency control that could restrict the movement of liquidity from particular jurisdiction trade control or tariff on import and export in the or other country complex economic sanction and the enactment of tax reform and potential further change to tax law may have an effect on ge ge capital or other regulated subsidiary structure operation sale liquidity capital requirement effective tax rate and performance for example legislative or regulatory measure by state or non government in response to the recent federal tax reform or otherwise or rule and interpretation under the new tax law could increase our cost or tax rate in addition effort by public and private sector to control the growth of healthcare cost may lead to lower reimbursement and increased utilization control related to the use of our product by healthcare provider regulation or government scrutiny may impact the requirement for marketing our product and slow our ability to introduce new product resulting in an adverse impact on our business furthermore we have been and expect to continue participating in and international governmental program which require to comply

virtually every part of the world including the matter described in the legal proceeding and environmental matter section we our representative and the industry in which we operate are subject to continuing scrutiny by regulator other governmental authority and private sector entity or individual in the the european union and other jurisdiction which may in certain circumstance lead to enforcement action adverse change to our business practice fine and penalty required remedial action such contaminated site clean up or the assertion of private litigation claim such class action based on alleged security law violation or breach of fiduciary duty and damage that could be material for example in connection with our acquisition of alstom thermal renewables and grid business in november we are subject to legacy legal proceeding and legal compliance risk that relate to claimed anti competitive conduct or improper payment by alstom in the pre acquisition period in addition our discontinued mortgage business wmc is defendant in civil litigation arising out of it origination and sale of mortgage from through and discussed in the legal proceeding section we believe that the department of justice is likely to assert that wmc and ge capital violated the financial institution reform recovery and enforcement act of firrea in connection with wmc origination and sale of subprime mortgage loan in and we have established reserve for these and other legal matter when and appropriate however the estimation of legal reserve or possible loss involves significant judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainty and unpredictable outcome inherent in litigation and investigation and the actual loss arising from particular matter may exceed our current estimate and adversely affect our result of operation while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance program the global and diverse nature of our operation and the current enforcement environment mean that legal and compliance risk will continue to exist with respect to our continuing and discontinued operation and we may also be subject to material trailing legal liability from business that we dispose of or that are inactive we also expect that additional legal proceeding and other contingency the outcome of which can not be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time moreover we are increasingly selling product and service in growth market where claim arising from catastrophic product failure alleged violation of law or other incident involving our product and service may be adjudicated within legal system that are le developed and le reliable than those of the or other more developed market and this can create additional

service only when firm sale agreement is in place delivery ha occurred or service have been rendered and collectability of the fixed or determinable sale price is reasonably assured arrangement for the sale of good and service sometimes include multiple component most of our multiple component arrangement involve the sale of good and service in the healthcare segment our arrangement with multiple component usually involve an upfront deliverable of large machinery or equipment and future service deliverable such installation commissioning training or the future delivery of ancillary product in most case the relative value of the undelivered component are not significant to the overall arrangement and are typically delivered within three to six month after the core product ha been delivered in such agreement selling price is determined for each component and any difference between the total of the separate selling price and total contract consideration discount is allocated pro rata across each of the component in the arrangement the value assigned to each component is objectively determined and obtained primarily from source such the separate selling price for that or similar item or from competitor price for similar item if such evidence is not available we use our best estimate of selling price which is established consistent with the pricing strategy of the business and considers product configuration geography customer type and other market specific factor except for good sold under long term agreement we recognize sale of good under the provision of security and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition in arrangement where we sell product that provide the customer with right of return we use our accumulated experience to estimate and provide for such return when we record the sale in situation where arrangement include customer acceptance provision based on seller or customer specified objective criterion we recognize revenue when we have reliably demonstrated that all specified acceptance criterion have been met or when formal acceptance occurs respectively in arrangement where we provide good for trial and evaluation purpose we only recognize revenue after customer acceptance occurs unless otherwise noted we do not provide for anticipated loss before we record sale we recognize revenue on agreement for sale of good and service under power generation unit and uprate contract nuclear fuel assembly larger oil drilling equipment project aeroderivative unit contract military

locomotive production contract we recognize sale we complete major contract specified deliverable most often when customer receive title to the good or accept the service performed for larger oil drilling equipment project and long term construction project we recognize sale based on our progress toward contract completion measured by actual cost incurred in relation to our estimate of total expected cost we measure long term contract revenue by applying our contract specific estimated margin rate to incurred cost we routinely update our estimate of future cost for agreement in process and report any cumulative effect of such adjustment in current operation we provide for any loss that we expect to incur on these agreement when that loss is probable we recognize revenue upon delivery for sale of aircraft engine and military propulsion equipment delivery of commercial aircraft engine and non military equipment occurs on shipment delivery of military propulsion equipment sold to the government or agency thereof occurs upon receipt of material inspection and receiving report dd form or memorandum of shipment commercial aircraft engine are complex equipment manufactured to customer order under variety of sometimes complex long term agreement we measure sale of commercial aircraft engine by applying our contract specific estimated margin rate to incurred cost we routinely update our estimate of future revenue and cost for commercial aircraft engine agreement in process and report any cumulative effect of such adjustment in current operation significant component of our revenue and cost estimate include price concession and performance related guarantee well material labor and overhead cost we measure revenue for military propulsion equipment and spare part not subject to long term product service agreement based on the specific contract on specifically measured output basis we provide for any loss that we expect to incur on these agreement when that loss is probable consistent with industry practice for commercial aircraft engine we make such provision only if such loss are not recoverable from future highly probable sale of spare part and service for those engine ge form financial statementspresentation policy we sell product service under long term product maintenance or extended warranty agreement in our aviation power oil gas and transportation segment where cost of performing service are incurred on other than straight line basis we also sell similar long term product service in our healthcare and renewable energy segment where such cost generally are expected to be incurred on straight line basis for the aviation power oil gas and transportation agreement we recognize related sale based on the extent of our progress toward completion measured by actual cost incurred in relation to total expected cost we routinely update our estimate of future cost for agreement in process and report any cumulative effect of such adjustment in current operation for the healthcare and renewable energy agreement we recognize revenue on straight line basis and expense related cost incurred we provide for any loss that we expect to incur on any of these agreement when that loss is probable ge capital revenue from service earned income we use the interest method to recognize income on loan interest on loan includes origination commitment and other non refundable fee related to funding recorded in earned income on the interest method we stop accruing interest at the earlier of the time at which collection of an account becomes doubtful or the account becomes day past due previously recognized interest income that wa accrued but not collected from the borrower is reversed unless the term of the loan agreement permit capitalization of accrued interest to the principal balance payment received on nonaccrual loan are applied to reduce the principal balance of the loan we resume accruing interest on nonaccrual non restructured loan only when payment are brought current according to the loan original term and future payment are reasonably assured when we agree to restructured term with the borrower we resume accruing interest only when it is reasonably assured that we will recover full contractual payment and such loan pas underwriting review equivalent to those applied to new loan we recognize financing lease income on the interest method to produce level yield on fund not yet recovered estimated unguaranteed residual value are based upon management best estimate of the value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term we use various source of data in determining these estimate including information obtained from third party which is adjusted for the attribute of the specific asset under lease guarantee of residual value by unrelated third party are included within minimum lease payment significant assumption we use in estimating residual value include estimated net cash flow over the remaining lease term anticipated result of future remarketing and estimated future component part and scrap metal price discounted at an appropriate rate we recognize operating lease income on straight line basis over the term of underlying lease business and asset held for salebusinesses and asset held for sale represent component that meet accounting requirement to be classified held for sale and are presented single asset and liability amount in our financial statement with valuation allowance if necessary to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fair value le cost to sell financing receivables that no longer qualify to be presented held for investment must be classified asset held for sale and recognized in our financial statement at the lower of cost or fair value le cost to sell with that amount representing new cost basis at the date of transfer the determination of fair value for business and asset held for sale involves significant judgment and assumption development of estimate of fair value in this circumstance is complex and is dependent upon among other factor the nature of the potential sale transaction for example asset sale versus sale of legal entity composition of asset and or business in the disposal group the comparability of the disposal group to market transaction and negotiation with third party purchaser such factor bear directly on the range of potential fair value and the selection of the best estimate key assumption were developed based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participant would use in hypothetical transaction we review all business and asset held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amount are fully recoverable in comparison to estimated fair value le cost to sell depreciation and amortizationthe cost of ge manufacturing plant and equipment is generally depreciated on straight line basis over it estimated economic life the cost of ge capital equipment leased to others on operating lease is depreciated on straight line basis to estimated residual value over the lease term or over the estimated economic life of the equipment ge form financial statementspresentation policy loss on financing receivablesour financing receivables portfolio consists of variety of loan and lease including both larger balance non homogeneous loan and lease and smaller balance homogeneous loan and lease we routinely evaluate our entire portfolio for potential specific credit or collection issue that might indicate an impairment loss on financing receivables are recognized when they are incurred which requires to make our best estimate of probable loss inherent in the portfolio the method for calculating the best estimate of loss depends on the size type and risk characteristic of the related financing receivable such an estimate requires consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current condition and judgment about the probable effect of relevant observable data including present economic condition such delinquency rate financial health of specific customer and market sector collateral value and the present and expected future level of interest rate the underlying assumption estimate and assessment we use to provide for loss are updated periodically to reflect our view of current condition change in such estimate can significantly affect the allowance and provision for loss it is possible that we will experience credit loss that are different from our current estimate write offs are deducted from the allowance for loss when we judge the principal to be uncollectible and subsequent recovery are added to the allowance at the time cash is received on written off account partial sale of business interestsgains or loss on sale of affiliate share where we retain controlling financial interest are recorded in equity gain or loss on sale that result in our loss of controlling financial interest are recorded in earnings along with remeasurement gain or loss on any investment in the entity that we retained cash and

investment securitieswe report investment in debt and marketable equity security and certain other equity security at fair value see note for further information on fair value unrealized gain and loss on available for sale investment security are included in shareowner equity net of applicable tax and other adjustment we regularly review investment security for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criterion for debt security if we do not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost we evaluate other qualitative criterion to determine whether we do not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the security such the financial health of and specific prospect for the issuer including whether the issuer is in compliance with the term and covenant of the security we also evaluate quantitative criterion including determining whether there ha been an adverse change in expected future cash flow if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security we consider the security to be other than temporarily impaired otti and we record the difference between the security amortized cost basis and it recoverable amount in earnings and the difference between the security recoverable amount and fair value in other comprehensive income if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of it amortized cost basis the security is also considered otti and we recognize the entire difference between the security amortized cost basis and it fair value in earnings for equity security we consider the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security we consider the security to be otti and we record the difference between the security amortized cost basis and it fair value in earnings realized gain and loss are accounted for on the specific identification method unrealized gain and loss on investment security classified trading are included

assetswe do not amortize goodwill but test it at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level reporting unit is the operating segment or one level below that operating segment the component level if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management however component are aggregated single reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristic we recognize an impairment charge if the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds it fair value and the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill we use market approach when available and appropriate or the income approach or combination of both to establish fair value when portion of reporting unit is disposed goodwill is allocated to the gain or loss on disposition based on the relative fair value of the business or business disposed and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained we amortize the cost of other intangible over their estimated useful life unless such life are deemed indefinite the cost of intangible asset is generally amortized on straight line basis over the asset estimated economic life except that individually significant customer related intangible asset are amortized in relation to total related sale amortizable intangible asset are reviewed for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable in these circumstance they are tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flow and if impaired written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flow or appraised value intangible asset with indefinite life are tested annually for impairment and written down to fair value required investment contract insurance liability and insurance annuity benefitsour run off insurance operation include providing insurance and reinsurance for life and health risk and providing certain annuity product primary product type include long term care structured settlement annuity life and disability insurance contract and investment contract insurance contract are contract with significant mortality and or morbidity risk while investment contract are contract without such risk for traditional long duration insurance contract we report premium revenue when due premium received on non traditional long duration insurance contract and investment contract including annuity without significant mortality risk are not reported revenue but rather deposit liability we recognize revenue for charge and assessment on these contract mostly for mortality contract initiation administration and surrender amount credited to policyholder account are charged to expense liability for traditional long duration insurance contract includes both future policy benefit reserve and claim reserve future policy benefit reserve represent the present value of future policy benefit le the present value of future net premium and were first established based on actuarial assumption at the time the policy were issued or acquired plus margin for adverse deviation these assumption include but are not limited to interest rate health care experience including type and cost of care morbidity mortality the length of time policy will remain in force and anticipated future premium increase from future

and estimated claim settlement expense represent our best estimate of the ultimate obligation for reported and incurred but not reported claim and the related estimated claim settlement expense liability for unpaid claim and estimated claim settlement expense are evaluated periodically for potential change in loss estimate with the support of qualified actuary and any change are recorded in the period in which they are determined key input include actual known fact about the claim such the benefit available and cause of disability of the claimant well assumption derived from our actual historical experience and expected future change in experience factor fair value measurement the following section describe the valuation methodology we use to measure financial and non financial instrument accounted for at fair value including certain asset within our pension plan and retiree benefit plan for financial asset and liability measured at fair value on recurring basis fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer liability in an orderly transaction with market participant at the measurement date in the absence of active market for the identical asset or liability such measurement involve developing assumption based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participant would use in hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date ge form financial statementspresentation policy observable input reflect market data obtained from independent source while unobservable input reflect our market assumption preference is given to observable input these two type of input create the following fair value hierarchy level quoted price for identical instrument in active market level quoted price for similar instrument in active market quoted price for identical or similar instrument in market that are not active and model derived valuation whose input are observable or whose significant value driver are observable level significant input to the valuation model are unobservable we maintain policy and procedure to value instrument using the best and most relevant data available in addition we have risk management team that review valuation including independent price validation for certain instrument with regard to level valuation including instrument valued by third party we perform variety of procedure to ass the reasonableness of the valuation such review include an evaluation of instrument whose fair value change exceeds predefined threshold and or doe not change and consider the current interest rate currency and credit environment well other published data such rating agency market report and current appraisal this detailed review may include the use of third party valuation firm recurring fair value measurementsthe following section describe the valuation methodology we use to measure different financial instrument at fair value on recurring basis investment in debt and equity security when available we use quoted market price to determine the fair value of investment security and they are included in level level security primarily include publicly traded equity security for large number of investment security for which market price are observable for identical or similar investment security but not readily accessible for each of those investment individually that is it is difficult to obtain pricing information for each individual investment security at the measurement date we obtain pricing information from an independent pricing vendor the pricing vendor us various pricing model for each asset class that are consistent with what other market participant would use the input and assumption to the model of the pricing vendor are derived from market observable source including benchmark yield reported trade broker dealer quote issuer spread benchmark security bid offer and other market related data since many fixed income security do not trade on daily basis the methodology of the pricing vendor us available information applicable such benchmark curve benchmarking of like security sector grouping and matrix pricing the pricing vendor considers available market observable input in determining the evaluation for security thus certain security may not be priced using quoted price but rather determined from market observable information these investment are included in level and primarily comprise our portfolio of corporate fixed income and government mortgage and asset backed security in infrequent circumstance our pricing vendor may provide with valuation that are based on significant unobservable input and in those circumstance we classify the investment security in level annually we conduct review of our primary pricing vendor to validate that the input used in that vendor pricing process are deemed to be market observable defined in the standard while we are not provided access to proprietary model of the vendor our review have included on site walk throughs of the pricing process methodology and control procedure for each asset class and level for which price are provided our review also include an examination of the underlying input and assumption for sample of individual security across asset class credit rating level and various duration in addition the pricing vendor ha an established challenge process in place for all security valuation which facilitates identification and resolution of potentially erroneous price we believe that the price received from our pricing vendor are representative of price that would be received to sell the asset at the measurement date exit price and are classified appropriately in the hierarchy we use non binding broker quote and other third party pricing service our primary basis for valuation when there is limited or no relevant market activity for specific instrument or for other instrument that share similar characteristic we have not adjusted the price we have obtained investment security priced using non binding broker quote and other third party pricing service are included in level is the case with our primary pricing vendor third party broker and other third party pricing service do not provide access to their proprietary valuation model input and assumption accordingly we conduct review of vendor applicable similar to the review performed of our primary pricing vendor in addition we conduct internal review of pricing for all such investment security quarterly to ensure reasonableness of valuation used in our financial statement these review are designed to identify price that appear stale those that have changed significantly from prior valuation and other anomaly that may indicate that price may not be accurate based on the information available we believe that the fair value provided by the broker and other third party pricing service are representative of price that would be received to sell the asset at the measurement date exit price ge form financial statementspresentation policy derivative we use closing price for derivative included in level which are traded either on exchange or liquid over the counter market the majority of our derivative are valued using internal model the model maximize the use of market observable input including interest rate curve and both forward and spot price for currency and commodity derivative asset and liability included in level primarily represent interest rate swap cross currency swap and foreign currency and commodity forward and option contract derivative asset and liability included in level primarily represent equity derivative and interest rate product that contain embedded optionality or prepayment feature nonrecurring fair value measurementscertain asset are measured at fair value on nonrecurring basis these asset are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustment only in certain circumstance these asset can include loan and long lived asset that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale impaired loan that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral cost and equity method investment and long lived asset that are written down to fair value when they are impaired and the remeasurement of retained investment in formerly consolidated subsidiary upon change in control that result in deconsolidation of subsidiary if we sell controlling interest and retain noncontrolling stake in the entity asset that are written down to fair value when impaired and retained investment are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs the following section describe the valuation methodology we use to measure financial and non financial instrument accounted for at fair value on nonrecurring basis and for certain asset within our pension plan and retiree benefit plan at each reporting period applicable financing receivables and loan held for sale when available we use observable market data including pricing on recent closed market transaction to value loan that are included in level when this data is unobservable we use valuation methodology using current market interest rate data adjusted for inherent credit risk and such loan are included in level when appropriate loan may be valued using collateral value see long lived asset below cost and equity method investment cost and equity method investment are valued using market observable data such quoted price when available when market observable data is unavailable investment are valued using discounted cash flow model comparative market multiple or combination of both approach appropriate and other third party pricing source these investment are generally included in level investment in private equity real estate and collective fund held within our pension plan are generally valued using the net asset value nav per share practical expedient for fair value provided certain criterion are met the navs are determined based on the fair value of the underlying investment in the fund on january we adopted guidance whereby investment that are measured at fair value using the nav practical expedient are no longer classified in the fair value hierarchy long lived asset fair value of long lived asset including aircraft are primarily derived internally and are based on observed sale transaction for similar asset in other instance for example collateral type for which we do not have comparable observed sale transaction data collateral value are developed internally and corroborated by external appraisal information adjustment to third party valuation may be performed in circumstance where market comparables are not specific to the attribute of the specific collateral or appraisal information may not be reflective of current market condition due to the passage of time and the occurrence of market event since receipt of the information retained investment in formerly consolidated subsidiary upon change in control that result in deconsolidation of subsidiary the fair value measurement of our retained noncontrolling stake is valued using market observable data such quoted price when available or if not available an income approach market approach or combination of both approach appropriate in applying these methodology we rely on number of factor including actual operating result future business plan economic projection market observable pricing multiple of similar business and comparable transaction and possible control premium these investment are generally included in level or level appropriate determined at the time of the transaction ge form financial statementspresentation policy accounting changeson january we will adopt accounting standard update asu revenue from contract with customer and the related amendment which will supersede most existing gaap revenue guidance we will adopt the new asu on retrospective basis resulting in consistent basis of presentation within our consolidated financial statement for all period presented the new asu will have material effect on our historically reported consolidated financial statement well our existing process to recognize revenue upon adoption we will record billion non cash charge to our january retained earnings to reflect the change in timing in the recognition of revenue and certain cost primarily within our power and aviation business the new asu also requires incremental disclosure including the amount of revenue allocated to remaining performance obligation for existing customer contract while the remaining performance obligation disclosure is similar in concept to our reported backlog the new asu definition excludes revenue from contract that provide the customer with the right to cancel or terminate for convenience even if our historical experience indicates the likelihood of cancellation or termination is remote result we anticipate the remaining performance obligation disclosure will be significantly lower than our historically reported backlog on september we adopted asu improvement to employee share based payment accounting which wa intended to simplify several aspect of the accounting for employee share based payment transaction including the accounting for income tax forfeiture and statutory tax withholding requirement well classification in the statement of cash flow we adopted the standard on prospective basis with the effect of adoption reflected for the interim period after the year beginning january required by the standard the primary effect of adoption were the recognition of excess tax benefit in our provision for income tax rather than paid in capital and the reclassification of cash flow related to excess tax benefit from financing activity to operating activity for the period beginning january we will continue to estimate the number of award that are expected to vest in our determination of the related periodic compensation cost result of the adoption our provision for income tax decreased by million for the nine month ended september for the excess tax benefit related to share based payment in it provision for income tax application of the cash flow presentation requirement from january resulted in an increase to cash from operating activity and decrease to cash from financing activity of million for the nine month ended september on january we adopted asu simplifying the accounting for measurement period adjustment which eliminated the requirement for an acquirer in business combination to account for measurement period adjustment retrospectively see note for further discussion of the purchase accounting effect of recent acquisition on january we adopted asu simplifying the presentation of debt issuance cost which requires that debt issuance cost related to recognized debt liability to be presented on the balance sheet direct deduction from the debt liability similar to the presentation of debt premium and discount asu applies retrospectively and doe not change the recognition and measurement requirement for debt issuance cost the adoption of asu resulted in the reclassification of million of unamortized debt issuance cost related to the company borrowing from all other asset to short term and long term borrowing within our consolidated balance sheet of december on january we adopted asu amendment to the consolidation analysis the asu amended the consolidation guidance for vies and general partner investment in limited partnership and modified the evaluation of whether limited partnership and similar legal entity are vies or voting interest entity upon adoption we deconsolidated three investment fund managed by ge asset management geam that had been accounted for under the guidance prior to the issuance of asu improvement to financial reporting by enterprise involved with variable interest entity by virtue of the deferral provided by asu amendment for certain investment fund we concluded that geam management contract were no longer variable interest in the three investment fund and therefore continued consolidation wa not appropriate we deconsolidated net asset and noncontrolling interest of million respectively in addition many

of weaker dollar partially offset by the reclassification of various business to asset of business held for sale and impairment of our energy financial service and power conversion goodwill goodwill balance increased million in primarily result of the alstom acquisition purchase accounting adjustment and other acquisition partially offset by currency exchange effect of the stronger dollar against other major currency ge form financial statementsacquisitions intangible asset we test goodwill for impairment annually in the third quarter of each year using data of july of that year the impairment test consists of two step in step one the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared with it fair value in step two which is applied when the carrying value is more than it fair value the amount of goodwill impairment if any is derived by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit asset and liability from the fair value of it equity and comparing that amount with the carrying amount of goodwill we determined fair value for each of the reporting unit using the market approach when available and appropriate or the income approach or combination of both we ass the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation if multiple valuation methodology are used the result are weighted appropriately valuation using the market approach are derived from metric of publicly traded company or historically completed transaction of comparable business the selection of comparable business is based on the market in which the reporting unit operate giving consideration to risk profile size geography and diversity of product and service market approach is limited to reporting unit for which there are publicly traded company that have the characteristic similar to our business under the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flow discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted rate we use our internal forecast to estimate future cash flow and include an estimate of long term future growth rate based on our most recent view of the long term outlook for each business actual result may differ from those assumed in our forecast we derive our discount rate using capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rate for industry relevant to our reporting unit to estimate the cost of equity financing we use discount rate that are commensurate with the risk and uncertainty inherent in the respective business and in our internally developed forecast discount rate used in our reporting unit valuation ranged from to during the third quarter of we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill for all our reporting unit based on the result of our step one testing the fair value of each of the ge reporting unit exceeded their carrying value except for our power conversion reporting unit within our power operating segment the primary factor contributing to reduction in fair value of this reporting unit were extended downturn in certain of it customer segment most notably the marine and oil and gas market increased pricing and cost pressure in low margin renewable market and the delayed introduction of new technology and product therefore we performed step two analysis result of this analysis we recognized non cash goodwill impairment loss of million during the third quarter to write down the carrying value of power conversion goodwill to it implied fair value due to the impairment taken in the third quarter we performed an interim impairment test of our power conversion reporting unit in the fourth quarter of which indicated that it carrying value wa greater than it fair value therefore we performed step two analysis which resulted in the impairment of the remaining reporting unit goodwill the primary factor contributing to the further decline in the fair value of the power conversion reporting unit in the fourth quarter were increased competition leading to loss and cancellation of order in the renewables customer segment and further downturn in oil and gas in addition power conversion reached an agreement to sell it low voltage motor business which decreased the fair value of the remaining power conversion reporting unit result we recognized an additional non cash impairment loss of million during the fourth quarter the total impairment loss of million of the power conversion goodwill wa recorded on the statement of earnings loss to other cost and expense after the impairment loss there is no goodwill in our power conversion reporting unit in addition we identified one reporting unit for which the fair value wa not substantially in excess of it carrying value the grid solution reporting unit within our power operating segment wa formed result of the alstom acquisition in november since fair value equaled carrying value at the time of acquisition this caused the fair value of this reporting unit not to be significantly in excess of it carrying value in the current annual impairment test the fair value of grid solution continued to be not substantially in excess of carrying value therefore we performed an interim impairment test in the fourth quarter of which resulted in the fair value being in excess of it carrying value by approximately while the goodwill of this reporting unit is not currently impaired there could be an impairment in the future result of change in certain assumption for example the fair value could be adversely affected and result in an impairment of goodwill if expected synergy of the acquisition with alstom are not realized or if the reporting unit wa not able to execute on customer opportunity the estimated cash flow are discounted at higher risk adjusted rate or market multiple decrease the goodwill associated with our grid solution reporting unit wa million representing approximately of our total goodwill at december due to the overall decline in the power market we performed an interim step one analysis of our power generation reporting unit within our power segment which indicated that it fair value ha declined since our last impairment test however wa still significantly in excess of it carrying value we will continue to monitor the power market and the impact it may have on this reporting unit ge form financial statementsacquisitions intangible asset due to the strategic shift to make our capital segment smaller and more focused we determined we had an impairment trigger at our energy financial service reporting unit in the fourth quarter of and performed step one analysis which indicated that it carrying value wa in excess of it fair value the primary factor contributing to reduction in fair value of this reporting unit is the change in strategy of long term growth to partial exit of earning asset and restriction on ability to originate new volume this result in lower forecasted future cash flow and long term growth assumption based upon the result of the step one analysis we performed the second step of the impairment test which indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill wa zero therefore we recorded non cash impairment loss on the statement of earnings loss to other cost and expense of million during the fourth quarter to fully impair the goodwill at our energy financial service reporting unit while the fair value of our oil gas reporting unit are in excess of their carrying value the oilfield equipment and oilfield service reporting unit continued to experience decline in order project commencement delay and pricing pressure which reduced it fair value in the annual impairment test we will continue to monitor the oil gas industry and the impact it may have on this reporting unit in addition because of the baker hughes acquisition and related integration activity the composition of our historical reporting unit for the oil gas operating segment may change in the event that any of our reporting unit change substantially we will be required to re test the reporting unit of the date of the reorganization re allocate goodwill based on the relative fair value of the new reporting unit and record any required impairment finally the operating and reporting segment and associated reporting unit for bhge reported in their standalone financial statement are different than ge bhge is subsidiary and performs it reporting unit assessment one level below it operating segment of december we believe no other goodwill impairment exists apart from the impairment charge discussed above and that the remaining goodwill is recoverable for all of our reporting unit however there can be no assurance that additional goodwill will not be impaired in future period estimating the fair value of reporting unit requires the use of estimate and significant judgment that are based on number of factor including actual operating result it is reasonably possible that the judgment and estimate described above could change in future period other intangible asset other intangible asset net december in million intangible

ordinary course of business lending commitment revolving credit excluded investment commitment of million and million at december and december respectively derivative and hedging form of hedging in this section we explain the hedging method we use and their effect on our financial statement cash flow hedge we use cash flow hedging primarily to reduce or eliminate the effect of foreign exchange rate change on purchase and sale contract in our industrial business and to convert foreign currency debt that we have issued in our financial service business back to our functional currency under hedge accounting the derivative carrying amount is measured at fair value each period and any resulting gain or loss is recorded in separate component of shareowner equity difference between the derivative and the hedged item may cause change in their fair value to not offset completely which is referred to ineffectiveness when the hedged transaction occurs these amount are released from shareowner equity in order that the transaction will be reflected in earnings at the rate locked in by the derivative the effect of the hedge is reported in the same financial statement line item the earnings effect of the hedged transaction part of our ongoing effort to reduce borrowing we may repurchase debt that wa in cash flow hedge accounting relationship at the time of determining that the debt cash flow are probable of not occurring any related oci will be released to earnings the following table explains the effect of change in market rate on the fair value of derivative we use most commonly in cash flow hedging arrangement interest rate forward swapsinterest rate increasesinterest rate decreasespay fixed rate receive floating ratefair value increasesfair value decrease currency

fixed pricefair value increasesfair value decreasesfair value hedge these derivative are used to hedge the effect of interest rate and currency exchange rate change on debt that we have issued under hedge accounting the derivative is measured at fair value and the carrying amount of the hedged debt is adjusted for the change in value related to the exposure being hedged with both adjustment offset to earnings interest expense for example the earnings effect of an increase in the fair value of the derivative will be largely offset by the earnings effect of an increase in the carrying amount of the hedged debt difference between the term of the derivative and the hedged debt may cause change in their fair value to not offset completely which is referred to ineffectiveness the effect of change in market interest rate on the fair value of derivative we use most commonly in fair value hedging arrangement is presented below interest rate forward swapsinterest rate increasesinterest rate decreasespay floating rate receive fixed ratefair value decreasesfair value increasesnet investment hedge we invest in foreign operation that conduct their financial service activity in currency other than the dollar we hedge the currency risk associated with those investment primarily using non derivative instrument such debt denominated in foreign currency and short term currency exchange contract under which we receive dollar and pay foreign currency ge form financial statementsfinancial instrument under hedge accounting the portion of the fair value change of the derivative or debt instrument that relates to change in spot currency exchange rate is offset in separate component of shareowner equity for example an increase in the fair value of the derivative related to change in spot exchange rate will be offset by corresponding increase in the currency translation component of shareowner equity the portion of the fair value change of the derivative related to difference between spot and forward rate which primarily relates to the interest component is recorded in earnings each period interest expense result of this hedging strategy the investment in foreign operation of our financial service business are largely unaffected by change in currency exchange rate the amount recorded in shareowner equity only affect earnings if the hedged investment is sold substantially liquidated or control is lost the effect of change in currency exchange rate on the fair value of derivative we use in net investment hedging arrangement is presented below currency forward swapsu dollar strengthensu dollar weakensreceive dollar pay foreign currencyfair value increasesfair value decreaseseconomic hedge these derivative are not designated hedge from an accounting standpoint and therefore we do not apply hedge accounting to the relationship but otherwise serve the same economic purpose other hedging arrangement we use economic hedge when we have exposure to currency exchange risk for which we are unable to meet the requirement for hedge accounting or when change in the carrying amount of the hedged item are already recorded in earnings in the same period the derivative making hedge accounting unnecessary even though the derivative is an effective economic hedge there may be net effect on earnings in each period due to difference in the timing of earnings recognition between the derivative and the hedged item these derivative are marked to fair value through earnings each period for our financial service business these gain and loss are reported in ge capital revenue from service for our industrial business the effect are reported in other income or other cost and expense the offsetting earnings effect associated with hedged asset and liability are also displayed in the table below in general the earnings effect of the hedged item are recorded in the same financial statement line the derivative the earnings effect of economic hedge after considering offset related to earnings effect of hedged asset and liability is substantially offset by change in the fair value of forecasted transaction that have not yet affected earnings the table below explains the effect of market rate change on the fair value of derivative we use most commonly economic hedge interest rate forward swap interest rateinterest rate

the debt in an interest rate swap the notional amount is used to compute interest or other payment stream to be made under the contract and is measure of our level of activity we generally disclose derivative notional amount on gross basis the majority of the outstanding notional amount of billion at december is related to managing interest rate and currency risk between financial asset and liability in our financial service business the remaining derivative notional amount primarily relates to hedge of anticipated sale and purchase in foreign currency commodity purchase and contractual

earnings all derivative are marked to fair value on our balance sheet whether they are designated in hedging relationship for accounting purpose or are used economic hedge discussed in the previous section each type of hedge affect the financial statement differently in fair value and economic hedge both the hedged item and the hedging derivative largely offset in earnings each period in cash

measurement of ineffectiveness were insignificant for each reporting period ge form financial statementsfinancial instrument counterparty credit risk fair value of our derivative can change significantly from period to period based on among other factor market movement and change in our position we manage counterparty credit risk the risk that counterparties will default and not make payment to according to the term of our agreement on an individual counterparty basis where we have agreed to netting of derivative exposure with counterparty we net our exposure with that counterparty and apply the value of collateral posted to to determine the exposure we actively monitor these net exposure against defined limit and take appropriate action in response including requiring additional collateral discussed above we have provision in certain of our master agreement that require counterparties to post collateral typically cash or treasury security when our receivables due from the counterparties measured at current market value exceeds specified limit the fair value of such collateral wa million at december of which million wa cash and million wa in the

wa million at december at december our exposure to counterparties including accrued interest net of collateral we hold wa million this excludes exposure related to embedded derivative additionally our master agreement typically contain mutual downgrade provision that provide the ability of each party to require termination if the long term credit rating of the counterparty were to fall below or other rating level agreed upon with the counterparty in certain of these master agreement each party also ha the ability to require termination if the short term rating of the counterparty were to fall below our master agreement also typically contain provision that provide termination right upon the occurrence of certain other event such bankruptcy or event of default by one of the party if an

sale wmc retained certain representation and warranty obligation related to loan sold to third party prior to the disposal of the business and contractual obligation to repurchase previously sold loan that had an early payment default all claim received by wmc for early payment default have either been resolved or are no longer being pursued the remaining active claim have been brought by securitization trustee or administrator seeking recovery from wmc for alleged breach of representation and warranty on mortgage loan that serve collateral for residential mortgage backed security rmbs at december such claim consisted of million of individual claim generally submitted before the filing of lawsuit compared to million at december and million of additional claim asserted against wmc in litigation without making prior claim litigation claim compared to million at december the total amount of these claim million reflects the purchase price or unpaid principal balance of the loan at the time of purchase and doe not give effect to pay down or potential recovery based upon the underlying collateral which in many case are substantial nor to accrued interest or fee wmc belief that repurchase claim brought based upon representation and warranty made more than six year before wmc wa notified of the claim would be disallowed in legal proceeding under applicable law and the june

were million at december reflecting net decrease to reserve in the year ended december of million due to settlement partially offset by incremental provision the reserve estimate take into account recent settlement activity and is based upon wmc evaluation of the remaining exposure percentage of estimated lifetime mortgage loan loss within the pool of loan supporting each securitization for which timely claim have been asserted in litigation against wmc settlement in prior period reduced wmc exposure on claim asserted in certain securitizations and the claim amount reported above give effect to these settlement rollforward of the reserve in million balance at january resolution rescission balance at december the significant litigation activity and wmc continuing effort to resolve the lawsuit involving claim made against wmc it is difficult to ass whether future loss will be consistent with wmc past experience adverse change to wmc assumption supporting the reserve may result in an increase to these reserve wmc estimate range of reasonably possible loss from to approximately million over it recorded reserve at december this estimate involves significant judgment and may not reflect the range of uncertainty and unpredictable outcome inherent in litigation including the matter discussed in legal proceeding and potential change in wmc legal strategy this estimate excludes any possible loss associated with an adverse court decision on the applicable statute of limitation or an adverse outcome in the department of justice doj ongoing investigation regarding potential violation of the financial institution reform recovery and enforcement act of firrea by wmc and ge capital discussed in legal proceeding we are unable at this time to develop such meaningful estimate with respect to the firrea investigation this inability to develop meaningful estimate of the range of reasonably possible loss reflects among other factor the wide variety and broad range of penalty and other sanction incurred by various financial institution in proceeding and settlement involving claim made under firrea by the doj but loss incurred by wmc and or ge capital resulting from negotiated resolution or an adverse outcome in litigation could be material ge form financial statementscommitments guarantee product warranty and other loss contingenciesat december there were five lawsuit involving claim made against wmc arising from alleged breach of representation and warranty on mortgage loan included in six securitizations the adverse party in these case are securitization trustee or party claiming to act on their behalf discussed in legal proceeding four of these remaining lawsuit have been stayed pending court approval of settlement agreement the sole remaining active lawsuit against wmc is the tmi trust company tmi case and bench trial in that case began on january although the alleged claim for relief vary from case to case the complaint and counterclaim in these action generally assert claim for breach of contract indemnification and or declaratory judgment and seek specific performance repurchase of defective mortgage loan and or money damage adverse court decision including in case not involving wmc could result in new claim and lawsuit on additional loan however wmc continues to believe that it ha defense to the claim asserted in litigation including for example based on causation and materiality requirement and applicable statute of limitation it is not possible to predict the outcome or impact of these defense and other factor any of which could materially affect the amount of any loss ultimately incurred by wmc on these claim wmc ha also received indemnification demand nearly all of which are unspecified from depositor underwriter sponsor of rmbs in connection with lawsuit brought by rmbs investor concerning alleged misrepresentation in the securitization offering document to which wmc is not party or in two case involving mortgage loan repurchase claim made against rmbs sponsor wmc belief that it ha defense to these demand to the extent wmc is required to repurchase loan wmc loss also would be affected by several factor including pay down accrued interest and fee and the value of the underlying collateral the reserve and estimate of possible loss reflect judgment based on currently available information and number of assumption including economic condition claim and settlement activity pending and threatened litigation court decision regarding wmc legal defense indemnification demand government activity and other variable in the mortgage industry actual loss arising from claim against wmc could exceed these amount and additional claim and lawsuit could result if actual claim rate governmental action litigation and indemnification activity adverse court decision actual settlement rate or loss wmc incurs on repurchased loan differ from it assumption adverse development under any of these scenario or finding of liability in the tmi case discussed above could be in an amount exceeding the total value of wmc asset alstom legacy matter on november we acquired the thermal renewables and grid business from

full range of uncertainty and unpredictable outcome inherent in litigation and investigation of this nature damage sought may include disgorgement of profit on the underlying business transaction fine and or penalty interest or other form of resolution factor that can affect the ultimate amount of loss associated with these matter include the way cooperation is assessed and valued prosecutorial discretion in the determination of damage formula for determining fine and penalty the duration and amount of legal and investigative resource applied and political and social influence within each
