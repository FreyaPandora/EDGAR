participant effective january the company account for it defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plan in accordance with accounting standard codification asc compensation retirement benefit in measuring plan asset and benefit obligation and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost asc requires employer to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of defined benefit pension or postretirement plan table of content an asset or liability in it statement of financial position and recognize change in the funded status in the year in which the change occur through accumulated other comprehensive income which is component of stockholder equity while the company belief the valuation method used to determine the fair value of plan asset are appropriate and consistent with other market participant the use of different methodology or assumption to determine the fair value of certain financial instrument could result in different estimate of fair value at the reporting date see note for additional discussion of actuarial assumption used in determining defined benefit pension and postretirement health care liability and expense pension benefit associated with these plan are generally based primarily on each participant year of service compensation and age at retirement or termination the benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefit that employee are entitled to in the future for service already rendered of the measurement date the company measure the present value of these future benefit by projecting benefit payment cash flow for each future period and discounting these cash flow back to the december measurement date using the yield of portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instrument that would produce cash flow sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefit historically the single aggregated discount rate used for each plan benefit obligation wa also used for the calculation of all net periodic benefit cost including the measurement of the service and interest cost beginning in changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost component of the net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost the new method measure service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation service cost are determined based on duration specific spot rate applied to the service cost cash flow the interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration specific spot rate to the year by year projected benefit payment the spot yield curve approach doe not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation the change in service and interest cost offset in the actuarial gain and loss recorded in other comprehensive income the company changed to the new method to provide more precise measure of service and interest cost by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flow and the discrete spot yield curve rate the company accounted for this change change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of using this methodology the company determined discount rate for it plan follow qualified pension international pension weighted average postretirement medical december liability benefit obligation net periodic benefit cost component service cost interest cost another significant element in determining the company pension expense in accordance with asc is the expected return on plan asset which is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan long term capital market return expectation and expected performance from active investment management for the primary qualified pension plan the expected long term rate of return on an annualized basis for is equal to refer to note for information on the rate wa determined return on asset assumption for international pension and other post

or an impairment recorded based on change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group of the billion in net identifiable intangible asset billion relates to indefinite lived tradenames primarily capital safety whose tradenames million at acquisition date have been in existence for over year refer to note for more detail the primary valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible asset tradenames is discounted cash flow approach specifically relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sale with the resulting amount discounted using an appropriate market technology discount rate the relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate market participant would pay to acquire the right to market produce the product if the resulting discounted cash flow are le than the book value of the indefinite lived intangible asset impairment exists and the asset value must be written down based on impairment testing in the third quarter of no impairment wa indicated the discounted cash flow related to the capital safety tradename exceeded it book value by more than percent goodwill totaled approximately billion of december annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year impairment testing for goodwill is done at reporting unit level with all goodwill assigned to reporting unit reporting unit are one level below the business segment level but are required to be combined when reporting unit within the same segment have similar economic characteristic at reporting unit correspond to division not combine any of it reporting unit for impairment testing an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit net asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the loss would equal that difference the estimated fair value of reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by price earnings ratio for comparable industry group or by using discounted cash flow analysis typically us the price earnings ratio approach for stable and growing business that have long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flow us the discounted cash flow approach for start up loss position and declining business in addition to using for business where the price earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted also us discounted cash flow an additional tool for business that may be growing at slower rate than planned due to economic or other condition described in note effective in the first quarter of made business segment reporting change for any product move that resulted in reporting unit change the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting unit during the first quarter of the company completed it assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting unit impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed the discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time of october had primary reporting unit with ten reporting unit accounting for approximately percent of the goodwill these ten reporting unit were comprised of the following division advanced material communication market display material and system health information system industrial adhesive and table of content tape infection prevention oral care solution personal safety separation and purification and transportation safety the estimated fair value for all reporting unit wa in excess of carrying value by approximately percent or more market value at both december and september wa significantly in excess of it shareholder equity of approximately billion discussed in note announced the sale of substantially all of it communication market division which is expected to close in which will result in an associated goodwill reduction of approximately million upon sale in determined fair value using either an industry price earnings ratio approach or discounted cash flow analysis where applicable used weighted average discounted cash flow analysis for certain division using projected cash flow that were weighted based on different sale growth and terminal value assumption among other factor the weighting wa based on management estimate of the likelihood of each scenario occurring is highly integrated enterprise where business share technology and leverage common fundamental strength and capability thus many of business could not easily be sold on stand alone basis focus on research and development ha resulted in portion of value comprised of internally developed business that have no goodwill associated with them based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of no goodwill impairment wa indicated for any of the reporting unit factor which could result in future impairment charge include among others change in worldwide economic condition change in competitive condition and customer preference and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate these risk factor are discussed in item risk factor of this document in addition change in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing result indicated above during the first quarter of the company completed it assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting unit impacted by change between reporting unit and determined that no impairment existed long lived asset with definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset asset group may not be recoverable if future non cash asset impairment charge are taken would expect that portion of the long lived asset or goodwill would be impaired will continue to monitor it reporting unit and asset group in for any triggering event or other indicator of impairment income tax the extent of operation involves dealing with uncertainty and judgment in the application of complex tax regulation in multitude of jurisdiction the final tax paid are dependent upon many factor including negotiation with taxing authority in various jurisdiction and resolution of dispute

standard fair value is defined the exit price or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant of the measurement date the standard also establishes hierarchy for input used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable input and minimizes the use of unobservable input by requiring that the most observable input be used when available observable input are input market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from source independent of the company unobservable input are input that reflect the company assumption about the factor market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstance the hierarchy is broken down into three level level input are quoted price unadjusted in active market for identical asset or liability level input include quoted price for similar asset or liability in active market quoted price for identical or similar asset or liability in market that are not active and input other than quoted price that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level input are unobservable input for the asset or liability categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest

such circumstance an entity must determine whether the nature of it promise to the customer is to provide the underlying good or service the entity is the principal in the transaction or to arrange for the third party to provide the underlying good or service the entity is the agent in the transaction the amendment clarify in term of identifying performance obligation how entity would determine whether promised good or service are separately identifiable from other promise in contract and therefore would be accounted for separately the guidance allows entity to disregard good or service that are immaterial in the context of contract and provides an accounting policy election to account for shipping and handling activity fulfillment cost rather than additional promised service with regard to licensing the amendment clarify how an entity would evaluate the nature of it promise in granting license of intellectual property which determines whether the entity recognizes revenue over time or at point in time the amendment also address implementation issue relative to transition adding practical expedient for contract modification and clarifying what constitutes completed contract when

and loss on equity security they classify under current guidance available for sale in other comprehensive income oci they also will no longer be able to use the cost method of accounting for equity security that do not have readily determinable fair value instead for these type of equity investment that do not otherwise qualify for the net asset value practical expedient entity will be permitted to elect practicability exception and measure the investment at cost le impairment plus or minus observable price change in orderly transaction the asu also establishes an incremental recognition and disclosure requirement related to the presentation of fair value change of financial liability for which the fair value option fvo ha been elected under this guidance an entity would be required to separately present in oci the portion of the total fair value change attributable to instrument specific credit risk opposed to reflecting the entire amount in earnings this provision doe not apply to derivative instrument required to be measured at fair value with change in fair value recognized in current earnings for this standard is effective beginning january via cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings except for guidance relative to equity security without readily determinable fair value which is applied prospectively because the company ha historically held limited

guidance fewer put or call option embedded in debt instrument would require derivative accounting for this asu wa effective january the company outstanding debt with embedded put provision did not require separate derivative accounting under existing guidance result the adoption of this standard did not have material impact on the company consolidated result of operation and financial condition in march the fasb issued asu no simplifying the transition to the equity method of accounting which eliminates the existing requirement to apply the equity method of accounting retrospectively revising prior period if the equity method had always been applied when an entity obtains significant influence over previously held investment the new guidance would require the investor to apply the equity method prospectively from the date the investment qualifies for the equity method the investor would add the carrying value of the existing investment to the cost of any additional investment

after the adoption date in june the fasb issued asu no measurement of credit loss on financial instrument which revise guidance for the accounting for credit loss on financial instrument within it

financial condition presented in october the fasb issued asu no intra entity transfer of asset other than inventory which modifies existing guidance and is intended to reduce diversity in practice with respect to the accounting for the income tax consequence of intra entity transfer of asset the asu indicates that the current exception to income tax accounting that requires company to defer the income tax effect of certain intercompany transaction would apply only to intercompany inventory transaction that is the exception would no longer apply to intercompany sale and transfer of other

respect to how decision maker that hold an indirect interest in variable interest entity vie through common control party determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of the vie part of the

company pre consolidated result of operation and financial condition presented in january the fasb issued asu no clarifying the definition of business which narrow the existing definition of business and provides framework for evaluating whether transaction should be accounted for an acquisition or disposal of asset or business the asu requires an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross asset acquired is concentrated in single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable asset if the set of transferred asset and activity collectively the set is not business to be considered business the set would need to include an input and substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output the standard also narrow the

assigning the fair value of reporting unit to all of it asset and liability if that reporting unit had been acquired in business combination for this asu is effective prospectively to impairment test beginning january with early adoption permitted adopted this asu in the fourth quarter of in conjunction with it annual goodwill impairment testing the adoption did not have an impact on consolidated result of operation and financial condition in february the fasb issued asu no clarifying the scope of asset derecognition guidance and accounting for partial sale of nonfinancial asset this asu

pension and other postretirement benefit cost the new method measure service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation service cost are determined based on duration specific spot rate applied to the service cost cash flow the interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration specific spot rate to the year by year projected benefit payment the spot yield curve approach doe not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation the change in service and interest cost offset in the actuarial gain and loss recorded in other comprehensive income the company changed to the new method to provide more precise measure of service and interest cost by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flow and the discrete spot yield curve rate the company accounted for this change change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of result of the change to the spot yield curve approach annual defined benefit pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost decreased approximately million for the primary qualified pension plan the company assumption for the expected

of the measurement date the standard also establishes hierarchy for input used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable input and minimizes the use of unobservable input by requiring that the most observable input be used when available observable input are input market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from source independent of the company unobservable input are input that reflect the company assumption about the factor market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstance the hierarchy is broken down into three level level input are quoted price unadjusted in active market for identical asset or liability level input include quoted price for similar asset or liability in active market quoted price for identical or similar asset or liability in market that are not active and input other than quoted price that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level input are unobservable input for the asset or liability categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest

judgment about future event and can rely heavily on estimate and assumption the company complies with the requirement of asc contingency and related guidance and record liability for legal proceeding in those instance where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and where liability is probable where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is range the company record the most likely estimate of the loss or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate the company either discloses the amount of possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accrual if estimable or state that such an estimate can not be made the company discloses significant legal proceeding even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable or both

currently pending against the company allege use of some of the company mask and respirator product and seek damage from the company and other defendant for alleged personal injury from workplace exposure to asbestos silica coal mine dust or other occupational dust found in product manufactured by other defendant or generally in the workplace minority of the lawsuit and claim resolved by and currently pending against the company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from product previously manufactured by the company which are often unspecified well product manufactured by other defendant or occasionally at company premise the company current volume of new and pending matter is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filing in the company expects that filing of claim by unimpaired claimant in the future will continue to be at much lower level than in the past accordingly the number of claim alleging more serious injury including mesothelioma and other malignancy will represent greater percentage of total claim than in the past the company ha prevailed in all twelve case taken to trial including ten of the eleven case tried to verdict such trial occurred in and the case tried in and described below and an appellate reversal in of the jury verdict adverse to the company the remaining case tried in wa dismissed by the court at the close of plaintiff evidence based on the court legal finding that the plaintiff had not presented sufficient evidence to support jury verdict in august received unanimous verdict in it favor from jury in state court in kentucky in first respirator trial involving coal mine dust the estate of the plaintiff alleged that the respirator is defective and caused death because it did not protect from harmful coal mine dust the jury rejected plaintiff claim and returned verdict finding no liability against the verdict is final the plaintiff did not file an appeal in september received unanimous verdict in it favor from jury in state court in kentucky in second respirator trial involving coal mine dust the jury ultimately determined that the plaintiff claim were barred by the statute of limitation in november the court denied the plaintiff motion for new trial the plaintiff did not file an appeal thereby ending the litigation the company ha demonstrated in these past trial proceeding that it respiratory protection product are effective claimed when used in the intended manner and in the intended circumstance consequently the company belief that claimant are unable to establish that their medical condition even if significant are attributable to the company respiratory protection product nonetheless the company litigation experience indicates that claim of person with malignant condition are costlier to resolve than the claim of unimpaired person and it therefore belief the average cost of resolving pending and future claim on per claim basis will continue to be higher than it experienced in prior period when the vast majority of claim were asserted by medically unimpaired claimant previously reported the state of west virginia through it attorney general filed complaint in against the company and two other manufacturer of respiratory protection product in the circuit court of lincoln county west virginia and amended it complaint in the amended complaint seek substantial but unspecified compensatory damage primarily for reimbursement of the cost allegedly incurred by the state for worker compensation and healthcare benefit

november the state filed motion to bifurcate the lawsuit into separate liability and damage proceeding at the hearing on the motion the court declined to bifurcate the lawsuit no liability ha been recorded for this matter because the company belief that liability is not probable and estimable at this time in addition the company is not able to estimate possible loss or range of loss given the lack of any meaningful discovery response by the state of west virginia the otherwise minimal activity in this case and the fact that the complaint asserts claim against two other manufacturer where

responsibility for legal cost well for settlement and judgment is currently shared in an informal arrangement among aearo cabot american optical corporation and subsidiary of warner lambert and their respective insurer the payor group liability is allocated among the party based on the number of year each company sold respiratory product under the ao safety brand and or owned the ao safety division of american optical table of content corporation and the alleged year of exposure of the individual plaintiff aearo share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement entered into between aearo and cabot on july this agreement provides that so long aearo pay to cabot quarterly fee of cabot will retain responsibility and liability for and indemnify aearo against any

determine the impact of these potential development on it current estimate of aearo share of liability for these existing and future claim if any of the development described above were to occur the actual amount of these liability for existing and future claim could be significantly larger than the amount accrued because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claim that have not
