technology and business process and ultimate technical or commercial success are not certain refer to note on page for summary of the company research and development expense environmental protection the company design operates and maintains it facility to avoid potential spill or leak and to minimize the impact of those that may occur chevron requires it facility and operation to have operating standard and process and emergency response plan that address significant risk identified through site specific risk and impact assessment chevron also requires that sufficient resource be available to execute these plan in the unlikely event that major spill or leak occurs chevron also maintains worldwide emergency response team comprised of employee are trained in various aspect of emergency response including post incident remediation to complement the company capability chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperative including the marine spill response corporation which operates in territorial water and oil spill response ltd which operates globally the company is founding member of the marine well containment company whose primary mission is to expediently deploy containment equipment and system to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of future loss of control of deepwater well in the gulf of mexico in addition the company is member of subsea well response project which ha the objective to further develop the industry capability to contain and shut in subsea well control incident in different region of the world the company is committed to improving energy efficiency in it day to day operation and is required to comply with the greenhouse gas related law and regulation to which it is subject refer to item risk factor on page through for further discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and climate change and the associated risk to chevron business refer to management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation on page for additional information on environmental matter and their impact on chevron and on the company environmental expenditure refer to page and note beginning on page for discussion of environmental remediation provision and year end reserve item risk factorschevron is global energy company and it operating and financial result are subject to variety of risk inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical business many of these risk are not within the company control and could materially impact the company result of operation and financial condition chevron is exposed to the effect of changing commodity price chevron is primarily in commodity business that ha history of price volatility the single largest variable that affect the company result of operation is the price of crude oil which can be influenced by general economic condition industry production and inventory level technology advancement production quota or other action that might be imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting country opec or other producer weather related damage and disruption due to other natural or human cause beyond our control competing fuel price and geopolitical risk chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity price core part of it business planning process an investment in the company carry significant exposure to fluctuation in global crude oil price extended period of low price for crude oil can have material adverse impact on the company result of operation financial condition and liquidity among other thing the company upstream earnings cash flow and capital and exploratory expenditure program could be negatively affected could it production and proved reserve upstream asset may also become impaired downstream earnings could be negatively affected they depend upon the supply and demand for refined product and the associated margin on refined product sale significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company credit rating potentially increase financing cost and reduce access to capital market the company may be unable to realize anticipated cost saving expenditure reduction and asset sale that are intended to compensate for such downturn in some case liability associated with divested asset may return to the company when an acquirer of those asset subsequently declares bankruptcy in addition extended period of low commodity price can have material adverse impact on the result of operation financial condition and liquidity of the company supplier vendor partner and equity affiliate upon which the company own result of operation and financial condition depends the scope of chevron business will decline if the company doe not successfully develop resource the company is in an extractive business therefore if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produce with good prospect for future organic opportunity or through acquisition the company business will decline creating and maintaining an inventory of project depends on many factor including obtaining and renewing right to explore develop and produce hydrocarbon drilling success reservoir optimization ability to bring long lead time capital intensive project to completion on budget and on schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature property the company operation could be disrupted by natural or human cause beyond it control chevron operates in both urban area and remote and sometimes inhospitable region the company operation are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human cause beyond it control including physical risk from hurricane severe storm flood and other form of severe weather war accident civil unrest political event fire earthquake system failure cyber threat terrorist act and epidemic or pandemic disease such the coronavirus any of which could result in suspension of operation or harm to people or the natural environment chevron risk management system are designed to ass potential physical and other risk to it operation and asset and to plan for their resiliency while capital investment review and decision incorporate potential range of physical risk such storm severity and frequency sea level rise air and water temperature precipitation fresh water access wind speed and earthquake severity among other factor it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing frequency or severity of such event any of which could have material adverse effect on the company result of operation or financial condition targeting chevron process control network or other digital infrastructure could have material adverse impact on the company business and result of operation there are numerous and evolving risk to chevron cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actor including criminal hacker state sponsored intrusion industrial espionage and employee malfeasance these cyber threat actor whether internal or external to chevron are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempt to access the company information technology it system and data including the it system of cloud provider and other third party with the company conduct business although chevron devotes significant resource to prevent unwanted intrusion and to protect it system and data whether such data is housed internally or by external third party the company ha experienced and will continue to experience cyber incident of varying degree in the conduct of it business cyber threat actor could compromise the company process control network or other critical system and infrastructure resulting in disruption to it business operation injury to people harm to the environment or it asset disruption in access to it financial reporting system or loss misuse or corruption of it critical data and proprietary information including without limitation it intellectual property and business information and that of it employee customer partner and other third party any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by delay or failure to detect cyber incident further the company ha exposure to cyber incident and the negative impact of such incident related to it critical data and proprietary information housed on third party it system including the cloud additionally authorized third party it system can be compromised and used to gain access or introduce malware to chevron it system during the normal course of business the company ha limited control and visibility over such third party it system cyber event could result in significant financial loss legal or regulatory violation reputational harm and legal liability and could ultimately have material adverse effect on the company business and result of operation the company operation have inherent risk and hazard that require significant and continuous oversight chevron result depend on it ability to identify and mitigate the risk and hazard inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry the company seek to minimize these operational risk by carefully designing and building it facility and conducting it operation in safe and reliable manner however failure to manage these risk effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incident including release explosion or mechanical failure resulting in personal injury loss of life environmental damage loss of revenue legal liability and or disruption to operation chevron ha implemented and maintains system of corporate policy process and system behavior and compliance mechanism to manage safety health environmental reliability and efficiency risk to verify compliance with applicable law and policy and to respond to and learn from unexpected incident in certain situation where chevron is not the operator the company may have limited influence and control over third party which may limit it ability to manage and control such risk chevron business subject the company to liability risk from litigation or government action the company produce transport refines and market potentially hazardous material and it purchase handle and disposes of other potentially hazardous material in the course of it business chevron operation also produce byproduct which may be considered pollutant often these operation are conducted through joint venture over which the company may have limited influence and control any of these activity could result in liability or significant delay in operation arising from private litigation or government action for example liability or delay could result from an accidental unlawful discharge or from new conclusion about the effect of the company operation on human health or the environment in addition to the extent that societal pressure or political or other factor are involved it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company causation of or contribution to the asserted damage or to other mitigating factor for information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved see note to the consolidated financial statement beginning on page the company doe not insure all potential loss which could result in significant financial exposure the company doe not have commercial insurance or third party indemnity to fully cover all operational risk or potential liability in the event of significant incident or series of incident causing catastrophic loss result the company is to substantial extent self insured for such event the company relies on existing liquidity financial resource and borrowing capacity to meet short term obligation that would arise from such an event or series of event the occurrence of significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is self insured not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have material adverse effect on the company result of operation or financial condition political instability and significant change in the legal and regulatory environment could harm chevron business the company operation particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environment in the various country in which it operates ha occurred in the past action could be taken by government to increase public ownership of the company partially or wholly owned business to force contract renegotiations or to impose additional tax or royalty in certain location government have proposed or imposed on the company operation trade currency exchange control burdensome tax and public disclosure requirement that might harm the company competitiveness or relation with other government or third party in other country political condition have existed that may threaten the safety of employee and the company continued presence in those country and internal unrest act of violence or strained relation between government and the company or other government may adversely affect the company operation those development have at time significantly affected the company operation and result and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such country further chevron is required to comply with sanction and other trade law and regulation which depending upon their scope could adversely impact the company operation in certain country for example with respect to our operation in venezuela discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement other contingency and commitment other contingency future event could result in the environment in venezuela becoming more challenged which could lead to increased business disruption and volatility in the associated financial result in addition litigation or change in national state or local environmental regulation or law including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas such those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or ban on drilling could adversely affect the company current or anticipated future operation and profitability regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emission ha increased and could continue to increase chevron operational cost and reduce demand for chevron hydrocarbon and other product in the year ahead company in the energy industry like chevron may be challenged by further increase in international and domestic regulation relating to ghg emission like any significant change in the regulatory environment ghg regulation could have the impact of curtailing profitability in the oil and gas sector or rendering the extraction of the company oil and gas resource economically infeasible although the iea world energy outlook scenario anticipate oil and gas continuing to make up significant portion of the global energy mix through and beyond given their respective advantage in transportation and power generation if new onset of regulation contributes to decline in the demand for the company product this could have material adverse effect on the company and it financial condition international agreement and national regional and state legislation and regulatory measure that aim to limit or reduce ghg emission are currently in various stage of implementation for example the paris agreement went into effect in november and number of country are studying and may adopt additional policy to meet their paris agreement goal in some jurisdiction the company is already subject to currently implemented program such the renewable fuel standard program the european union emission trading system and the california cap and trade program and related low carbon fuel standard obligation other jurisdiction are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing law or regulation to directly regulate ghg emission through similar or other mechanism such for example via carbon tax singapore and canada or via cap and trade program california mexico and china the landscape continues to be in state of constant assessment and legal challenge with respect to these law and regulation making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact they will have on the company in the aggregate ghg emission related law and related regulation and the effect of operating in potentially carbon constrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital compliance operating and maintenance cost and could among other thing reduce demand for hydrocarbon and the company hydrocarbon based product make the company product more expensive adversely affect the economic feasibility of the company resource and adversely affect the company sale volume revenue and margin ghg emission carbon dioxide and methane that could be regulated include among others those associated with the company exploration and production of hydrocarbon such crude oil and natural gas the upgrading of production from oil sand into synthetic oil power generation the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon product the processing liquefaction and regasification of natural gas the transportation of crude oil natural gas and related product and consumer or customer use of the company hydrocarbon product many of these activity such consumer and customer use of the company product and substitute product well action taken by the company competitor in response to such law and regulation are beyond the company control consideration of ghg issue and the response to those issue through international agreement and national regional or state legislation or regulation are integrated into the company strategy and planning capital investment review and risk management tool and process where applicable they are also factored into the company long range supply demand and energy price forecast these forecast reflect long range effect from renewable fuel penetration energy efficiency standard climate related policy action and demand response to oil and natural gas price additionally the company ass carbon pricing risk by considering carbon cost in these forecast the actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change related law and regulation and amount of additional investment in new or technology or facility such carbon dioxide injection is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual law and regulation enacted in jurisdiction the company activity in it and market condition the ultimate effect of international agreement and national regional and state legislation and regulatory measure to limit ghg emission on the company financial performance and the timing of these effect will depend on number of factor such factor include among others the sector covered the ghg emission reduction required the extent to which chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocation or would need to purchase compliance instrument on the open market or through auction the price and availability of emission allowance and credit and the extent to which the company is able to recover the cost incurred through the pricing of the company product in the competitive marketplace further the ultimate impact of ghg emission related agreement legislation and measure on the company financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty for multitude of individual jurisdiction the outcome of political decision making process and the variable and tradeoff that inevitably occur in connection with such process increasing attention to environmental social and governance esg matter may impact our business increasing attention to climate change increasing societal expectation on company to address climate change and potential consumer and customer use of substitute to chevron product may result in increased cost reduced demand for our product reduced profit increased investigation and litigation and negative impact on our stock price and access to capital market increasing attention to climate change for example may result in demand shift for our hydrocarbon product and additional governmental investigation and private litigation against the company in addition organization that provide information to investor on corporate governance and related matter have developed rating process for evaluating company on their approach to esg matter such rating are used by some investor to inform their investment and voting decision unfavorable esg rating may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward chevron and our industry and to the diversion of investment to other industry which could have negative impact on our stock price and our access to and cost of capital change in management estimate and assumption may have material impact on the company consolidated financial

nigeria the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait the philippine republic of congo singapore south korea thailand the united kingdom the united state and venezuela earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of it upstream business segment the most significant factor affecting the result of operation for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil which is determined in global market outside of the company control in the company downstream business crude oil is the largest cost component of refined product it is the company objective to deliver competitive result and stockholder value in any business environment period of sustained lower price could result in the impairment or write off of specific asset in future period and cause the company to adjust operating expense and capital and exploratory expenditure along with other measure intended to improve financial performance similarly impairment or write offs may occur result of managerial decision

monitor development in the financial and credit market the level of worldwide economic activity and the implication for the company of movement in price for crude oil and natural gas management take these development into account in the conduct of daily operation and for business planning comment related to earnings trend for the company major business area are follows upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry price for crude oil and natural gas crude oil and natural gas price are subject to external factor over which the company ha no control including product demand connected with global economic condition industry production and inventory level technology advancement production quota or other action imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting country opec or other producer action of regulator weather related damage and disruption competing fuel price and regional supply interruption or fear thereof that may be caused by military conflict civil unrest or political uncertainty any of these factor could also inhibit the company production capacity in an affected region the company closely monitor development in the country in which it operates and hold investment and seek to manage risk in operating it facility and business the longer term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also function of other factor including the company ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas change in fiscal term of contract and change in tax and other applicable law and regulation the company continues to actively manage it schedule of work contracting procurement and supply chain activity to effectively manage cost and support operational goal price level for capital exploratory cost and operating expense associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factor beyond the company control including but not limited to the general level of inflation tariff or other tax imposed on good or service and commoditized price charged by the industry material and service provider the spot market for many service and material fell overall industry drilling activity in north america declined in particularly onshore however industry activity contract financial pressure on supplier ha increased which may limit further de escalation and or lead to consolidation across the supplier community impacting cost the international and offshore rig market are also showing some sign of weakness activity ha pulled back however pricing for some product and service remains resilient many supplier have reset expectation of higher industry spend and instead are looking to higher pricing and margin on more limited scope of work chevron utilizes contract with various pricing mechanism there may be delay in when the company cost reflect the change in market trend capital and exploratory expenditure and operating expense could also be affected by damage to production facility caused by severe weather or civil unrest delay in construction or other factor the chart above show the trend in benchmark price for brent crude oil west texas intermediate wti crude oil and henry hub natural gas the majority of the company equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark the brent price averaged per barrel for the full year compared to in brent price increased through the first half of due to opec production cut and sanction on iran and venezuela price started to decline due to heightened concern about slowing macro economy and weakening oil demand growth amid trade tension between the discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operationsu and china opec announced additional production cut in december leading to price increase with brent price at at the end of the year of mid february the brent price wa per barrel declined more than percent since december primarily due to concern about demand erosion following the coronavirus outbreak the wti price averaged per barrel for the full year compared to in wti traded at discount to brent throughout differential to brent have ranged between to in primarily due to pipeline infrastructure constraint which have restricted flow of inland crude to export outlet on the gulf coast variability in other factor impacting supply and demand of each benchmark crude also affect price differential of mid february the wti price wa per barrel chevron ha interest in the production of heavy crude oil in california indonesia the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait venezuela and in certain field in angola and china see page for the company average and international crude oil sale price in contrast to price movement in the global market for crude oil price change for natural gas are more closely aligned with seasonal supply and demand and infrastructure condition in local market in the united state price at henry hub averaged per thousand cubic foot mcf during compared with during of mid february the henry hub spot price wa per mcf increased production in the permian basin ha resulted in insufficient gas pipeline and fractionation capacity in the near term and over supply condition leading to depressed natural gas and natural gas liquid price in west texas sizable portion of chevron natural gas production come from the permian basin resulting in natural gas realization that are significantly lower than the henry hub price outside the united state price change for natural gas depend on wide range of supply demand and regulatory circumstance chevron sell natural gas into the domestic pipeline market in many location in some location chevron ha invested in long term project to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other market the company long term contract price for liquefied natural gas lng are typically linked to crude oil price most of the equity lng offtake from the operated australian lng project is committed under binding long term contract with the remainder to be sold in the asian spot lng market the asian spot market reflects the supply and demand for lng in the pacific basin and is not directly linked to crude oil price international natural gas realization averaged per mcf during compared with per mcf during see page for the company average natural gas

equivalent production in will grow up to percent compared to assuming brent crude oil price of per barrel and excluding the impact of anticipated asset sale this estimate is subject to many factor and uncertainty including quota or other action that may be imposed by opec tariff and trade sanction price effect on entitlement volume change in fiscal term or restriction on the scope of company operation delay in construction reservoir performance greater than expected decline in production from mature field start up or ramp up of project fluctuation in demand for natural gas in various market weather condition that may shut in production civil unrest changing geopolitics delay in completion of maintenance turnaround or other disruption to operation the outlook for future production level is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunity and the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production the company ha increased it investment

environmental and other regulation that could materially impact the company result of operation or financial condition most of the cost of complying with existing law and regulation pertaining to company operation and product are embedded in the normal cost of business however it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investment in new or existing technology or facility or the amount of increased operating cost to be incurred in the future to prevent control reduce or eliminate release of hazardous material or other pollutant into the environment remediate and restore area damaged by prior release of hazardous material or comply with new environmental law or regulation although these cost may be significant to the result of operation in any single period the company doe not presently expect them to have material adverse effect on the company liquidity or financial position accidental leak and spill requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business the company may incur expense for corrective action at various owned and previously owned facility and at third party owned waste disposal site used by the company an obligation may arise when operation are closed or sold or at non chevron site where company product have been handled or disposed of most of the expenditure to fulfill these obligation relate to facility and site where past operation followed practice and procedure that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standard using definition and guideline established by the american petroleum institute chevron estimated it worldwide environmental spending in at approximately billion for it consolidated company included in these expenditure were approximately billion of environmental capital expenditure and billion of cost associated with the prevention control abatement or elimination of hazardous substance and pollutant from operating closed or divested site and the decommissioning and restoration of site for total worldwide environmental capital expenditure are estimated at billion these capital cost are in addition to the ongoing cost of complying with environmental regulation and the cost to remediate previously contaminated site critical accounting estimate and assumption management make many estimate and assumption in the application of accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america gaap that may have material impact on the company consolidated financial statement and related disclosure and on the comparability of such information over different reporting period such estimate and assumption affect reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense well disclosure of contingent asset and liability estimate and assumption are based on management experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statement materially different result can occur circumstance change and additional information becomes known the discussion in this section of critical accounting estimate and assumption is according to the disclosure guideline of the security and exchange commission sec wherein the nature of the estimate and assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matter or the susceptibility of such matter to change the impact of the estimate and assumption on the company financial condition or operating performance is material the development and selection of accounting estimate and assumption including those deemed critical and the associated disclosure in this discussion have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of director the area of accounting

reserve are estimate of future production that impact certain asset and expense account included in the consolidated financial statement proved reserve are the estimated quantity of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic condition operating method and government regulation proved reserve include both developed and undeveloped volume proved developed reserve represent volume expected to be recovered through existing well with existing equipment and operating method proved undeveloped reserve are volume expected to be recovered from new well on undrilled proved acreage or from existing well where relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion variable impacting chevron estimated volume of crude oil and natural gas reserve include field performance available technology commodity price and development and production cost the estimate of crude oil and natural gas reserve are important to the timing of expense recognition for cost incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing asset impact of oil and gas reserve on chevron

gas producing property for impairment significant reduction in the estimated reserve of property would trigger an impairment review proved reserve and in some case portion of unproved resource are used to estimate future production volume in the cash flow model for further discussion of estimate and assumption used in impairment assessment see impairment of property plant and equipment and investment in affiliate below refer to table reserve quantity information beginning on page for the change in proved reserve estimate for the three year ended december and to table vii change in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow from proved reserve on page for estimate of proved reserve value for each of the three year ended december this oil and gas reserve commentary should be read in conjunction with the property plant and equipment section of note beginning on page which includes description of the successful effort method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activity impairment of property plant and equipment and investment in affiliate the company ass it property plant and equipment pp for possible impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flow expected from the asset an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over it estimated fair value determination to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimate on highly uncertain matter such future commodity price operating expense production profile and the outlook for global or regional market supply and demand condition for crude oil natural gas commodity chemical and refined product however the impairment review and calculation are based on assumption that are generally consistent with the company business plan and long term investment decision refer also to the discussion of impairment of property plant and equipment in note on page and to the section on property plant and equipment in note summary of significant accounting policy beginning on page the company routinely performs impairment review when triggering event arise to determine whether any write down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required for example when significant downward revision to crude oil and natural gas reserve are made for any single field or concession an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable similarly significant downward revision in the company crude oil or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment review for impacted upstream asset in addition impairment could occur due to change in national state or local environmental regulation or law including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas also if the expectation of sale of particular asset or asset group in any period ha been deemed more likely than not an impairment review is performed and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group no impairment charge is required such calculation are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operationsdisposed asset that are not impaired on held and used basis could possibly become impaired if decision is made to sell such asset that is the asset would be impaired if they are classified held for sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale le cost to sell are le than the asset associated carrying value investment in common stock of affiliate that are accounted for under the equity method well investment in other security of these equity investees are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment fall below the company carrying value when this occurs determination must be made to whether this loss is other than temporary in which case the investment is impaired because of the number of differing assumption potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment sensitivity analysis is not practicable in the company recorded impairment and write offs for certain oil and gas property following the review and approval of it business plan and capital expenditure program result of the company disciplined approach to capital allocation and downward revision in it longer term commodity price outlook the company will reduce funding to various natural gas related upstream opportunity including appalachia shale kitimat lng and other international project in addition the revised long term oil price outlook resulted in an impairment of big foot no individually material impairment of pp or investment were recorded for or sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these period if other assumption had been used in impairment review and impairment calculation is not practicable given the broad range of the company pp and the number of assumption involved in the estimate that is favorable change to some assumption might have avoided the need to impair any asset in these period whereas unfavorable change might have caused an additional unknown number of other asset to become impaired or resulted in larger impact on impaired asset asset retirement obligation in the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation aro the company us various assumption and judgment including such factor the existence of legal obligation estimated amount and timing of settlement discount and inflation rate and the expected impact of advance in technology and process improvement sensitivity analysis of the aro impact on earnings for is not practicable given the broad range of the company long lived asset and the number of assumption involved in the estimate that is favorable change to

in note under the relevant heading actual rate may vary significantly from estimate because of unanticipated change beyond the company control for the company used an expected long term rate of return of percent and discount rate for service cost of percent and discount rate for interest cost of percent for pension plan the actual return for wa percent for the year ended december actual asset return averaged percent for these plan additionally with the exception of three year within this year period actual asset return for these plan equaled or exceeded percent during each year total pension expense for wa billion an increase in the expected long term return on plan asset or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense and vice versa an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long term rate of return assumption percent increase in this assumption for the company primary pension plan which accounted for about percent of companywide pension expense would have reduced total pension plan expense for by approximately million percent increase in the discount rate for this plan would have reduced pension expense for by approximately million the aggregate funded status recognized at december wa net liability of approximately billion an increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation thus changing the funded status of plan

operationssensitivity of pension liability to the discount rate assumption percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company primary pension plan which accounted for about percent of the companywide pension obligation would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately million and would have decreased the plan underfunded status from approximately billion to billion for the company opeb plan expense for wa million and the total liability all unfunded at the end of wa billion for the main opeb plan the company used discount rate for service cost of percent and discount rate for interest cost of percent to measure expense in and percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligation at december discount rate change similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis resulted in an immaterial impact on opeb expense and opeb liability at the end of for information on the sensitivity of the health care cost trend rate refer to page in note under the heading

discount rate for interest expected return on plan arate of compensation aexpected return on plan asset the company estimated long term rate of return on pension asset are driven primarily by actual historical asset class return an assessment of expected future performance advice from external actuarial firm and the incorporation of specific asset class risk factor asset allocation are periodically updated using pension plan asset liability study and the company estimated long term rate of return are consistent with these study for the company used an expected long term rate of return of percent for pension plan asset which account for percent of the company pension plan asset in both and the company used long term rate of return of percent for these plan the market related value of asset of the main pension plan used in the determination of pension expense wa based on the market value in the three month preceding the year end measurement date management considers the three month time period long enough to minimize the effect of distortion from day to day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year for other plan market value of asset of year end is used in calculating the pension expense discount rate the discount rate assumption used to determine the and international pension and opeb plan obligation and expense reflect the rate at which benefit could be effectively settled and are equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis this analysis considered the projected benefit payment specific to the company plan and the yield on high quality bond the projected cash flow were discounted to the valuation date using the yield curve for the main pension and opeb plan the effective discount rate derived from this analysis at the end of were percent for the main pension plan and percent for the main opeb plan the discount rate for these plan at the end of were and percent respectively while in

exclude royalty and interest owned by others and reflect contractual arrangement and royalty obligation in effect at the time of the estimate proved reserve are classified either developed or undeveloped proved developed reserve are the quantity expected to be recovered through existing well with existing equipment and operating method proved undeveloped reserve are the quantity expected to be recovered from new well on undrilled acreage or from existing well where relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion due to the inherent uncertainty and the limited nature of reservoir data estimate of reserve are subject to change additional information becomes available proved reserve are estimated by company asset team composed of earth scientist and engineer part of

also reviewed with the board of director if major change to reserve were to occur between the annual review those matter would also be discussed with the board rac subteams also conduct in depth review during the year of many of the field that have large proved reserve quantity these review include an examination of the proved reserve record and documentation of their compliance with the chevron corporation reserve manual technology used in establishing proved reserve addition in addition to chevron proved reserve were based on wide range of geologic and engineering technology information generated from well such well log wire line sampling production and pressure testing fluid analysis and core analysis wa integrated with seismic data regional geologic study and information from analogous reservoir to provide reasonably certain proved reserve estimate both proprietary and commercially available analytic tool including reservoir simulation geologic modeling and seismic processing have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data these technology have been utilized extensively by the company in the past and the company belief that they provide high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserve estimate proved undeveloped reserve at the end of proved undeveloped reserve totaled billion barrel of oil equivalent boe decrease of million boe from year end the decrease wa due to million boe in revision the transfer of million boe to proved developed and million boe in sale partially offset by million boe in
