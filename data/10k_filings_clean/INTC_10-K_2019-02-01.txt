may differ materially currency exchange rateswe are exposed to currency exchange risk of non dollar denominated investment in debt instrument and loan receivable and may economically hedge this risk with foreign currency contract such currency forward contract or currency interest rate swap gain or loss on these non currency investment are generally offset by corresponding loss or gain on the related hedging instrument we are exposed to currency exchange risk from our non dollar denominated debt indebtedness and may use foreign currency contract designated cash flow hedge to manage this risk substantially all of our revenue is transacted in dollar however significant portion of our operating expenditure and capital purchase are incurred in other currency primarily the euro the japanese yen the israeli shekel and the chinese yuan we have established currency risk management program to protect currency exchange rate risk associated with non dollar forecasted future cash flow and existing non dollar monetary asset and liability we may also hedge currency risk arising from funding of foreign currency denominated future investment we may utilize foreign currency contract such currency forward or option contract in these hedging program we considered the historical trend in currency exchange rate and determined that it wa reasonably possible that weighted average adverse change of in currency exchange rate could be experienced in the near term such an adverse change after taking into account balance sheet hedge only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability position outstanding of december and december would result in an adverse impact on income before tax of le than million and le than million respectively interest rateswe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt the primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal and the financial flexibility to fund our business while maximizing yield which generally track the dollar three month libor we generally enter into interest rate contract to convert the return on our fixed rate debt investment with remaining maturity longer than six month into dollar three month libor based return we also enter into swap to convert fixed rate coupon payment into floating rate coupon payment for our existing indebtedness gain or loss on these instrument are generally offset by corresponding loss or gain on the related hedging instrument hypothetical increase in benchmark interest rate of up to after taking into account investment hedge would have resulted in decrease in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately million of december hypothetical decrease of would have resulted in an increase of approximately million of december taking into account floating rate debt and fixed rate debt that is swapped to floating rate debt hypothetical increase in interest rate of up to would result in an increase in annual interest expense on our indebtedness of approximately million from debt outstanding of december an increase of approximately million from debt outstanding of december we have changed our presentation from the prior year to show the impact of interest rate change on interest expense rather than on fair value of debt in order to present information that could hypothetically impact our net income and cash flow equity pricesour investment include marketable equity security and equity derivative instrument we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activity at the inception of our investment in the event we do decide to enter into hedge arrangement before doing we evaluate legal market and economic factor well the expected timing of disposal to determine whether hedging is appropriate our equity market risk management program may include equity derivative with or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrant equity option or other equity derivative we also utilize total return swap to offset change in liability related to the equity market risk of certain deferred compensation arrangement gain or loss from change in fair value of these total return swap are generally offset by the loss or gain on the related liability md consolidated result and of contentsas of december the fair value

historical market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio assuming decline of in market price and after reflecting the impact of hedge and offsetting position the aggregate value of our marketable equity investment could decrease by approximately billion based on the value of december decrease in value of approximately billion based on the value of december using an assumed decline of beginning in explained in note recent accounting standard within the consolidated financial statement change in the fair value of our marketable equity security will be measured and recorded at fair value with change in fair value recorded through the income statement many of the same factor that could result in an adverse movement of equity market price affect our non marketable equity investment although we can not always quantify the impact directly financial market are volatile which could negatively affect the prospect of the company we invest in their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investment through liquidity event such initial public offering merger and private sale these type of investment involve

nvidia well accelerator product such asics application specific standard product and fpgas memory and storage product or connectivity product such cellular modem some of these competitor have developed or utilize competing computing architecture for specific market segment or application such low power application or emerging ai workload we also compete with internally developed semiconductor from oems cloud service provider and others including customer these company may choose to vertically integrate their own proprietary semiconductor design with their software asset to offer greater product differentiation or increase product margin or to customize such design for their specific computing workload we may also face new source of competition result of change in industry participant through for example acquisition or business collaboration well new entrant which could have significant impact on our competitive position ccg we are leading provider of platform for notebook in system and desktop including high end enthusiast pc we face existing and emerging competition in these product area tablet phone and other mobile device offered by numerous vendor are significant competitor to traditional pc for many usage and considerable blurring of system form factor currently exists in the marketplace we face strong competition from amd well from vendor who use application processor that are based on the arm architecture feature low power or long battery life operation and are built in soc format that integrate numerous function on one chip we are competing with number of large company in the development of cellular modem dcg we are leading provider of data center platform and face competition from incumbent competitor such amd provider of accelerator

company that make other type of semiconductor product such asics application specific standard product gpus digital signal processor and cpu targeted growth area for our programmable solution include communication data center industrial and military application the fpga life cycle is long relative to other intel product from the time that design win is secured it generally take three or more year before customer start volume production and we receive the associated revenue from such design win competitive factorsour product primarily compete based on performance energy efficiency integration ease of use innovative design feature price quality reliability security feature software ecosystem and developer support time to market brand recognition customer support and customization and availability the importance of these factor varies by the type of end system for the product for example performance might be among the most important factor for our product for data center server while energy efficiency and price well density and non volatility might be among the most important factor for our memory product our key competitive advantage include well positioned for growth in new era of data centric computing the proliferation of data from the cloud to the network and out to the edge the impending transition to and the growth of ai and analytics have driven profound shift in computing creating massive amount of largely untapped data and significant opportunity we believe we are one of the few company with product portfolio that span this new data centric world with product to help our customer process analyze store and transfer large amount of data we have the opportunity to be the leading end to end platform provider for our customer combination of our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facility with our global architecture design team we have made significant capital and investment in our integrated manufacturing network which enables to have more direct control over our design development and manufacturing process quality control product cost production timing performance power consumption and manufacturing yield we also have the scale and expertise necessary to enable deep engagement with our customer on their product need the increased cost of constructing new fabrication facility to support smaller transistor geometry and larger wafer ha led to reduced number of company that can build and equip leading edge manufacturing facility most of our competitor rely on third party foundry such taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd or samsung electronics co ltd and subcontractor for manufacturing and assembly and test need we also face competitive challenge associated with the development and implementation of our next generation process technology we announced earlier in that volume production on our process technology wa being delayed from the second half of into we have made progress on improving yield during and we expect based volume client system on retail shelf for the holiday season however the delay in our transition to next generation process technology may allow competitor to take advantage of potential improvement in performance energy efficiency cost and or other feature that may be offered by new process technology developed by third party foundry while we believe we derive significant competitive advantage from being an integrated device manufacturer discussed above we are also subject to the inherent risk of next generation process development intellectual property

consider an accounting policy to be critical estimate if we must make assumption that were uncertain when the judgment wa made and change in the estimate assumption or selection of different estimate methodology could have significant impact on our financial position and the result that we report in our consolidated financial statement while we believe that our estimate assumption and judgment are reasonable they are based on information available when the estimate wa made refer to note accounting policy within the consolidated financial statement for further information on our critical accounting estimate and policy which are follows inventory the transition of manufacturing cost to inventory excluding factory excess capacity cost inventory reflected at the lower of cost or net realizable value considering future demand and market condition property plant and equipment the useful life determination and the related timing of when depreciation begin long lived asset the

business financial condition cash flow and result of operation and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factor do not identify all risk that we face our operation could also be affected by factor that are not presently known to or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operation due to risk and uncertainty known and unknown our past financial result may not be reliable indicator of future performance and historical trend should not be used to anticipate result or trend in future period refer also to the other information set forth in this annual report on form including in md and our financial statement and the related note change in product demand can adversely affect our financial result demand for our product is variable and hard to predict our product are used in different market segment and demand for our product may vary within or among the market segment served by our pc centric and data centric business it is difficult to forecast these change and their impact for example demand for our platform product may increase in one or more market segment while decreasing in others change in the demand for our product particularly our ccg and dcg platform product may reduce our revenue lower our gross margin or require to write down the value of our asset important factor that could lead to variation in the demand for our product include business condition including downturn in the market segment in which we operate or in the global or regional economy consumer confidence or income level and the level of customer capital spending which may be impacted by change in market condition including change in government borrowing taxation or spending policy the credit market or expected inflation employment and energy or other commodity price our ability to timely introduce competitive product competitive and pricing pressure including new product introduction and other action taken by competitor the level of our customer inventory customer order pattern including order cancellation which may be affected by maturing product cycle disruption affecting customer and other factor market acceptance and industry support of our new and maturing product including the introduction and availability of product used together with our product and customer product need and emerging technology trend including change in the level and nature of customer and end user computing workload other key information of contentsdue to the complexity of our manufacturing operation we may be unable to timely respond to fluctuation in demand and we may incur significant charge and cost because we own and operate high tech fabrication facility our operation have high cost that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term including our cost related to utilization of existing facility facility construction and equipment and the employment and training of highly skilled workforce if product demand decrease or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charge which would lower our gross margin if the demand decrease is prolonged our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized and we may be required to write down our long lived asset which would increase our expense we may also be required to shorten the useful life of under used facility and equipment and accelerate depreciation conversely if product demand increase we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand which could result in loss of revenue opportunity or market share legal claim and or damage to customer relationship we face significant competition the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market development change in industry standard change in customer need and frequent product introduction and improvement if we do not anticipate and respond to these development our competitive position may weaken and our product or technology might be uncompetitive or become obsolete our product primarily compete based on performance energy efficiency integration ease of use innovative design feature price quality reliability security feature software ecosystem and developer support time to market brand recognition customer support and customization and availability the importance of these factor may vary by product for example if we do not continue to introduce data center platform product with performance leadership our competitive position and market segment share in our dcg business may be adversely affected we will not realize our strategic goal to become the leading end to end provider for the new data centric era of computing if our product do not meet our customer need in an increasingly competitive landscape we face intense competition across our product portfolio from company offering platform product accelerator product such gpus asics application specific standard product and fpgas memory and storage product connectivity product such cellular modem and other semiconductor product some of these competitor have developed or utilize competing computing architecture for specific market segment or application and these architecture can produce beneficial network effect for competitor if an ecosystem of customer and application developer for such architecture grows at scale we also compete with internally developed semiconductor from oems cloud service provider and others including customer and with new entrant introduction of competitive new product aggressive pricing and other action taken by competitor could harm demand for our product and our business additionally number of business combination and strategic partnership in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several year and more could occur in the future consolidation could lead to fewer customer partner or supplier any of which could negatively affect our financial result to compete successfully we must maintain successful effort develop new product and production process and improve our existing product and process ahead of competitor for example we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facility including the construction of new fabrication facility to support smaller transistor geometry and in the development of the advanced manufacturing technology to produce such transistor we do not expect all of our investment to be successful we may be unable to develop and market new product successfully and the product and technology we invest in and develop may not be well received by customer our investment may not contribute to our future operating result for several year if at all and such contribution may not meet our expectation or even cover the cost of such investment additionally the product and technology offered by others may affect demand for or pricing of our product if we are not able to compete effectively our financial result will be adversely affected including reduced revenue and gross margin and we may be required to accelerate the write down of the value of certain asset our investment in new business product and technology are inherently risky and may not succeed in recent year in connection with our strategic transformation to data centric company we have entered new area and introduced adjacent product in programmable solution ai and autonomous driving we have also expanded our adjacent product offering in client computing the data center the internet of thing and memory with offering such modem silicon photonics solution and intel optane technology product result we face new source of competition including in certain of these market segment from incumbent competitor with established technology and customer base and greater brand recognition these developing product and market segment may require significant investment may not grow significantly projected or at all or may utilize technology that are different from the one that we develop and manufacture and we may not realize an adequate return on our investment for example ai and machine learning are increasingly driving innovation in technology but if they fail to deliver the benefit anticipated or if our customer use competing technology for these workload we may not realize return on our investment in these area to be successful we need to cultivate new industry relationship with customer and partner in these market segment in addition we must continually improve the cost performance integration and energy efficiency of our product well expand our software capability to provide customer with comprehensive computing solution despite our ongoing effort there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our product and service in these various market segment change in the mix of product sold may impact our financial result our pricing and margin vary across our product and market segment due in part to marketability of our product and difference in their feature or manufacturing cost for example our platform product offering range from lower priced and entry level platform such those based on intel atom processor to higher end platform based on intel xeon processor our adjacent product also typically have significantly lower margin than our higher priced platform product if demand shift from our higher priced to lower priced platform product in any of our market segment or if our adjacent product represent an increasingly greater share of our mix of product sold our gross margin percentage may decrease other key information of contentswe operate globally and are subject to significant risk in many jurisdiction global or regional condition may harm our financial result we have manufacturing assembly and test sale and other operation in many country and some of our business activity may be concentrated in one or more geographic area moreover sale outside the accounted for approximately of our revenue for the fiscal year ended december result our operation and our financial result including our ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell product and the demand for our product may be adversely affected by number of global and regional factor outside of our control adverse change in global or regional economic condition including recession or slowing growth change or uncertainty in fiscal or monetary policy higher interest rate tighter credit inflation lower capital expenditure by business including on it infrastructure increase in unemployment and lower consumer confidence and spending could significantly harm demand for our product and make it more challenging to forecast our operating result and make business decision including regarding prioritization of investment in our business an economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk higher borrowing cost or limit on our access to capital market reduced liquidity adverse impact on our supplier failure of counterparties and other financial institution and decline in the value of our financial instrument international trade dispute may result in increased tariff trade barrier and other protectionist measure that could increase our manufacturing cost make our product le competitive reduce consumer demand or impede or slow the movement of our good across border increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further change in trade policy domestic sourcing initiative or other formal and informal measure that could make it more difficult to sell our product in some market we may be adversely affected by other global and regional factor including geopolitical and security issue such armed conflict and civil or military unrest political instability human right concern and terrorist activity natural disaster public health issue and other catastrophic event inefficient infrastructure and other disruption such supply chain interruption and large scale outage or unreliable provision of service from utility transportation data hosting or telecommunication provider formal or informal imposition of new or revised export import or doing business regulation including trade sanction and tariff which could be changed without notice government restriction on or nationalization of our operation in any country or restriction on our ability to repatriate earnings from particular country differing employment practice and labor issue ineffective legal protection of our ip right in certain country local business and cultural factor that differ from our current standard and practice continuing uncertainty regarding social political immigration and tax and trade policy in the and abroad including result of the united kingdom vote to withdraw from the european union and fluctuation in the market value of our domestic and international investment which can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration or loss interest rate change financial result political risk sovereign risk or other factor we are subject to law and regulation worldwide that may differ among jurisdiction affecting our operation in area including but not limited to ip ownership and infringement tax import and export requirement anti corruption foreign exchange control and cash repatriation restriction data privacy requirement competition advertising employment product regulation environment health and safety requirement and consumer law compliance with such requirement may be onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operation negatively for example unfavorable development with evolving law and regulation worldwide related to or autonomous driving technology may limit global adoption impede our strategy and negatively impact our long term expectation for our investment in these area although we have policy control and procedure designed to help ensure compliance with applicable law there can be no assurance that our employee contractor supplier and or agent will not violate such law or our policy violation of these law and regulation could result in fine criminal sanction against our officer or our employee prohibition on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation we may be affected by fluctuation in currency exchange rate we are potentially exposed to adverse well beneficial movement in currency exchange rate although most of our sale occur in dollar expense may be paid in local currency an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customer of our product in those market outside the where we sell in dollar and weakened dollar could increase the cost of expense such payroll utility tax and marketing expense well overseas capital expenditure we also conduct certain investing and financing activity in local currency our hedging program may not be effective to offset any or more than portion of the adverse impact of currency exchange rate movement therefore change in exchange rate could harm our result of operation and financial condition other key information of contentscatastrophic event could have material adverse effect on our operation and financial result our operation and business and those of our customer and supplier could be disrupted by natural disaster industrial accident public health issue cybersecurity incident interruption of service from utility transportation telecommunication or it system provider or other catastrophic event our headquarters and many of our operation and facility are in location that are prone to earthquake and other natural disaster global climate change may result in certain natural disaster occurring more frequently or with greater intensity such drought wildfire storm sea level rise and flooding and could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facility located in semi arid region catastrophic event could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver product to our customer receive production material from our supplier or perform critical function which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditure to resume operation while we maintain business recovery plan that are intended to enable to recover from natural disaster or other event that can be disruptive to our business some of our system are not fully redundant and we can not be sure that our plan will fully protect from all such disruption furthermore even if our operation are unaffected or recover quickly if our customer can not timely resume their own operation due to catastrophic event they may reduce or cancel their order which may adversely affect our result of operation we maintain program of insurance coverage for variety of property casualty and other risk the type and amount of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability cost and decision with respect to risk retention some of our policy have large deductible and broad exclusion in addition one or more of our insurance provider may be unable or unwilling to pay claim loss not covered by insurance may be large which could harm our result of operation and financial condition damage to our reputation could damage our business our reputation is critical factor in our relationship with customer employee government supplier and other stakeholder if we fail to address or appear to fail to address issue that give rise to reputational risk including those described throughout this risk factor section we could significantly harm our reputation and our brand our reputation may also be damaged by how we respond to corporate crisis corporate crisis can arise from catastrophic event well from incident involving unethical behavior or misconduct product quality security or safety issue allegation of legal noncompliance internal control failure corporate governance issue data breach workplace safety incident environmental incident the use of our product for illegal or objectionable application marketing practice medium statement the conduct of our supplier or representative and other issue or incident that whether actual or perceived result in adverse publicity if we fail to respond quickly and effectively to address such crisis the ensuing negative public reaction could significantly harm our reputation and our brand and could lead to increase in litigation claim and asserted damage or subject to regulatory action or restriction damage to our reputation could reduce demand for our product and adversely affect our business and operating environment it could reduce investor confidence in adversely affecting our stock price it may also limit our ability to be seen an employer of choice when competing for highly skilled employee moreover repairing our reputation and brand may be difficult time consuming and expensive we are vulnerable to product and manufacturing related risk we are subject to risk associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology production of integrated circuit is complex process realizing the economics of moore law is strategic priority and we are continually engaged in the development of next generation process technology at increasingly advanced node we may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process node and production process our effort to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risk including difficulty in designing and developing such next generation process technology failure to realize the expected benefit of next generation process technology and investment in manufacturing asset and facility that are made year in advance of the process node introduction risk inherent in the development of next generation process technology include production timing delay lower than anticipated manufacturing yield and product defect and erratum for example we announced earlier in that volume production on our process technology wa being delayed from the second half of into we have made progress on improving yield during and we expect based volume client system on retail shelf for the holiday season however the delay in our transition to next generation process technology may allow competitor to take advantage of potential improvement in performance energy efficiency cost and or other feature that may be offered by new process technology developed by third party foundry furthermore without the benefit of next generation process node including additional competitive feature on our product may result in larger die size product manufacturing supply constraint and increased product cost disruption in the production process can also result from error defect in material delay in obtaining or revising operating permit and license interruption in our supply of material or resource and disruption at our fabrication and assembly and test facility due to accident maintenance issue or unsafe working condition all of which could affect the timing of production ramp and yield production issue can lead to increased cost and may affect our ability to meet product demand which could adversely impact our business and the result of operation in addition if we face delay in the timing of our product introduction we could become le competitive and lose revenue opportunity and our gross margin could be adversely affected because we incur significant cost up front in the product development stage and earn revenue to offset these cost over time other key information of contentswe face supply chain risk thousand of supplier provide material and equipment that we use in production and other aspect of our business where possible we seek to have several source of supply however for certain material and equipment including photolithography tool we may rely on single or limited number of supplier or upon supplier in single location in addition supplier consolidation or business failure could impact the nature quality availability and pricing of the product and service available to the inability of supplier to deliver necessary production material or equipment could disrupt our production process and make it more difficult for to implement our business strategy production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resource such water silicon electricity gas and other material the unavailability or reduced availability of material or resource may require to reduce production or incur additional cost which could harm our business and result of operation our manufacturing operation and ability to meet product demand may also be impacted by ip or other litigation between our supplier where an injunction against intel or supplier could interrupt the availability of good or service supplied to intel by others we also rely on third party provider to manufacture and assemble and test certain component or product these have included component and product related to networking communication programmable semiconductor solution and memory and may include these and other component and product in the future if any of these third party are unable to perform these service on timely or cost effective basis in sufficient volume or at all we may encounter supply delay or disruption or incur additional cost that could adversely affect our business and financial result for example while we have an agreement providing for the supply of xpoint memory from imft for period following the close of micron purchase of our interest in imft we will need to fund and develop internal manufacturing option to continue xpoint memory supply in the longer term in addition increased regulation or stakeholder expectation regarding responsible sourcing practice could cause our compliance cost to increase or result in publicity that negatively affect our reputation moreover given that we use many material in the manufacturing of our product and rely on many supplier to provide these material but do not directly control the procurement or employment practice of such supplier we could be subject to similar financial or reputational risk result of our supplier conduct we are subject to the risk of product defect erratum or other product issue product defect and erratum deviation from published specification may result from problem in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test process component and product we purchase or license from third party supplier or attain through acquisition may also contain defect we could face risk if product that we design manufacture or sell or that include our technology cause personal injury or property damage even where the cause is unrelated to product defect or erratum these risk may increase our product are introduced into new device market segment technology or application including transportation and autonomous driving healthcare communication and financial service and other industrial infrastructure and consumer us cost from defect erratum or other product issue could include writing off some or all of the value of inventory recalling product that have been shipped providing product replacement or modification reimbursing customer for certain cost they incur defending against litigation and or paying resulting damage and paying fine imposed by regulatory agency these cost could be large and may increase expense and lower gross margin and result in delay or loss of revenue any product defect erratum or other issue could also damage our reputation negatively affect product demand delay product release or result in legal liability the announcement of product defect or erratum could cause customer to purchase product from competitor any of these occurrence could harm our business and financial result in addition although we maintain liability insurance our coverage ha certain exclusion and or may not adequately cover liability incurred our insurance provider may be unable or unwilling to pay claim and loss not covered by insurance could be large which could harm our financial condition we are subject to risk associated with environmental health and safety regulation the manufacturing and assembly and test of our product require the use of hazardous material that are subject to broad array of environmental health and safety law and regulation our failure to comply with these law or regulation could result in regulatory penalty fine and legal liability suspension of production alteration of our manufacturing and assembly and test process damage to our reputation and restriction on our operation or sale our failure to manage the use transportation emission discharge storage recycling or disposal of hazardous material could lead to increased cost or future liability our ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulation such air quality and wastewater requirement environmental law and regulation could also require to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify product design or incur other expense regulation in response to climate change could result in increased manufacturing cost associated with air pollution requirement and increased compliance and energy cost many new material that we are evaluating for use in our operation may be subject to regulation under environmental law and regulation these restriction could harm our business and result of operation by increasing our expense or requiring to alter manufacturing and assembly and test process other key information of contentswe are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risk we face risk related to cybersecurity threat and incident we regularly face attempt by others to gain unauthorized access through the internet or to introduce malicious software to our it system additionally individual or organization including malicious hacker state sponsored organization insider threat including employee and third party service provider or intruder into our physical facility may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the process of hardware and software product that we manufacture and service we provide due to the widespread use of our product we are frequent target of computer hacker and organization that intend to sabotage take control of or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other process product and service we are also target of malicious attacker who attempt to gain access to our network or data center or those of our customer or end user steal proprietary information related to our business product employee and customer or interrupt our system and service or those of our customer or others such attempt are increasing in number and in technical sophistication and if successful could expose and the affected party to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruption of our business operation our it infrastructure also includes product and service provided by third party and these provider may experience breach of their system and product that impact the security of our system and our proprietary or confidential information from time to time we encounter intrusion or unauthorized access to our network product service or infrastructure to date none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operation such incident whether or not successful could result in our incurring significant cost related to for example rebuilding internal system writing down inventory value implementing additional threat protection measure providing modification to our product and service defending against litigation responding to regulatory inquiry or action paying damage providing customer with incentive to maintain the business relationship or taking other remedial step with respect to third party well reputational harm in addition these threat are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measure while we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempt and attack against our network product and service and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through change to our internal process and tool and or change or update to our product and service we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threat in some instance we our customer and the user of our product and service may be unaware of an incident or it magnitude and effect we face risk related to security vulnerability in our product we or third party regularly identify security vulnerability with respect to our processor and other product well the operating system and workload running on them we have become more data centric company our processor and other product are being used in more and different critical application area that create new or increased cybersecurity and privacy risk including application that gather and process large amount of data such the cloud or internet of thing and critical infrastructure and automotive application the security vulnerability identified in our processor include category known side channel exploit such the variant referred to spectre and meltdown additional category and variant have been and may continue to be identified publicity about these and other security vulnerability and attempted or successful exploit whether accurate or inaccurate may result in increased attempt by third party to identify additional vulnerability although vulnerability have often been discovered and mitigated in advance of being exploited it is possible that vulnerability may not be mitigated before they become known we our customer and the user of our product may not promptly learn of or be able to fully ass the magnitude or effect of vulnerability including the extent if any to which vulnerability ha been exploited subsequent event or new information could develop that change our assessment of the impact of security vulnerability including additional information learned we develop and deploy mitigation or update become aware of additional variant evaluate the competitiveness of existing and new product address future warranty or other claim or customer satisfaction consideration well development in the course of any litigation or regulatory inquiry or action over these matter mitigation technique designed to address security vulnerability including software and firmware update or other preventative measure may not be available on timely basis or at all or may not operate intended or effectively resolve vulnerability for all application in addition we may be required to rely on third party including hardware software and service vendor well our customer and end user to develop and deploy mitigation technique and the availability effectiveness and performance impact of mitigation technique may depend solely or in part on the action of these third party in determining whether and how to develop and deploy mitigation we and such third party may make prioritization decision about which vulnerability to address which could delay or limit development or deployment of mitigation and harm our reputation security vulnerability and or mitigation technique may result in adverse performance effect reboots system instability or unavailability loss of functionality data loss or corruption unpredictable system behavior decision by customer and end user to limit or change the application in which they use our product or product feature or the misappropriation of data by third party security vulnerability and any limitation of or adverse effect resulting from mitigation technique can adversely affect our result of operation financial condition customer relationship prospect and reputation in number of way any of which may be material for example whether or not they involve attempted or successful exploit they may result in our incurring significant cost related to developing and deploying update and mitigation writing down inventory value defending against product claim and litigation responding to regulatory inquiry or action paying damage addressing customer satisfaction consideration providing product replacement or modification or taking other remedial step with respect to third party adverse publicity about security vulnerability or mitigation could damage our reputation with customer or user and reduce demand for our product and service these effect may be greater to the extent that competing product are not susceptible to the same vulnerability or if vulnerability can be more effectively mitigated in competing product moreover third party may release information regarding potential vulnerability of our product before mitigation are available which in turn could lead to attempted or successful exploit adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigation or otherwise harm our business and reputation for example information on the spectre and meltdown side channel variant wa prematurely reported publicly before mitigation technique to address all vulnerability were made widely available and certain of the mitigation technique did not operate intended other key information of contentswe may be subject to theft loss or misuse of personal data about our employee customer or other third party which could increase our expense damage our reputation or result in legal or regulatory proceeding the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by to run our business could result in significantly increased business and security cost or cost related to defending legal claim global privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating complex regulatory compliance environment cost to comply with and implement these privacy related and data protection measure could be significant and noncompliance could expose to significant monetary penalty damage to our reputation suspension of online service or site in certain country and even criminal sanction even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal state or international privacy related or data protection law and regulation could result in audit regulatory inquiry or proceeding against by governmental entity or other third party we are subject to ip risk and risk associated with litigation and regulatory proceeding we may be unable to enforce or protect our ip right we regard our patent copyright trade secret and other ip right important to the success of our business we rely on ip law well confidentiality and licensing agreement with our customer employee technology development partner and others to protect our ip right our ability to enforce these right is subject to general litigation risk well uncertainty to the enforceability of our ip right in various country enforcement may be costly and time consuming and may divert management attention when we seek to enforce our right we may be subject to claim that our ip right are invalid not enforceable or licensed to an opposing party our assertion of ip right may result in another party seeking to assert claim against which could harm our business government may adopt regulation and government or court may render decision requiring compulsory licensing of ip right or government may require product to meet standard that favor local company our inability to enforce our ip right under any of these circumstance may harm our competitive position and business in addition the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secret and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our product result the value of our investment in product development and marketing could be reduced our license with other company and participation in industry initiative may allow competitor to use our patent right technology company often bilaterally license patent between each other to settle dispute or part of business agreement our competitor may have license to our patent and under current case law some of the license may exhaust our patent right to licensed product sale under some circumstance our participation in industry standard organization or with other industry initiative may require to license our patent to company that adopt industry standard specification depending on the rule of the organization government regulation or court decision we might have to grant license to our patent for little or no cost and result we may be unable to enforce certain patent against others our cost of enforcing our license or protecting our patent may increase and the value of our ip right may be impaired third party may assert claim based on ip right against or our product which could harm our business we may face claim based on ip right from individual and company including claim from those who have aggregated patent acquired from multiple source to form new larger portfolio to assert claim against and other company additionally large patent portfolio owner may divest portion of their portfolio to more than one individual or company increasing the number of party who own ip right previously all held by single party we are typically engaged in number of dispute involving ip right claim that our product or process infringe the ip right of others regardless of their merit could cause to incur large cost to respond to defend and resolve the claim and they may divert the effort and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business and operation in addition we may face claim based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third party trade secret or confidential information or end user data that we obtain in conducting our business any such incident and claim could severely disrupt our business and we could suffer loss including the cost of product recall and return and reputational harm furthermore we have agreed to indemnify customer for certain ip right claim against them ip right claim against our customer could also limit demand for our product or disrupt our customer business which could in turn adversely affect our result of operation result of ip right claim we could pay monetary damage including payment to satisfy indemnification obligation or royalty stop manufacturing using selling offering to sell or importing product or technology subject to claim need to develop other product or technology not subject to claim which could be time consuming or costly and or enter into settlement and license agreement which agreement may not be available on commercially reasonable term these ip right claim could harm our competitive position result in expense or require to impair our asset if we alter or stop production of affected item our revenue could be harmed we rely on access to third party ip which may not be available to on commercially reasonable term or at all many of our product include third party technology and or implement industry standard and may require license from third party based on past experience and industry practice we believe such license generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable term however there is no assurance that the necessary license can be obtained on acceptable term or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party technology or to license ip on commercially reasonable term could preclude from selling certain product or otherwise have material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating result other key information of contentswe are subject to risk associated with litigation and regulatory proceeding we may face legal claim or regulatory matter involving stockholder consumer competition commercial ip and other issue on global basis described in note commitment and contingency within the consolidated financial statement we are engaged in number of litigation and regulatory matter litigation and regulatory proceeding are inherently uncertain and adverse ruling could occur including monetary damage or an injunction stopping from manufacturing or selling certain product engaging in certain business practice or requiring other remedy such compulsory licensing of patent an unfavorable outcome may result in material adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operation in addition regardless of the outcome litigation and regulatory proceeding can be costly time consuming disruptive to our operation and distracting to management we must attract retain and motivate key employee to be competitive we must attract retain and motivate executive and other key employee hiring and retaining qualified executive scientist engineer technical staff and sale representative are critical to our business and competition for highly skilled employee in our industry can be intense in addition change in immigration policy may impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent change in the interpretation and application of employment related law to our workforce practice may also result in increased operating cost and le flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce need to help attract retain and motivate qualified employee we use share based award such rsus and performance based cash incentive award our employee hiring and retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be viewed an employer of choice if our share based or other compensation program and workplace culture cease to be viewed competitive our ability to attract retain and motivate employee could be weakened which could harm our result of operation furthermore change in our management team may disrupt our business and the failure to successfully transition and assimilate key employee could adversely affect our result of operation we are subject to risk associated with our strategic transaction our acquisition divestiture and other strategic transaction could fail to achieve our financial or strategic objective disrupt our ongoing business and adversely impact our result of operation in furtherance of our business strategy we routinely evaluate opportunity and enter into agreement for possible acquisition divestiture and other strategic transaction these transaction involve numerous risk including we may not be able to identify opportunity in timely manner or on term acceptable to the transaction may not advance our business strategy and it anticipated benefit may never materialize we may experience disruption of our ongoing operation and our management attention may be diverted we may fail to complete transaction in timely manner if at all due to our inability to obtain required government or other approval

not adequately ensure compliance with law and regulation and we may fail to identify compliance issue or liability we may fail to identify or may underestimate commitment liability and other risk associated with acquired business or asset and or our acquisition may result in dilutive issuance of our equity security or significant additional debt moreover our resource are limited and our decision to pursue transaction ha opportunity cost accordingly if we pursue particular transaction we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transaction that could help achieve our financial or strategic objective any of these risk could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition or cash flow particularly in the case of large acquisition or several concurrent acquisition we invest in public and private company and may not realize return on our investment we make investment in public and private company around the world to further our strategic and financial objective and to support certain key business initiative company in which we invest range from early stage company still defining their strategic direction to mature company with established revenue stream and business model many of the instrument in which we invest are non marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment and we may not be able to achieve return if any in timely fashion our ability to realize return on our investment in private company if any is typically dependent on the company participating in liquidity event such public offering or acquisition to the extent our investment are in marketable equity security is typically the case for our public company investment fluctuation in the fair value of those security are recognized gain or loss in our income statement and consequently decline in the fair value of these investment can reduce our net income if any of the company in which we invest are not successful which may include failure to achieve business objective well bankruptcy filing we could recognize an impairment and or lose all or part of our investment other key information of contentswe are subject to sale related risk we face risk related to sale through distributor and other third party we sell significant portion of our product through third party such distributor value added resellers and channel partner collectively referred to distributor well oems and odms we depend on many distributor to help create end customer demand provide technical support and other value added service to customer fill customer order and stock our product we may rely on one or more key distributor for product and material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributor or their failure to perform expected could reduce our revenue our ability to add or replace distributor for some of our product may be limited in addition our distributor expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory level for some of our product may not be easily transferable to new distributor result end customer may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of distributor using third party for distribution expose to many risk including competitive pressure and concentration credit and compliance risk distributor and other third party may sell product that compete with our product and we may need to provide financial and other incentive to focus them on the sale of our product they may face financial difficulty including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of account receivable and financial result violation of the foreign corrupt practice act or similar law by distributor or other third party intermediary could have material impact on our business failure to manage risk related to our use of distributor and other third party may reduce sale increase expense and weaken our competitive position we receive significant portion of our revenue from limited number of customer collectively our three largest customer accounted for approximately of our net revenue in and of our net revenue in we expect small number of customer will continue to account for significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future industry trend such the increasing shift of data center workload to the public cloud may increase customer concentration for certain of our data centric business if one of our key customer stop purchasing from materially reduces it demand for our product or delay it order for our product we may experience reduction in revenue which could harm our result of operation and financial condition to the extent we differentiate our product through customization to meet customer specification order change delay or cancellation may result in non recoverable cost for more information about our customer including customer who accounted for greater than of our net consolidated revenue see note operating segment within the consolidated financial

policiesrevenue recognitionwe recognize net product revenue when we satisfy performance obligation evidenced by the transfer of control of our product or service to customer substantially all of our revenue is derived from product sale in accordance with contract term revenue for product sale is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facility or delivery to the customer location determined by the agreed upon shipping term prior to on sale made to distributor that allowed for price protection or right of return until the distributor sold through the merchandise we deferred product revenue and related cost of sale we include shipping charge billed to customer in net revenue and include the related shipping cost in cost of sale we measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for product or service variable consideration is estimated and reflected an adjustment to the transaction price we determine variable consideration which consists primarily of various sale price concession by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer based on historical analysis of customer purchase volume sale rebate earned by customer are offset against their receivable balance rebate earned by customer when they do not have outstanding receivable balance are recorded within other accrued liability the impact of distributor sale price reduction resulting from price protection agreement are also estimated based on historical analysis of such activity and are reflected reduction in net revenue we make payment to our customer through cooperative advertising program for marketing activity for certain of our product we generally record the payment reduction in revenue in the period that the revenue is earned unless the payment is for distinct service which we record expense when the marketing activity occur during the second half of we transitioned customer from previous offering under the intel inside program to cooperative advertising offering more tailored to customer and their marketing audience these cooperative advertising cost are recorded reduction of revenue beginning in the second half of we no longer meet the criterion for recording these expense inventorieswe compute inventory cost on first in first out basis our process and product development life cycle corresponds with substantive engineering milestone these engineering milestone are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activity and associated cost change in nature from research and development to cost of sale and when cost of sale can be capitalized inventory for product to be manufactured in high volume and sold to our customer under our standard warranty it must meet our rigorous technical quality specification this milestone is known product release qualification prq we have identified prq the point at which the cost incurred to manufacture our product are included in the valuation of inventory prior to prq cost that do not meet the criterion for are included in cost of sale in the period incurred if the point at which we estimate that inventory meet prq criterion change in the future the timing and recognition of cost would shift between inventory and cost of sale single prq ha previously ranged up to million and is dependent on product type the valuation of inventory includes determining which fixed production overhead cost can be included in inventory based on the normal capacity of our manufacturing and assembly and test facility we apply our historical loading compared to our total available capacity in statistical model to determine our normal capacity level if the factory loading are below the established normal capacity level portion of our fixed production overhead cost would not be included in the cost of inventory instead it would be recognized cost of sale in that period we refer to these cost excess capacity charge excess capacity charge are insignificant in the year presented charge in certain prior year have ranged from million to billion the high end of the range would be million when excluding the billion charge taken in connection with the economic recession financial statement note to financial of contentsinventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value based upon assumption about future demand and market condition product specific fact and circumstance reviewed in the inventory valuation process include review of our customer base the stage of the product life cycle and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost inventory reserve increased by approximately million in compared to the valuation of inventory also requires to estimate obsolete and excess inventory well inventory that is not of saleable quality we use the demand forecast to develop our short term manufacturing plan to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decision we compare the estimate of future demand to work in process and finished good inventory level to determine the amount if any of obsolete or excess inventory if our demand forecast for specific product is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly we could be required to write off inventory property plant and equipmentwe compute depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of asset we also capitalize interest on borrowing related to eligible capital expenditure capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified asset and depreciated together with that asset cost we record capital related government grant earned reduction to property plant and equipment annually we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property plant and equipment considering factor such the process technology cadence between node transition change in machinery and equipment technology and re use of machinery and tool across each generation of process technology we make manufacturing process conversion and other factory planning decision we use assumption involving the use of management judgment regarding the remaining useful life of asset primarily process specific semiconductor manufacturing tool and building improvement when we determine that the useful life of asset are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the asset revised useful life asset are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flow we ass property plant and equipment for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of the asset or the asset grouping may not be recoverable factor that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of business or product line in relation to expectation significant negative industry or economic trend and significant change or planned change in our use of the asset we measure the recoverability of asset that we will continue to use in our operation by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flow arising from the use of that asset grouping if an asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flow the asset grouping is considered to be impaired we measure the impairment by comparing the difference between the asset grouping carrying value and it fair value we may have certain facility included within construction in progress being held in safe state and not currently in use that we plan to place into service at future date the time at which these asset are placed into service depends on our existing manufacturing capacity market demand for our product and where we are in the transition of product on our roadmap management make judgment about the timing of when these facility will be readied for their intended use and placed into service for the manufacturing of our product depreciation is not recognized on these asset and they are not eligible for capitalized interest when construction is on hold fair valuewhen determining fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact well assumption that market participant would use when pricing the asset or liability our financial asset are measured and recorded at fair value on recurring basis except for equity security measured using the measurement alternative equity method investment cost method loan receivable grant receivable and reverse repurchase agreement with original maturity greater than three month we ass fair value hierarchy level for our issued debt and fixed income investment portfolio based on the underlying instrument type the three level of input that may be used to measure fair value are level quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability we evaluate security specific market data when determining whether market is active level observable input other than level price such quoted price for similar asset or liability quoted price in le active market or model derived valuation all significant input used in our valuation such discounted cash flow are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability we use libor based yield curve currency spot and forward rate and credit rating significant input in our valuation level input also include non binding market consensus price well quoted price that were adjusted for security specific restriction when we use non binding market consensus price we corroborate them with quoted market price for similar instrument or compare them to output from internally developed pricing model such discounted cash flow model level unobservable input to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of asset or liability we monitor and review the input and result of these valuation model to help ensure the fair value measurement are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset class level input also include non binding market consensus price or non binding broker quote that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data financial statement note to financial of contentsdebt investmentswe consider all highly liquid debt investment with original maturity from the date of purchase of three month or le cash equivalent cash equivalent can include investment such corporate debt financial institution instrument government debt and reverse repurchase agreement marketable debt investment are generally designated trading asset when market risk is economically hedged at inception with related derivative instrument or when the marketable debt investment is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement investment designated trading asset are reported at fair value gain or loss on these investment arising from change in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuation and credit market volatility largely offset by loss or gain on the related derivative instrument and balance sheet remeasurement are recorded in interest and other net marketable debt investment are considered available for sale investment when the interest rate and foreign currency risk are not hedged at the inception of the investment or when our criterion for designation trading asset are not met available for sale debt investment with original maturity of approximately three month or le from the date of purchase are classified within cash and cash equivalent available for sale debt investment with original maturity at the date of purchase greater than approximately three month and remaining maturity of le than one year are classified short term investment available for sale debt investment with remaining maturity beyond one year are classified other long term investment available for sale debt investment are reported at fair value with unrealized gain or loss net of tax recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss we determine the cost of the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level and record the interest income and realized gain or loss on the sale of these investment in interest and other net our available for sale debt investment are subject to periodic impairment review for these investment we consider whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investment before recovery of it amortized cost basis or whether recovery of the entire amortized cost basis of the investment is unlikely because credit loss exists when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the investment we separate other than temporary impairment into amount representing credit loss which are recognized in interest and other net and amount not related to credit loss which are recognized in other comprehensive income loss equity investmentswe regularly invest in equity security of public and private company to promote business and strategic objective equity investment are measured and recorded follows marketable equity security are equity security with readily determinable fair value rdfv that are measured and recorded at fair value on recurring basis with change in fair value whether realized or unrealized recorded through the income statement prior to these security were classified available for sale security and measured and recorded at fair value with unrealized change in fair value recorded through other comprehensive income non marketable equity security are equity security without rdfv that are measured and recorded using measurement alternative that measure the security at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus change resulting from qualifying observable price change prior to fiscal these security were accounted for using the cost method of accounting measured at cost le other than temporary impairment equity method investment are equity security in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence equity method investment are measured at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss our proportionate share of the income or loss from equity method investment is recognized on one quarter lag realized and unrealized gain and loss resulting from change in fair value or the sale of our equity investment are recorded in gain loss on equity investment net prior to we recorded unrealized gain and loss through other comprehensive income loss and realized gain and loss on the sale exchange or impairment of these equity investment through gain loss on equity investment net the carrying value of our non marketable equity security is adjusted for qualifying observable price change resulting from the issuance of similar or identical security by the same issuer determining whether an observed transaction is similar to security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the right and preference of the security recording upward and downward adjustment to the carrying value of our equity security result of observable price change requires quantitative assessment of the fair value of our security using various valuation methodology and involves the use of estimate non marketable equity security and equity method investment collectively referred to non marketable equity investment are also subject to periodic impairment review our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factor that may have significant impact on the investee fair value qualitative factor considered include the investee financial condition and business outlook industry and sector performance market for technology operational and financing cash flow activity and other relevant event and factor affecting the investee when indicator of impairment exist we prepare quantitative assessment of the fair value of our non marketable equity investment using both the market and income approach which require judgment and the use of estimate including discount rate investee revenue and cost and comparable market data of private and public company among others financial statement note to financial of content non marketable equity security are tested for impairment using qualitative model similar to the model used for goodwill and long lived asset upon determining that an impairment may exist the security fair value is calculated and compared to it carrying value and an impairment is recognized immediately if the carrying value exceeds the fair value prior to non marketable equity security were tested for impairment using the other than temporary impairment model equity method investment are subject to periodic impairment review using the other than temporary impairment model which considers the severity and duration of decline in fair value below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for sufficient period of time to allow for recovery impairment of equity investment are recorded in gain loss on equity investment net derivative financial instrumentsour primary objective for holding derivative financial instrument is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk and to lesser extent equity market risk commodity price risk and credit risk we enter into master netting arrangement to mitigate credit risk in derivative transaction by permitting net settlement of transaction with the same counterparty master netting arrangement allows counterparties to net settle amount owed to each other result of multiple separate derivative transaction we also enter into collateral security arrangement with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instrument fluctuates from contractually established threshold we record the collateral within current other asset and long term other asset with corresponding liability for presentation on our consolidated balance sheet we do not offset fair value amount recognized for derivative instrument under master netting arrangement our derivative financial instrument are presented at fair value on gross basis and are included in other current asset other long term asset other accrued liability or other long term liability cash flow hedge use foreign currency contract such currency forward and currency interest rate swap to hedge exposure for the following item variability in the dollar equivalent of non dollar denominated cash flow associated with our forecasted operating and capital purchase spending and coupon and principal payment for our non dollar

hedge use interest rate contract such interest rate swap to hedge against change in the fair value on certain of our fixed rate indebtedness attributable to change in the benchmark interest rate the gain or loss on these hedge well the offsetting loss or gain related to the change in the fair value of the underlying hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period primarily in interest and other net these derivative are classified in the consolidated statement of cash flow in the same section the underlying item primarily within cash flow from financing activity non designated hedge use foreign currency contract to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flow of recognized monetary asset and liability non dollar denominated debt instrument classified trading asset and non dollar denominated loan receivables recognized at fair value we also use interest rate contract to hedge interest rate risk related to our dollar denominated fixed rate debt instrument classified trading asset the change in fair value of these derivative is recorded through earnings in the line item on the consolidated statement of income to which the derivative most closely relate primarily in interest and other net change in the fair value of the underlying asset and liability associated with the hedged risk are generally offset by the change in the fair value of the related derivative loan receivablewe elect the fair value option when the interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk is economically hedged at the inception of the loan with related derivative instrument when the fair value option is not elected the loan are carried at amortized cost we measure interest income for all loan receivable using the interest method which is based on the effective yield of the loan rather than the stated coupon rate we classify our loan within other current and long term asset financial statement note to financial of contentscredit riskfinancial instrument that potentially subject to concentration of credit risk consist principally of investment in debt instrument derivative financial instrument loan receivable reverse repurchase agreement and trade receivables we enter into master netting arrangement to mitigate credit risk in derivative transaction by permitting net settlement of transaction with the same counterparty we generally place investment with high credit quality counterparties and by policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterparty relative credit standing required per our investment policy substantially all of our investment in debt instrument and financing receivables are in investment grade instrument credit rating criterion for derivative instrument are similar to those for other investment due to master netting arrangement the amount subject to credit risk related to derivative instrument are generally limited to the amount if any by which the counterparty obligation exceed our obligation with that counterparty of december our total credit exposure to any single counterparty excluding money market fund invested in treasury and agency security and reverse repurchase agreement collateralized by treasury and agency security did not exceed million to further reduce credit risk we obtain and secure available collateral from counterparties against obligation including security lending transaction when we deem it appropriate substantial majority of our trade receivables are derived from sale to original equipment manufacturer oems and original design manufacturer odms we also have account receivable derived from sale to industrial and communication equipment manufacturer in the computing and communication industry we believe that the net account receivable balance from our three largest customer of december do not represent significant credit risk based on cash flow forecast balance sheet analysis and past collection experience for more information about the customer that represent our account receivable balance see note operating segment we have adopted credit policy and standard intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk we believe that credit risk are moderated by the financial stability of our major customer we ass credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis from this analysis we establish shipping and credit limit and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection device such obtaining parent guarantee standby letter of credit or credit insurance business combinationswe allocate the purchase price paid for asset acquired and liability assumed in connection with our acquisition based on their estimated fair value at the time of acquisition this allocation involves number of assumption estimate and judgment that could materially affect the timing or amount recognized in our financial statement the most subjective area include determining the fair value of the following intangible asset including the valuation methodology estimation of future cash flow discount rate market segment growth rate and our assumed market segment share well the estimated useful life of intangible asset deferred tax asset and liability uncertain tax position and tax related valuation allowance which are initially estimated of the acquisition date inventory property plant and equipment pre existing liability or legal claim deferred revenue and contingent consideration each may be applicable and goodwill measured the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair value of the asset acquired and the liability assumed our assumption and estimate are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired company we allocate goodwill to the reporting unit of the business that are expected to benefit from the business combination goodwillwe perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicator of potential impairment exist the analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factor to ass the likelihood of an impairment the reporting unit carrying value used in an impairment test represents the assignment of various asset and liability excluding certain corporate asset and liability such cash investment and debt qualitative factor include industry and market consideration overall financial

applying sensitivity to assumption and input used in measuring reporting unit fair value our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate reporting unit fair value significant estimate include market segment growth rate our assumed market segment share estimated cost and discount rate based on reporting unit weighted average cost of

the fair value of incomplete project that had not reached technological feasibility of the date of acquisition initially these are classified in process and are not subject to amortization once these project are completed the asset balance are transferred from in process to acquisition related developed technology and are subject to amortization from this point forward the asset balance relating to project that are abandoned after acquisition are impaired and expensed to we perform quarterly review of significant finite lived identified intangible asset to determine whether fact and circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable these review can be affected by various factor including external factor such industry and economic trend and internal factor such change in our business strategy and our forecast for specific product line employee equity incentive planswe use the straight line amortization method to recognize share based compensation expense

eliminate deferred tax asset for option and rsus with multiple vesting date for each vesting period on first in first out basis if each vesting period were separate award income taxeswe compute the provision for income tax using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax asset and liability are recognized for the expected future tax consequence of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we measure deferred tax asset and liability using the currently enacted tax rate that apply to taxable income in effect for the year in which those tax asset are expected to be realized or settled we ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for tax by recording valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet recovery of portion of our deferred tax asset is affected by management plan with respect to holding or disposing of certain investment therefore such change could also affect our future provision for tax we recognize tax benefit from uncertain tax position only if based on the technical merit of the position it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authority the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement from such position are measured based on the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we recognize interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit within the provision for tax on the consolidated statement
