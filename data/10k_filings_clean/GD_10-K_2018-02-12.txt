annual report on form before deciding whether to purchase our security investment risk can be market wide well unique to specific industry or company the market risk faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainty faced by investor in broad range of industry there are some risk that apply more specifically to our business our revenue is concentrated with the government this customer relationship involves some specific risk in addition our sale to non customer expose to different financial and legal risk despite the varying nature of our and non defense and business aviation operation and the market serve each group share some common risk such the ongoing development of high technology product and the price availability and quality of commodity and subsystem the government provides significant portion of our revenue in approximately of our consolidated revenue wa from the government level of defense spending are driven by threat to national security competing demand for federal fund can pressure various area of spending decrease in government defense spending or change in spending allocation or priority could result in one or more of our program reduced delayed or terminated which could impact our financial performance for additional information relating to the defense budget see the business environment section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation in item government contract are not always fully funded at inception and any funding is subject to disruption or delay our government revenue is funded by agency budget that operate on an october to september fiscal year early each calendar year the president of the united state present to congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year this budget proposes funding level for every federal agency and is the result of month of policy and program review throughout the executive branch for the remainder of the year the appropriation and authorization committee of congress review the president budget proposal and establish the funding level for the upcoming fiscal year these level are enacted into law the executive office of the president administers the fund to the agency there are two primary risk associated with the government budget cycle first the annual process may be delayed or disrupted which ha occurred in recent year if the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year portion of the government can shut or operate under continuing resolution that maintains spending at prior year level which can impact funding for program and timing of new award second congress typically appropriates fund on fiscal year basis even though contract performance may extend over many year future revenue under existing multi year contract is conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriation change in appropriation in subsequent year may impact the funding available for these program delay or change in funding can impact the timing of available fund or lead to change in program content our government contract are subject to termination right by the customer government contract generally permit the government to terminate contract in whole or in part for convenience if contract is terminated for convenience contractor usually is entitled to receive payment for it allowable cost incurred and the proportionate share of fee or earnings for the work performed the government may also terminate contract for default in the event of breach by the contractor if contract is terminated for default the government in most case pay only for the work it ha accepted the termination of multiple or large program could have material adverse effect on our future revenue and earnings government contractor operate in highly regulated environment and are subject to audit by the government numerous government agency routinely audit and review government contractor these agency review contractor performance under it contract and compliance with applicable law regulation and standard the government also review the adequacy of and compliance with internal control system and policy including the contractor purchasing property estimating material earned value management and accounting system in some case audit may result in delayed payment or contractor cost not being reimbursed or subject to repayment if an audit or investigation were to result in allegation against contractor of improper or illegal activity civil or criminal penalty and administrative sanction could result including termination of contract forfeiture of profit suspension of payment fine and suspension or prohibition from business with the government in addition reputational harm could result if allegation of impropriety were made in some case audit may result in dispute with the respective government agency that can result in negotiated settlement arbitration or litigation moreover new law regulation or standard or change to existing one can increase our performance and compliance cost and reduce our profitability our aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft the business jet market is driven by the demand for business aviation product and service by corporate individual and government customer in the united state and around the world the aerospace group result also depend on other factor including general economic condition the availability of credit pricing pressure and trend in capital good market in addition if customer default on existing contract and the contract are not replaced the group anticipated revenue and profitability could be reduced materially earnings and margin depend on our ability to perform on our contract when agreeing to contractual term our management team make assumption and projection about future condition and event the accounting for our contract and program requires assumption and estimate about these condition and event these projection and estimate ass the productivity and availability of labor the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of material and component and schedule requirement if there is significant change in one or more of these circumstance estimate or assumption or if the risk under our contract are not managed adequately the profitability of contract could be adversely affected this could affect earnings and margin materially and margin depend in part on subcontractor and vendor performance we rely on other company to provide material component and subsystem for our product subcontractor also perform some of the service that we provide to our customer we depend on these subcontractor and vendor to meet our contractual obligation in full compliance with customer requirement and applicable law misconduct by subcontractor such failure to comply with procurement regulation or engaging in unauthorized activity may harm our future revenue and earnings we manage our supplier base carefully to avoid customer issue we sometimes rely on only one or two source of supply that if disrupted could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitment our ability to perform our obligation may be materially adversely affected if one or more of these supplier is unable to provide the agreed upon material perform the agreed upon service in timely and cost effective manner or engages in misconduct or other improper activity sale and operation outside the united state are subject to different risk that may be associated with doing business in foreign country in some country there is increased chance for economic legal or political change and procurement procedure may be le robust or mature which may complicate the contracting process our non business may be sensitive to change in foreign government budget leadership and national priority which may occur suddenly non transaction can involve increased financial and legal risk arising from foreign exchange rate variability and differing legal system our non business is subject to and foreign law and regulation including law and regulation relating to import export control technology transfer the foreign corrupt practice act and other anti corruption law and the international traffic in arm regulation itar an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factor or failure to comply with or foreign law could result in administrative civil or criminal liability including suspension or debarment from government contract or suspension of our export privilege and could materially adversely affect revenue and earnings associated with our non business in addition some non government customer require contractor to enter into letter of credit performance or surety bond bank guarantee and other similar financial arrangement we may also be required to agree to specific in country purchase manufacturing agreement or financial support arrangement known offset that require to satisfy investment or other requirement or face penalty offset requirement may extend over several year and could require to team with local company to fulfill these requirement if we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirement our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected our future success depends in part on our ability to develop new product and technology and maintain qualified workforce to meet the need of our customer many of the product and service we provide involve sophisticated technology and engineering with related complex manufacturing and system integration process our customer requirement change and evolve regularly accordingly our future performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop manufacture and provide innovative product and service and bring those offering to market quickly at cost effective price some new product particularly in our aerospace group must meet extensive and time consuming regulatory requirement that are often outside our control additionally due to the highly specialized nature of our business we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the service required by our customer if we were unable to develop new product that meet customer changing need and satisfy regulatory requirement in timely manner or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected we have made and expect to continue to make investment including acquisition and joint venture that involve risk and uncertainty when evaluating potential acquisition and joint venture make judgment regarding the value of business opportunity technology and other asset and the risk and cost of potential liability based on information available to at the time of the transaction whether we realize the anticipated benefit from these transaction depends on multiple factor including our integration of the business involved the performance of the underlying product capability or technology market condition following the acquisition and acquired liability including some that may not have been identified prior to the acquisition these factor could materially adversely affect our financial result change in business

for the csra acquisition and any associated impact business environmentwith approximately of our revenue from the government our financial performance is impacted by government spending level particularly defense spending over the past several year defense spending ha been mandated by the budget control act of bca the bca establishes spending cap over year period through on february the congress approved increase to the bca spending cap and budget for fiscal year fy and the fy defense budget total billion which includes billion in the base budget in compliance with the modified bca spending cap and billion for overseas contingency operation representing an increase of more than over fy spending level the fy defense budget total billion however federal agency and program do not receive funding at the new level until the corresponding appropriation bill are approved the congress ha not yet passed the fy defense appropriation bill result we have been operating under series of continuing resolution cr which have funded government agency at fy spending level since the beginning of the government fiscal year of the filing of this form on february the current cr signed into law on february fund the government through march we do not anticipate that these cr will have material impact on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow the long term outlook for our defense business is influenced by the relevance of our program to the military funding priority the diversity of our program and customer our insight into customer requirement stemming from our incumbency on core program our ability to evolve our product to address fast changing threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution international demand for military equipment and information technology present opportunity for our non operation and export from our north american business while the revenue potential can be significant there are risk to doing business in foreign country including changing budget priority and overall spending pressure unique to each country in our aerospace group we continue to experience strong demand across our product portfolio we expect our continued investment in the development of new aircraft product and technology to support aerospace group long term growth similarly we believe the aircraft service business will be strong source of revenue the global business jet fleet grows across our portfolio we focus on expanding operating earnings and the efficient conversion of earnings into cash we emphasize effective program execution and the flexibility and agility to respond to changing circumstance in our business environment and look for opportunity to drive cost reduction across our business result of operationsintroductionan understanding of our accounting practice is necessary in the evaluation of our financial statement and operating result the following paragraph explain how we recognize revenue and operating cost in our business group we account for revenue in accordance with accounting standard codification asc topic revenue from contract with customer which we adopted on january prior period information ha been restated for the adoption further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement in item in the aerospace group we record revenue on contract for new aircraft when the customer obtains control of the asset which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft revenue associated with the group completion of other original equipment manufacturer oems aircraft and the group service business is recognized work progress or upon delivery of service fluctuation in revenue from period to period result from the number and mix of new aircraft delivery progress on aircraft completion and the level of aircraft service activity during the period the majority of the aerospace group operating cost relate to new aircraft production on firm order and consist of labor material subcontractor and overhead cost the cost are accumulated in production lot recorded in inventory and recognized operating cost at aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in production lot while change in the estimated average unit cost for production lot impact the level of operating cost the amount of operating cost reported in given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered operating cost in the aerospace group completion and service business are recognized generally incurred for new aircraft operating earnings and margin are function of the price of our aircraft our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft and the mix of large cabin and mid cabin aircraft delivery additional factor affecting the group earnings and margin include the volume mix and profitability of completion and service work performed the volume of and market for pre owned aircraft and the level of general and administrative and net research and development cost incurred by the group in the three defense group revenue on long term government contract is recognized generally over time the work progress either the product are produced or service are rendered typically revenue is recognized over time using cost incurred to date relative to total estimated cost at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligation incurred cost represents work performed which corresponds with and thereby best depicts the transfer of control to the customer contract cost include labor material overhead and when appropriate expense variance in cost recognized from period to period reflect primarily increase and decrease in production or activity level on individual cost are used measure of progress year over year variance in cost result in corresponding variance in revenue which we generally refer to volume operating earnings and margin in the defense group are driven by change in volume performance or contract mix performance refers to change in profitability based on adjustment to estimate at completion on individual contract these adjustment result from increase or decrease to the estimated value of the contract the estimated cost to complete the contract or both therefore change in cost incurred in the period compared with prior period do not necessarily impact profitability it is only when total estimated cost at completion on given contract change without corresponding change in the contract value that the profitability of that contract may be impacted contract mix refers to change in the volume of higher versus lower margin work additionally higher or lower margin can be inherent in the contract type fixed price cost reimbursable or type of work development production consolidated overview in review outstanding operating performance revenue increased to billion with growth in our aerospace and

cabin and mid cabin aircraft delivery and decreased jones act commercial ship construction volume revenue from product increased due primarily to higher volume on the win program product operating cost decreased at lower rate than revenue declined in due to ddg program cost growth in our marine system group additionally benefited from favorable cost performance on block iii of the virginia class submarine program in our marine system group and supplier settlement received in our aerospace group the increase in service revenue in consisted of the following ship engineering repair and other service net total increase revenue increased due primarily to additional development work on the columbia class submarine program service operating cost increased in consistent with the higher volume described above expensesas percentage of revenue expense were in in and in we expect expense percentage of revenue in to be generally consistent with interest netnet interest expense wa in in and in the increase in wa due primarily to net increase in long term debt beginning in the third quarter of we expect net interest expense to be approximately the increase from is due primarily to slightly higher interest rate on the billion of fixed rate note issued in compared with the of fixed rate note that matured in see note to the consolidated financial statement in item for additional information regarding our debt obligation including interest rate other netnet other income wa in in and in in we expect net other expense to be approximately due primarily to the adoption of asu

expected to apply when the temporary difference are realized settled remeasured at rate of versus for the majority of our deferred tax asset and liability the decrease in the effective tax rate in wa due to increased international activity well excess tax benefit from equity based compensation recognized an income tax benefit in accordance with asu we adopted asu on prospective basis beginning in for further discussion including reconciliation of our effective tax rate from the statutory federal rate see note to the consolidated financial statement in item for we anticipate full year effective tax rate of approximately the expected decrease from is due primarily to the reduction of the corporate statutory tax rate from to beginning on january and the net impact of other tax reform provision notably lower tax rate on income earned from foreign sale of produced good and service however the tax reform eliminated certain tax benefit under the prior tax law including the domestic production deduction further our non business which previously provided benefit to our effective tax rate operate in jurisdiction with statutory tax rate that are now similar to the and in some case higher for these reason while we continue to expect an effective tax rate slightly the statutory rate the difference between the rate is expected to narrow under the new tax law discontinued operation net of taxin we settled litigation with the navy related to the terminated aircraft contract in the company former tactical military aircraft business in connection with the settlement we released some right

following is discussion of our major operating investing and financing activity for each of the past three year classified on the consolidated statement of cash flow in item activitieswe generated cash from operating activity of billion in billion in and billion in the primary driver of cash flow wa net earnings cash flow in and were affected negatively by growth in operating working capital in our combat system group due to the utilization of deposit and the timing of billing on large contract for middle eastern customer and in our aerospace group from the build up of inventory related to the new and aircraft program and the liquidation of customer deposit associated with aircraft delivery in the growth in operating working capital due to these factor slowed and wa offset by lower income tax payment investing activitiescash used for investing activity wa in compared with cash used for investing activity of in and cash provided by investing activity of in our investing activity include cash paid for capital expenditure and business acquisition purchase sale and maturity of marketable security and proceeds from asset sale capital expenditure the primary use of cash for

corporate purpose in we repaid of fixed rate note on their maturity date with cash on hand and issued billion of fixed rate note for general corporate purpose in we repaid of fixed rate note on their scheduled maturity date with the proceeds from maturing marketable security we have no additional material repayment of long term debt scheduled until see note to the consolidated financial statement in item for additional information regarding our debt obligation including scheduled debt maturity and interest rate on december we had no commercial paper outstanding but we maintain the ability to access the commercial paper market in the future we have billion in committed bank credit facility for general corporate purpose and working capital need these credit facility include billion multi year facility expiring in july and billion multi year facility expiring in november we may renew or replace these credit facility in whole or in part at or prior to their expiration date we also have an effective shelf registration on file with the security and exchange commission that allows to access the debt market non gaap financial measureswe emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder return described below we use free cash flow from operation and roic to measure our performance in these area while we believe these metric provide useful information they are not defined operating measure under generally accepted accounting principle gaap and there are limitation associated with their use our calculation of these metric may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measure of other company due to potential difference in the method of calculation result the use of these metric should not be considered in isolation from or substitute for other gaap measure free cash flow we define free cash flow from operation net cash provided by operating activity le capital expenditure we believe free cash flow from operation is useful measure for investor because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our business for purpose such repaying maturing debt funding business acquisition repurchasing our common stock and paying dividend we use free cash flow from operation to ass the quality of our earnings and key performance measure in evaluating management the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operation with net cash provided by operating activity classified on the consolidated statement of cash flow year ended december net cash provided by operating activity expenditure free cash flow from operation flow percentage of earnings from continuing operation net cash provided by operating free cash flow from prior period information for and ha not been restated for asc topic and is therefore not comparable to the and information on invested capital we believe roic is useful measure for investor because it reflects our ability to generate return from the capital we have deployed in our operation we use roic to evaluate investment decision and performance measure in evaluating management we define roic net operating profit after tax divided by average invested capital net operating profit after tax is defined earnings from continuing operation plus after tax interest and amortization expense average invested capital is defined the sum of the average debt and shareholder equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss roic excludes goodwill impairment and non economic accounting change they are not reflective of company performance roic is calculated

consolidated financial statement in item for discussion of long term debt includes amount committed under legally enforceable agreement for good and service with defined term to quantity price and timing of delivery this amount includes billion of purchase obligation for product and service to be delivered under firm government contract under which we would expect full recourse under normal contract termination clause represents other long term liability on our consolidated balance sheet including the current portion of these liability the projected timing of cash flow associated with these obligation is based on management estimate which are based largely on historical experience this amount also includes all liability under our defined benefit retirement plan see note to the consolidated financial statement in item for information regarding these liability and the plan asset available to satisfy them amount of commitment expiration by periodcommercial commitmentstotal amount committed le than year year year more than yearsletters of credit and guarantee trade in option see note to the consolidated financial statement in item for discussion of letter of credit and aircraft trade in option application of critical accounting policiesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation is based on our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statement in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability and the disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement well the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimate including most pervasively those related to various assumption and projection for our long term contract and program other significant estimate include those related to goodwill and intangible asset income tax pension and other post retirement benefit worker compensation warranty obligation and litigation and other contingency we employ judgment in making our estimate but they are based on historical experience currently available information and various other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance these estimate form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily available from other source actual result could differ from these estimate we believe our judgment is applied consistently and produce financial information that fairly depicts the result of operation for all period presented in our opinion the following policy are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application revenue the majority of our revenue is derived from long term contract and program that can span several year we account for revenue in accordance with asc topic the unit of account in asc topic is performance obligation contract transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized revenue when or the performance obligation is satisfied our performance obligation are satisfied over time work progress or at point in time substantially all of our revenue in the defense group is recognized over time because control is transferred continuously to our customer typically revenue is recognized over time using cost incurred to date relative to total estimated cost at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligation incurred cost represents work performed which corresponds with and thereby best depicts the transfer of control to the customer contract cost include labor material overhead and when appropriate expense the majority of our revenue recognized at point in time is for the manufacture of business jet aircraft in our aerospace group revenue on these contract is recognized when the customer obtains control of the asset which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft accounting for long term contract and program involves the use of various technique to estimate total contract revenue and cost for long term contract we estimate the profit on contract the difference the total estimated revenue and expected cost to complete contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract contract estimate are based on various assumption to project the outcome of future event that often span several year these assumption include labor productivity and availability the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of material the performance of subcontractor and the availability and timing of funding from the customer the nature of our contract give rise to several type of variable consideration including claim and award and incentive fee we include in our contract estimate additional revenue for submitted contract modification or claim against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim the amount can be estimated reliably and it realization is probable in evaluating these criterion we consider the contractual legal basis for the claim the cause of any additional cost incurred the reasonableness of those cost and the objective evidence available to support the claim we include award or incentive fee in the estimated transaction price when there is basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee these estimate are based on historical award experience anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time because of our certainty in estimating these amount they are included in the transaction price of our contract and the associated remaining performance obligation significant change in one or more of these estimate could affect the profitability of our contract we review and update our contract related estimate regularly we recognize adjustment in estimated profit on contract under the cumulative catch up method under this method the impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified revenue and profit in future period of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate the aggregate impact of adjustment in contract estimate increased our operating earnings and diluted earnings per share by in in and in while no adjustment on any one contract wa material to our consolidated financial statement in or the amount in wa negatively impacted by loss on the design and development phase of the ajax program in our combat system group and cost growth associated with the restart of the navy ddg program in our marine system group consistent with industry practice we classify asset and liability related to long term contract current even though some of these amount may not be realized within one year the timing of revenue recognition billing and cash collection result in billed account receivable unbilled receivables contract asset and customer advance and deposit contract liability on the consolidated balance sheet these asset and liability are reported on the consolidated balance sheet on contract by contract basis at the end of each reporting period long lived asset and goodwill we review long lived asset including intangible asset subject to amortization for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we ass the recoverability of the carrying value of asset held for use based on review of undiscounted projected cash flow impairment loss where identified are measured the excess of the carrying value of the long lived asset over it estimated fair value determined by discounted projected cash flow goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible asset acquired we review goodwill for impairment annually or when circumstance indicate that an impairment is more likely than not such circumstance include significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting unit or decision to dispose of reporting unit or significant portion of reporting unit the test for goodwill impairment is two step process that requires significant level of and use of judgment by management particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting unit we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit based primarily on the discounted projected cash flow of the underlying operation this requires numerous assumption including the timing of work embedded in our backlog our performance and profitability under our contract our success in securing future business the appropriate risk adjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flow and terminal value growth and earnings rate applied to the final year of projected cash flow due to the variable inherent in our estimate of fair value difference in assumption may have material effect on the result of our impairment analysis to ass the reasonableness of our discounted projected cash flow we compare the sum of our reporting unit fair value to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the market capitalization over the sum of the reporting unit fair value additionally we evaluate the reasonableness of each reporting unit fair value by comparing the fair value to comparable peer company and recent comparable market transaction we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test of december the first step of the goodwill impairment test compare the fair value of each of our reporting unit to it carrying value our reporting unit are consistent with our business group the estimated fair value of each of our reporting unit wa well in excess of it respective carrying value of december commitment and contingency we are subject to litigation and other legal proceeding arising either from the normal course of business or under provision relating to the protection of the environment estimating liability and cost associated with these matter requires the use of judgment we record charge against earnings when liability associated with claim or pending or threatened litigation is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matter may change further fact and circumstance become known other contract cost other contract cost represent amount that are not currently allocable to government contract such portion of our estimated worker compensation obligation other insurance related assessment pension and other post retirement benefit and environmental expense these cost will become allocable to contract generally after they are paid we have elected to defer these cost in other current asset on the consolidated balance sheet until they can be allocated to contract we expect to recover these cost through ongoing business including existing backlog and probable follow on contract we regularly ass the probability of recovery of these cost this assessment requires that we make assumption about future contract cost the extent of cost recovery under our contract and the amount of future contract activity these estimate are based on our best judgment if the backlog in the future doe not support the continued deferral of these cost the profitability of our remaining contract could be adversely affected retirement plan our defined benefit pension and other post retirement benefit cost and obligation depend on several assumption and estimate the key assumption include interest rate used to discount estimated future liability and projected long term rate of return on plan asset we base the discount rate on current yield curve developed from portfolio of high quality fixed income investment with maturity consistent with the projected benefit payout period beginning in we refined the method used to determine the service and interest cost component of our net annual benefit cost previously the cost wa determined using single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve described above under the refined method known the spot rate approach we use individual spot rate along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each service cost and discounted benefit obligation payment we believe this change provides more precise measurement of service and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected service cost and discounted benefit obligation cash outflow and spot rate on the yield curve we accounted for this change prospectively change in accounting estimate we determine the long term rate of return on asset based on consideration of historical and forward looking return and the current and expected asset allocation strategy in we decreased the expected long term rate of return on asset in our primary government and commercial pension plan by basis point following an assessment of the historical and expected long term return of our various asset class these retirement plan assumption are based on our best judgment including consideration of current and future market condition in the event any of the assumption change pension and other post retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease for further discussion including the impact of hypothetical change in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan asset see note to the consolidated financial statement in item discussed under other contract cost our contractual arrangement with the government provide for the recovery of benefit cost for our government retirement plan we have elected to defer recognition of the benefit cost until such cost can be allocated to contract therefore the impact of annual change in financial reporting assumption on the retirement benefit cost for these plan doe not immediately affect our operating result accounting standard update see note to the consolidated financial statement in item for information regarding accounting standard we adopted in and other new accounting standard that have been issued by the financial accounting standard board fasb but are not effective until after december quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskwe are exposed to market risk primarily from foreign currency exchange rate interest rate commodity price and investment see note to the consolidated financial statement in item for discussion of these risk the following quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate we had notional forward exchange contract outstanding of billion on december and billion on december in we changed our method for calculating the hypothetical incremental pretax gain loss to measure the net gain loss for each currency pair across our portfolio of forward exchange contract canadian dollar dollar rather than measure the gain loss on contract by contract basis the underlying portfolio and the associated exchange rate risk have not changed we restated the amount under the new method to provide comparability between and unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of forward exchange contract would have resulted in the following hypothetical incremental pretax gain loss dollar in million currency our exchange rate sensitivity relates primarily to change in the canadian dollar euro and british pound exchange rate these loss would be offset by corresponding gain in the remeasurement of the underlying transaction being hedged we believe these foreign currency forward contract and the offsetting underlying commitment when taken together do not create material market risk interest rate risk our financial instrument subject to interest rate risk include fixed rate long term debt obligation and variable rate commercial paper on december we had billion par value of fixed rate debt and no commercial paper outstanding our fixed rate debt obligation are not putable and we do not trade these security in the market unfavorable interest rate movement would not have material impact on the fair value of our debt obligation investment risk our investment policy allows for purchase of fixed income security with an investment grade rating and maximum maturity of up to five year on december we held billion in cash and equivalent but held

security on december or cash flow in and were affected negatively by growth in operating working capital in our combat system group due to the utilization of deposit and the timing of billing on large contract for middle eastern customer and in our aerospace group from the build up of inventory related to the new and aircraft program and the liquidation of customer deposit associated with aircraft delivery in the growth in operating working capital due to these factor slowed and wa offset by lower income tax payment other contract cost other contract cost represent amount that are not currently allocable to government contract such portion of our estimated worker compensation obligation other insurance related assessment pension and other post retirement benefit and environmental expense these cost will become allocable to contract generally after they are paid we expect to recover these cost through ongoing business including existing backlog and probable follow on contract if the backlog in the future doe not support the continued deferral of these cost the profitability of our remaining contract could be adversely affected other contract cost on december and were and respectively and are included in other current asset on the consolidated balance sheet long lived asset and goodwill we review long lived asset including intangible asset subject to amortization for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we ass the recoverability of the carrying value of asset held for use based on review of undiscounted projected cash flow impairment loss where identified are measured the excess of the carrying value of the long lived asset over it estimated fair value determined by discounted projected cash flow review goodwill for impairment annually or when circumstance indicate that an impairment is more likely than not goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible asset acquired the test for goodwill impairment is two step process to first identify potential goodwill impairment for each reporting unit and if necessary measure the amount of the impairment loss our reporting unit are consistent with our business group in note we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test of december the first step of the goodwill impairment test compare the fair value of each of our reporting unit to it carrying value we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit based primarily on the discounted projected cash flow of the underlying operation the estimated fair value of each of our reporting unit wa well in excess of it respective carrying value of december for summary of our goodwill by reporting unit see note accounting standard update on january we retrospectively adopted the following accounting standard issued by the financial accounting standard board fasb that impacted our prior period financial statement asc topic revenue from contract with customer asu income tax topic balance sheet classification of deferred taxessee note for further discussion of each of these accounting standard we also adopted asu income tax topic intra entity transfer of asset other than inventory on january we recognized the cumulative effect of this standard decrease to retained earnings on the date of adoption asu requires recognition of the current and deferred income tax effect of an intra entity asset transfer other than inventory when the transfer occurs opposed to former gaap which required company to defer the income tax effect of intra entity asset transfer until the asset wa sold to an outside party the income tax effect of intra entity inventory transfer will continue to be deferred until the inventory is sold there are several new accounting standard that have been issued by the fasb but are not effective until after december including the following asu financial instrument overall subtopic recognition and measurement of financial asset and financial liability asu address certain aspect of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instrument specific to our business asu requires equity investment to be measured at fair value with change in fair value recognized in net income the asu eliminates the available for sale classification for equity investment that recognized change in fair value component of other comprehensive income we adopted the standard on modified retrospective basis with cumulative effect adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet on january the adoption of the asu did not have material effect on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow asu statement of cash flow topic classification of certain cash receipt and cash payment asu is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipt and cash payment are presented and classified in the consolidated statement of cash flow by providing guidance on eight specific cash flow issue we adopted the standard retrospectively on january the adoption of the asu did not have material effect on our cash flow asu compensation retirement benefit topic improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost asu requires the service cost component of net benefit cost to be reported separately from the other component of net benefit cost in the income statement the asu also allows only the service cost component of net benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization we adopted the standard retrospectively on january our reported operating earnings when restated will increase due to the reclassification of the non service cost component of net benefit cost and our reported other income will decrease by the same amount with no impact to net earnings the area of the asu related to capitalization did not have material effect on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow asu lease topic asu requires the recognition of lease right and obligation asset and liability on the balance sheet previously lessee were not required to recognize on the balance sheet asset and liability arising from operating lease the asu also requires disclosure of key information about leasing arrangement asu is effective on january using modified retrospective method of adoption of january in january the fasb issued an exposure draft of the proposed asu lease topic targeted improvement the proposed asu provides an alternative transition method of adoption permitting the recognition of cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings on the date of adoption we intend to adopt the standard on the effective date but have not yet selected transition method we are currently evaluating our population of leased asset in order to ass the impact of the asu on our lease portfolio and designing and implementing new process and control until this effort is completed we can not determine the effect of the asu on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow asu derivative and hedging topic targeted improvement to accounting for hedging activity asu is intended to simplify hedge accounting by better aligning an entity financial reporting for hedging relationship with it risk management activity the asu also simplifies the application of the hedge accounting guidance asu is effective on january with early adoption permitted for cash flow hedge existing at the adoption date the standard requires adoption on modified retrospective basis with cumulative effect adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet of the beginning of the year of adoption the amendment to presentation guidance and disclosure requirement are required to be adopted prospectively we have not yet determined the effect of the asu on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow have we selected transition date subsequent event on february we announced that we had entered into definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding share of csra for per share in cash the transaction is valued at billion including the assumption of billion in csra debt we anticipate financing the transaction through combination of available cash and new debt financing we will commence cash tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding share of csra common stock the tender offer is subject to customary condition including antitrust clearance and the tender of majority of the outstanding share of csra common stock we expect to complete the acquisition in the first half of revenuethe majority of our revenue is derived from long term contract and program that can span several year we account for revenue in accordance with asc topic performance obligation performance obligation is promise in contract to transfer distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in asc topic contract transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized revenue when or the performance obligation is satisfied the majority of our contract have single performance obligation the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately identifiable from other promise in the contract and is therefore not distinct some of our contract have multiple performance obligation most commonly due to the contract covering multiple phase of the product lifecycle development production maintenance support for contract with multiple performance obligation we allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus margin approach under which we forecast our expected cost of satisfying performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service contract modification are routine in the performance of our contract contract are often modified to account for change in contract specification or requirement in most instance contract modification are for good or service that are not distinct and therefore are accounted for part of the existing contract our performance obligation are satisfied over time work progress or at point in time revenue from product and service transferred to customer over time accounted for of our revenue in in and in substantially all of our revenue in the defense group is recognized over time because control is transferred continuously to our customer typically revenue is recognized over time using cost incurred to date relative to total estimated cost at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligation incurred cost represents work performed which corresponds with and thereby best depicts the transfer of control to the customer contract cost include labor material overhead and when appropriate expense revenue from good and service transferred to customer at point in time accounted for of our revenue in in and in the majority of our revenue recognized at point in time is for the manufacture of business jet aircraft in our aerospace group revenue on these contract is recognized when the customer obtains control of the asset which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft on december we had billion of remaining performance obligation which we also refer to total backlog we expect to recognize approximately of our remaining performance obligation revenue in an additional by and the balance thereafter contract estimate accounting for long term contract and program involves the use of various technique to estimate total contract revenue and cost for long term contract we estimate the profit on contract the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected cost to complete contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract contract estimate are based on various assumption to project the outcome of future event that often span several year these assumption include labor productivity and availability the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of material the performance of subcontractor and the availability and timing of funding from the customer the nature of our contract give rise to several type of variable consideration including claim and award and incentive fee we include in our contract estimate additional revenue for submitted contract modification or claim against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim the amount can be estimated reliably and it realization is probable in evaluating these criterion we consider the contractual legal basis for the claim the cause of any additional cost incurred the reasonableness of those cost and the objective evidence available to support the claim we include award or incentive fee in the estimated transaction price when there is basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee these estimate are based on historical award experience anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time because of our certainty in estimating these amount they are included in the transaction price of our contract and the associated remaining performance obligation significant change in one or more of these estimate could affect the profitability of our contract we review and update our contract related estimate regularly we recognize adjustment in estimated profit on contract under the cumulative catch up method under this method the impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified revenue and profit in future period of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate if at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract we recognize the total loss in the period it is identified the impact of adjustment in contract estimate on our operating earnings can be reflected in either operating cost and expense or revenue the aggregate impact of adjustment in contract estimate increased our revenue operating earnings and diluted earnings per share follows year ended december earnings per share no adjustment on any one contract wa material to our consolidated financial statement in or the amount in wa negatively impacted by loss on the design and development phase of the ajax program in our combat system group and cost growth associated with the restart of the navy ddg program in our marine system group revenue by category our portfolio of product and service consists

fixed price reimbursement and revenue of these contract type present advantage and disadvantage typically we assume more risk with fixed price contract however these type of contract offer additional profit when we complete the work for le than originally estimated cost reimbursement contract generally subject to lower risk accordingly the associated base fee are usually lower than fee earned on fixed price contract under time and material contract our profit may vary if actual labor hour rate vary significantly from the negotiated rate also because these contract can provide little or no fee for managing material cost the content mix can impact profitability by customer wa follows year ended december combat system information system and technology marine system totalrevenueu government

billed work progress in accordance with agreed upon contractual term either at periodic interval biweekly or monthly or upon achievement of contractual milestone generally billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition resulting in contract asset however we sometimes receive advance or deposit from our customer particularly on our international contract before revenue is recognized resulting in contract liability these asset and liability are reported on the consolidated balance sheet on contract by contract basis at the end of each reporting period in our aerospace group we generally receive deposit from customer upon contract execution and upon achievement of contractual milestone these deposit are liquidated revenue is recognized change in the contract asset and liability

yield and quoted price for similar asset and liability income taxesincome tax provision we calculate our provision for federal state and international income tax based on current tax law the tax cut and job act tax reform wa enacted on december and ha several key provision impacting accounting for and reporting of income tax the most significant provision reduces the corporate statutory tax rate from to beginning on january although most provision of tax reform are not effective until we are required to record the effect of change in tax law in the period of enactment the provision for income tax and effective tax rate in included unfavorable impact from the change in tax law the impact is due primarily to the remeasurement of our federal deferred tax asset and liability at the tax rate expected to apply when the temporary difference are realized settled remeasured at rate of versus for the majority of our deferred tax asset and liability the other key provision that requires recognition in the period of enactment is the one time toll charge resulting from the mandatory deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign taxable income it relates to our operation there wa no impact in from the mandatory deemed repatriation we had no net undistributed foreign taxable income subject to the toll charge we have obtained and analyzed all necessary information to record the effect of the change in tax law and do not anticipate reporting additional tax effect in the future however should the internal revenue service irs issue further guidance or interpretation of relevant aspect of the new tax law we may adjust these amount following is summary of our net provision for income tax for continuing operation year ended december federal for enacted change in tax total for income tax net income tax payment reported tax provision differs from the amount paid because some income and expense item are recognized in different time period for financial reporting than for income tax purpose state and local income tax allocable to government contract are included in operating cost and expense in the consolidated statement of earnings and therefore are not included in

dynamic corporation received civil investigative demand from the department of justice regarding an investigation of potential false claim act violation relating to alleged failure of electric boat quality system with respect to allegedly non conforming part purchased from supplier in electric boat wa made aware that it is defendant in lawsuit related to this matter filed under seal in district court also in the suspending and debarring official for the department of the navy issued show cause letter to electric boat requesting that electric boat respond to the official concern regarding electric boat oversight and management with respect to it quality assurance system for subcontractor and supplier electric boat responded to the show cause letter and ha been engaged in discussion with the government given the current status of these matter we are unable to express view regarding the ultimate outcome or if the outcome is adverse to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss depending on the outcome of these matter there could be material impact on our result of operation financial condition and cash flow additionally various other claim and legal proceeding incidental to the normal course of business are pending or threatened against these other matter relate to such issue government investigation and claim the protection of the environment asbestos related claim and employee related matter the nature of litigation is such that we can not predict the outcome of these other matter however based on information currently available we believe any potential liability in these other proceeding individually or in the aggregate will not have material impact on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow environmentalwe are subject to and affected by variety of federal state local and foreign environmental law and regulation we are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigation or remediation at some of our current and former facility and third party site that we do not own but where we have been designated potentially responsible party prp by the environmental protection agency or state environmental agency based on historical experience we expect that significant percentage of the total remediation and compliance cost associated with these facility will continue to be allowable contract cost and therefore recoverable under government contract required we provide financial assurance for certain site undergoing or subject to investigation or remediation we accrue environmental cost when it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated where applicable we seek insurance recovery for cost related to environmental liability we do not record insurance recovery before collection is considered probable based on all known fact and analysis we do not believe that our liability at any individual site or in the aggregate arising from such environmental condition will be material to our result of operation financial condition or cash flow we also do not believe that the range of reasonably possible additional loss beyond what ha been recorded would be material to our result of operation financial condition or cash flow minimum lease paymentstotal expense under operating lease wa in in and in operating lease are primarily for facility and equipment future minimum lease payment are follows year ended december minimum lease payment contract government contractor we are subject to government audit and investigation relating to our operation including claim for fine penalty and compensatory and treble damage we believe the outcome of such ongoing government audit and investigation will not have material impact on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow in the performance of our contract we routinely request contract modification that require additional funding from the customer most often these request are due to customer directed change in the scope of work while we are entitled to recovery of these cost under our contract the administrative process with our customer may be protracted based on the circumstance we periodically file request for equitable adjustment reas that are sometimes converted into claim in some case these request are disputed by our customer we believe our outstanding modification reas and other claim will be resolved without material impact to our result of operation financial condition or cash flow letter of credit and guarantee in the ordinary course of business we have entered into letter of credit bank guarantee surety bond and other similar arrangement with financial institution and insurance carrier totaling approximately billion on december in addition

order for new aircraft in funded contract backlog our aerospace group ha outstanding option with some customer to trade in aircraft partial consideration in their new aircraft transaction these trade in commitment are generally structured to establish the fair market value of the trade in aircraft at date generally or fewer day preceding delivery of the new aircraft to the customer at that time the customer is required to either exercise the option or allow it expiration any excess of the pre established trade in price above the fair market value at the time the new aircraft is delivered is treated reduction of revenue in the new aircraft sale transaction agreement approximately one fifth of the employee of our subsidiary work under collectively bargained term and condition including collective agreement that we have negotiated directly with union and work council number of these agreement expire within any given year historically we have been successful at renegotiating these labor agreement without any material disruption of operating activity in we expect to negotiate the term of agreement covering approximately employee we do not expect the renegotiations will either individually or in the aggregate have material impact on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow product warranty we provide warranty to our customer associated with certain product sale we record estimated warranty cost in the period in which the related product are delivered the warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date is generally based on the number of month of

dividend we determine the above assumption based on the following expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over period equal to the expected term of the option expected term is based on assumption used by set of comparable peer company risk free interest rate is the yield on treasury zero coupon issue with remaining term equal to the expected term of the

benefit we provide eligible employee the opportunity to participate in defined contribution saving plan commonly known plan which permit contribution on before tax and after tax basis employee may contribute to various investment alternative in most of these plan we match portion of the employee contribution our contribution to these plan totaled in in and in the defined contribution plan held approximately million and million share of our common stock representing approximately of our outstanding share on december and respectively pension benefit we have seven noncontributory and five contributory trusteed qualified defined benefit pension plan covering eligible government business employee and two noncontributory and four contributory plan covering eligible commercial business employee including some employee of our international operation the primary factor affecting the benefit earned by participant in our pension plan are employee year of service and compensation level our primary government pension plan which comprise the majority of our unfunded obligation were closed to new salaried participant on january additionally we made change to these plan for certain participant effective in that limit or cease the benefit that accrue for future service we made similar change to our primary commercial pension plan in we also sponsor one funded and several unfunded non qualified supplemental executive retirement plan which provide participant with additional benefit including excess benefit over limit imposed on qualified plan by federal tax law other post retirement benefit we maintain plan that provide post retirement healthcare and life insurance coverage for certain employee and retiree these benefit vary by employment status age service and salary level at retirement the coverage provided and the extent to which the retiree share in the cost of the program vary throughout the company the plan provide health and life insurance benefit to those employee retire directly from our service and not to those who terminate service prior to eligibility for retirement contribution and benefit paymentsit is our policy to fund our defined benefit retirement plan in manner that optimizes the tax deductibility and contract recovery of contribution considered within our capital deployment framework therefore we may make discretionary contribution in addition to the required contribution determined in accordance with irs regulation we contributed to our pension plan in in our required contribution are approximately we maintain several tax advantaged account primarily voluntary employee beneficiary association veba trust to fund the obligation for some of our other post retirement benefit plan for non funded plan claim are paid received contribution to our other post retirement plan were not material in and are not expected to be material in we expect the following benefit to be paid from our retirement plan over the next year pensionbenefits other post contract considerationsour contractual arrangement with the government provide for the recovery of contribution to our pension and other post retirement benefit plan covering employee working in our defense business group for non funded plan our government contract allow to recover claim paid following payment these recoverable amount are allocated to contract and billed to the customer in accordance with the cost accounting standard ca and specific contractual term for some of these plan the cumulative pension and other post retirement benefit cost exceeds the amount currently allocable to contract to the extent recovery of the cost is considered probable based on our backlog and probable follow on contract we defer the excess in other contract cost in other current asset on the consolidated balance sheet until the cost is allocable to contract see note for discussion of our other contract cost for other plan the amount allocated to contract and included in revenue ha exceeded the plan cumulative benefit cost we have deferred recognition of these excess earnings on the consolidated balance sheet defined benefit retirement plan summary financial informationestimating retirement plan asset liability and cost requires the extensive use of actuarial assumption these include the long term rate of return on plan asset the interest rate used to discount projected benefit payment healthcare cost trend rate and future salary increase given the long term nature of the assumption being made actual outcome can and often do differ from these estimate our annual benefit cost consists of three primary element the cost of benefit earned by employee for service rendered during the year an interest charge on our plan liability and an assumed return on our plan asset for the year the annual cost also includes gain and loss resulting from change in actuarial difference between the actual and assumed long term rate of return on asset and gain and loss resulting from change we make to plan benefit term we recognize an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet equal to the funded status of each of our defined benefit retirement plan the funded status is the difference between the fair value of the plan asset and it benefit obligation change in plan asset and liability due to difference between actuarial assumption and the actual result of the plan are deferred in ocl rather than charged to earnings these difference are then amortized over future year component of our annual benefit cost we amortize actuarial difference under qualified plan on straight line basis over the average remaining service period of eligible employee if all of plan participant are inactive we amortize these difference over the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participant we recognize the difference between the actual and expected return on plan asset for qualified plan over five year the deferral of these difference reduces the volatility of our annual benefit cost that can result either from year to year change in the assumption or from actual result that are not necessarily representative of the long term financial position of these plan we recognize difference under nonqualified plan immediately net annual defined benefit pension and other post retirement benefit cost credit consisted of the

and some of our pension plan had an abo that exceeded the plan asset summary information for those plan follows december abo fair value of plan plan assumptionswe calculate the plan asset and liability for given year and the net annual benefit cost for the subsequent year using assumption determined of december of the year in question following table summarizes the weighted average assumption used to determine our benefit obligation assumption on december benefit benefit obligation discount rate of increase in compensation other post retirement benefit benefit obligation discount healthcare cost trend rate trend rate for next ultimate trend year rate reach ultimate trend following table summarizes the weighted average assumption used to determine our net annual benefit cost assumption for year ended december benefit discount rate benefit service interest expected long term rate of return on rate of increase in compensation other post retirement benefit discount rate benefit service interest expected long term rate of return on not applicable we changed to the spot rate approach beginning in further described below we base the discount rate on current yield curve developed from portfolio of high quality fixed income investment with maturity consistent with the projected benefit payout period beginning in we refined the method used to determine the service and interest cost component of our net annual benefit cost previously the cost wa determined using single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve described above under the refined method known the spot rate approach we use individual spot rate along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each service cost and discounted benefit obligation payment we believe this change provides more precise measurement of service and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected service cost and discounted benefit obligation cash outflow and corresponding spot rate on the yield curve we accounted for this change prospectively change in accounting estimate we determine the long term rate of return on asset based on consideration of historical and forward looking return and the current and expected asset allocation strategy in we decreased the expected long term rate of return on asset in our primary government and commercial pension plan by point following an assessment of the historical and expected long term return of our various asset class retirement plan assumption are based on our best judgment including consideration of current and future market condition change in these estimate impact future pension and other post retirement benefit cost discussed above we defer recognition of the cumulative benefit cost for our government plan in excess of cost allocated to contract and included in revenue therefore the impact of annual change in financial reporting assumption on the cost for these plan doe not immediately affect our operating result for our pension plan that represent the majority of our total obligation the following hypothetical change in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan asset would have had the following impact in basis point basis pointsincrease decrease to net pension cost from change in discount rate in long term rate of return on plan asset basis point change in these assumed rate would not have had measurable impact on the benefit cost for our other post retirement plan in for our healthcare plan the effect of increase or decrease in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate on the net annual benefit cost is and respectively and the effect on the december accumulated other post retirement benefit obligation is and respectively plan
