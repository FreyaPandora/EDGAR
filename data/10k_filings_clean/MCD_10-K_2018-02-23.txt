including our developmental licensee and affiliate yet we have limited influence over their operation our restaurant margin arise from two source fee from franchised restaurant rent and royalty based on percentage of sale and to lesser degree sale from company operated restaurant our franchisees manage their business independently and therefore are responsible for the day to day operation of their restaurant the revenue we realize from franchised restaurant are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sale if our franchisees do not experience sale growth our revenue and margin could be negatively affected result also if sale trend worsen for franchisees their financial result may deteriorate which could result in among other thing restaurant closure or delayed or reduced payment to our refranchising effort will continue to increase that dependence and the potential effect of those factor our success also increasingly depends on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees and affiliate to implement major initiative which may include financial investment and to remain aligned with on operating promotional and capital intensive reinvestment plan franchisees ability to contribute to the achievement of our plan is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rate and may be negatively impacted by the financial market in general or by the creditworthiness of our franchisees or the company our operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problem or project an image inconsistent with our brand and value particularly if our contractual and other right and remedy are limited costly to exercise or subjected to litigation and potential delay if franchisees do not successfully operate restaurant in manner consistent with our required standard our brand image and reputation could be harmed which in turn could hurt our business and operating result our ownership mix also affect our result and financial condition the decision to own restaurant or to operate under franchise or license agreement is driven by many factor whose interrelationship is complex and changing our ability to achieve the benefit of our refranchising strategy which involves significant percentage of franchised restaurant including an increased number of restaurant run by developmental licensee and affiliate depends on various factor those factor include whether we have effectively selected franchisees licensee and or affiliate that meet our rigorous standard and whether their performance and the resulting ownership mix support our brand and financial objective challenge with respect to talent management could harm our business effective succession planning is important to our long term success failure to effectively identify develop and retain key personnel recruit high quality candidate and ensure smooth
