foreseeable future total industrial and general service sale increased in when compared to the growth rate wa modest when compared to historical period seasonality and the impact of weatherregulated utility cost and revenue are influenced by seasonal pattern peak sale of electricity occur during the summer and winter month resulting in higher revenue and cash flow in these period by contrast lower sale of electricity occur during the spring and fall allowing for scheduled plant maintenance peak gas sale occur during the winter month residential and general service customer are impacted by weather estimated weather impact are based on actual current period weather compared to normal weather condition normal weather condition are defined the long term average of actual historical weather condition the estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the temperature variance from normal condition and customer historic usage level and pattern the methodology used to estimate the impact of weather not consider all variable that may impact customer response to weather condition such humidity in the summer or wind chill in the winter the precision of this estimate may also be impacted by applying long term weather trend to shorter term period degree day data are used to estimate energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperature based on each day average

service are priced by state commission approved rate designed to include the cost of providing these service and reasonable return on invested capital this regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable electricity at fair price competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the development and deployment of alternative energy source including on site generation from industrial customer and distributed generation such rooftop solar at residential general service and or industrial customer site regulated utility is not aware of any proposed legislation in any of it jurisdiction that would give it retail customer the right to choose their electricity provider or otherwise restructure or deregulate the electric industry including broadly subsidizing distributed generation such rooftop solar although there is no pending legislation at this time if the retail jurisdiction served by regulated utility become subject to deregulation the recovery of stranded cost could become significant consideration stranded cost primarily include the generation asset of regulated utility whose value in competitive marketplace may be le than their

cost of the underlying energy wholesaleregulated utility competes with other utility and merchant generator for bulk power sale sale to municipality and cooperative and wholesale transaction the principal factor in competing for these sale are price availability of capacity and power and reliability of service price are influenced primarily by market condition and fuel cost increased competition in the wholesale electric utility industry and the availability of transmission access could affect regulated utility load forecast plan for power supply and wholesale energy sale and related revenue wholesale energy sale will be impacted by the extent to which additional generation is available to sell to the wholesale market and the ability of regulated utility to attract new customer and to retain existing customer energy capacity and resourcesregulated utility owns approximately megawatt mw of generation capacity for additional information on regulated utility generation facility see item property energy and capacity are also supplied through contract with other generator and purchased on the open market factor that could cause regulated utility to purchase power for it customer include generating plant outage extreme weather condition generation reliability demand growth and price regulated utility ha interconnection and arrangement with it neighboring utility to

these facility not have the requisite emission control equipment primarily to meet united state environmental protection agency epa regulation recently approved or proposed duke energy continues to evaluate the potential need to retire these coal fired generating facility earlier than the current estimated useful life and plan to seek regulatory recovery for amount that would not be otherwise recovered when any of these asset are retired for additional information related to potential plant retirement see note to the consolidated financial statement regulatory matter on october the epa published in the federal register the clean power plan cpp rule for regulating carbon dioxide emission from existing fossil fuel fired electric generating unit egus the cpp establishes emission rate and mass cap goal that apply to fossil fuel fired generation under the cpp state are required to develop and submit final compliance plan or an initial plan with an extension request to the epa by september or no later than september with an approved extension these state plan are subject to epa approval with federal plan applied to state that fail to submit plan to the epa or if state plan is not approved legal challenge to the cpp have been filed by stakeholder and motion to stay the requirement of the rule pending the outcome of the litigation have been filed the supreme court granted motion to stay in february effectively blocking enforcement of the rule legal challenge are resolved final resolution of these legal challenge could take several year compliance with cpp could cause the industry to replace coal generation with natural gas and renewables especially in state that have significant reduction target under the rule cost to operate coal fired generation plant continue to grow due to increasing environmental compliance requirement including ash management cost unrelated to cpp and this may result in the retirement of coal fired generation plant earlier than the current useful life duke energy continues to evaluate the need to retire generating facility and plan to seek regulatory recovery where appropriate for amount that have not been recovered upon asset retirement however recovery is subject to future regulatory approval including the recovery of carrying cost on remaining book value and therefore can not be assured isources of electricityregulated

time coal market change coal purchased for the carolina is primarily produced from mine in central appalachia northern appalachia and the illinois basin coal purchased for florida is primarily produced from mine in colorado and the illinois basin coal purchased for indiana is primarily produced in indiana and illinois regulated utility ha an adequate supply of coal under contract to fuel it projected operation and significant portion of supply to fuel it projected operation result of lower natural gas price and le coal fired dispatch within the generation fleet coal inventory may periodically exceed production requirement and result in higher inventory level in these circumstance regulated utility ha worked with supplier to defer contracted delivery renegotiate existing contract volume or ha received regulatory support to adjust generation dispatch to reduce the inventory level the current average sulfur content of coal purchased by regulated utility is percent and percent for duke energy carolina between percent and percent for duke energy progress between percent and percent for duke energy florida and between percent and percent for duke energy indiana regulated utility environmental control in combination with the use of sulfur dioxide emission allowance enable regulated utility to satisfy current emission limitation for it existing facility

cash flow regulatory legislative and legal risksthe duke energy registrant regulated electric revenue earnings and result are dependent on state legislation and regulation that affect electric generation transmission distribution and related activity which may limit their ability to recover cost the duke energy registrant regulated utility business are regulated on cost of service rate of return basis subject to statute and regulatory commission rule and procedure of north carolina south carolina florida ohio indiana and kentucky if the duke energy registrant regulated utility earnings exceed the return established by the state utility commission retail electric rate may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commission which may decrease the duke energy registrant future earnings additionally if regulatory body do not allow recovery of cost incurred in providing service on timely basis the duke energy registrant future earnings could be negatively impacted if legislative and regulatory structure to evolve in such way that the duke energy registrant exclusive right to serve their regulated customer were eroded their future earnings could be negatively impacted in addition federal and state regulation law and other effort designed to promote and expand the use of energy efficiency measure and distributed generation technology such rooftop solar and battery storage in duke energy service territory could result in customer leaving the electric distribution system and an increased customer net energy metering which allows customer with rooftop solar to receive bill credit for surplus power at the full retail amount over time customer adoption of these technology and increased energy efficiency could result in excess generation resource well stranded cost if the company is not able to fully recover the cost and investment in generation deregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition and unrecovered cost that could adversely affect the duke energy registrant financial position result of operation or cash flow and their utility business increased competition resulting from deregulation or restructuring legislation could have significant adverse impact on the duke energy registrant result of operation financial position or cash flow retail competition and the unbundling of regulated electric service could have significant adverse financial impact on the duke energy registrant due to an impairment of asset loss of retail customer lower profit margin or increased cost of capital the duke energy registrant can not predict the extent and timing of entry by additional competitor into the electric market the duke energy registrant can not predict if or when they will be subject

determine the term and rate of transmission and distribution service make acquisition issue equity or debt security engage in transaction with other subsidiary and affiliate and pay dividend upstream to the duke energy registrant change to federal regulation are continuous and ongoing the duke energy registrant can not predict the future course of regulatory change or the ultimate effect those change will have on their business however change in regulation can cause delay in or affect business planning and transaction and can substantially increase the duke energy registrant cost the dan river ash basin release could impact the reputation and financial condition of the duke energy registrant there is uncertainty regarding the extent and timing of future additional cost and liability related to the dan river ash basin release including the amount and extent of any pending or future civil penalty and resulting litigation these uncertainty are likely to continue for an extended

law and regulation generally require the duke energy registrant to obtain and comply with wide variety of environmental license permit inspection and other approval compliance with environmental law and regulation can require significant expenditure including expenditure for cleanup cost and damage arising from contaminated property failure to comply with environmental regulation may result in the imposition of fine penalty and injunctive measure affecting operating asset the step the duke energy registrant could be required to take to ensure their facility are in compliance could be prohibitively expensive result the duke energy registrant may be required to shut down or alter the operation of their facility which may cause the duke energy registrant to incur loss further the duke energy registrant may not be successful in recovering capital and operating cost incurred to comply with new environmental regulation through existing regulatory rate structure and their contract with customer also the duke energy registrant may not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approval for their operating asset or development project delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval failure to obtain and comply with or change in environmental law or regulation to more stringent compliance level could result in additional cost of operation for existing facility or development of new facility being prevented delayed or subject to additional cost although it is not expected that the cost to comply with current environmental regulation will have material adverse effect on the duke energy registrant financial position result of operation or cash flow due to regulatory cost recovery the duke energy registrant are at risk that the cost of complying with environmental regulation in the future will have such an effect ithe epa ha recently enacted or proposed new federal regulation governing the management of

operation may be negatively affected by overall market economic and other condition that are beyond their control sustained downturn or sluggishness in the economy generally affect the market in which the duke energy registrant operate and negatively influence electricity operation decline in demand for electricity result of economic downturn in the duke energy registrant regulated electric service territory will reduce overall sale and lessen cash flow especially industrial customer reduce production and therefore consumption of electricity although the duke energy registrant regulated electric business is subject to regulated allowable rate of return and recovery of certain cost such fuel under periodic adjustment clause overall decline in electricity sold result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenue and cash flow thereby diminishing result of operation additionally prolonged economic downturn that negatively impact the duke energy registrant result of operation and cash flow could result in future material impairment charge to write down the carrying value of certain asset including goodwill to their respective fair value the duke energy registrant also sell electricity into the spot market or other competitive power market on contractual basis with respect to such transaction the duke energy registrant are not guaranteed any rate of return on their capital investment through mandated rate and revenue and result of operation are likely to depend in large part upon prevailing market price these market price may fluctuate substantially over relatively short period of time and could reduce the duke energy registrant revenue and margin thereby diminishing result of operation factor that could impact sale volume generation of electricity and market price at which the duke energy registrant are able to sell electricity are follows weather condition including abnormally mild winter or summer weather that cause lower energy usage for heating or cooling purpose respectively and period of low rainfall that decrease the ability to operate facility in an economical manner supply of and demand for energy commodity transmission or

industry such the san bruno california natural gas transmission pipeline failure could have direct significant impact on the duke energy registrant well on key contractor and supplier such event could indirectly impact the duke energy registrant through change to policy law and regulation whose compliance cost have significant impact on the duke energy registrant financial position result of operation and cash flow the reputation and financial condition of the duke energy registrant could be negatively impacted due to their obligation to comply with federal and state regulation law and other legal requirement that govern the operation assessment storage closure remediation disposal and monitoring relating to coal combustion residual ccr the high cost and new rate impact associated with implementing these new ccr related requirement and the strategy and method necessary to implement these requirement in compliance with these legal obligation result of electricity produced for decade at coal fired power plant the duke energy registrant manage large amount of ccr that are primarily stored in dry storage within landfill or combined with water in other surface impoundment all in compliance with applicable regulatory requirement however the potential exists for another ccr related incident such the one that occurred during the dan river steam station basin release that could raise environmental or general public health concern such ccr related incident could have material adverse impact on the reputation and financial condition of the duke energy registrant iduring epa regulation were enacted related to the management of ccr from power plant these regulation classify ccr nonhazardous waste under the rcra and apply to electric generating site with new and existing landfill new and existing surface impoundment structural fill and ccr pile and establishes requirement regarding landfill design structural integrity design and assessment criterion for surface impoundment groundwater monitoring and protection procedure and other operational and reporting procedure for the disposal and management of ccr in addition to the federal regulation ccr landfill and surface impoundment will continue to be independently regulated by existing state law regulation and permit well additional legal requirement that may be imposed in the future these federal and state law regulation and other legal requirement may require or result in additional expenditure increased operating and maintenance cost and or result in closure of certain power generating facility which could affect the financial position result of operation and cash flow of the duke energy registrant the duke energy registrant intend to seek full cost recovery for expenditure through the normal ratemaking process with state and federal utility commission who permit recovery in rate of necessary and prudently incurred cost associated with the duke energy registrant regulated operation and through other wholesale contract with term that contemplate recovery of such cost although there is no guarantee of full cost recovery in addition the timing for recovery of such cost could have material adverse impact on duke energy cash flow the duke energy registrant have recognized significant asset retirement obligation related to these ccr related requirement in closure activity began at the four site specified high priority by the north carolina coal ash management act coal ash act and at the lee steam station site in south carolina in connection with other legal requirement excavation at these site involves movement of large amount of ccr material to offsite location for use structural fill and to offsite or onsite lined landfill at other site preliminary planning and closure method have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management cost coal ash act requires ccr surface impoundment in north carolina to be closed with the closure method based on risk ranking classification determined by state regulator and the north carolina coal ash commission other than the high priority site specifically delineated by coal ash act the north carolina department of environmental quality ncdeq ha issued either preliminary draft risk ranking or ha yet to designate specific risk classification these proposed risk ranking remain subject to public comment period including public meeting followed by final risk ranking recommendation by the ncdeq to the coal ash commission for the coal ash commission final approval the closure and ccr management work progress final risk ranking classification of surface impoundment in north carolina are delineated and final closure plan are developed and approved at each site the scope and complexity of work and the amount of ccr material could be greater than estimate and could therefore materially increase compliance expenditure and rate impact the duke energy registrant financial position result of operation and cash flow may be negatively affected by lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customer or decline in customer demand or number of customer growth in customer account and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and delivery facility customer growth and customer usage are affected by number of factor outside the control of the duke energy registrant such mandated energy efficiency measure demand side management goal distributed generation resource and economic and demographic condition such population change job and income growth housing start new business formation and the overall level of economic activity certain regulatory and legislative body have introduced or are considering requirement and or incentive to reduce energy consumption by certain date additionally technological advance driven by federal law mandating new level of energy efficiency in end use electric device or other improvement in or application of technology could lead to decline in per caput energy consumption advance in distributed generation technology that produce power including fuel cell micro turbine wind turbine and solar cell may reduce the cost of alternative method of producing power to level competitive with central power station electric production utilized by the duke energy registrant some or all of these factor could result in lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customer and may cause the failure of the duke energy registrant to fully realize anticipated benefit from significant capital investment and expenditure which could have material adverse effect on their financial position result of operation and cash flow furthermore the duke energy registrant currently have energy efficiency rider in place to recover the cost of energy efficiency program in north carolina south carolina florida ohio and kentucky should the duke energy registrant be required to invest in conservation measure that result in reduced sale from effective conservation regulatory lag in adjusting rate for the impact of these measure could have negative financial impact the duke energy registrant operating result may fluctuate on seasonal and quarterly basis and can be negatively affected by change in weather condition and severe weather electric power generation is generally seasonal business in most part of the and other market in which duke energy operates demand for power peak during the warmer summer month with market price typically peaking at that time in other area demand for power peak during the winter further extreme weather condition such heat wave or winter storm could cause these seasonal fluctuation to be more pronounced result in the future the overall operating result of the duke energy registrant business may fluctuate substantially on seasonal and quarterly basis and thus make period to period comparison le relevant sustained severe drought condition could impact generation by hydroelectric plant well fossil and nuclear plant operation these facility use water for cooling purpose and for the operation of environmental compliance equipment furthermore destruction caused by severe weather event such hurricane tornado severe thunderstorm snow and ice storm can result in lost operating revenue due to outage property damage including downed transmission and distribution line and additional and unexpected expense to mitigate storm damage the cost of storm restoration effort may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process ithe duke energy registrant sale may decrease if they are unable to gain adequate reliable and affordable access to transmission asset the duke energy registrant depend on transmission and distribution facility owned and operated by utility and other energy company to deliver electricity sold to the wholesale market ferc power transmission regulation well those of duke energy international market require wholesale electric transmission service to be offered on an open access non discriminatory basis if transmission is disrupted or if transmission capacity is inadequate the duke energy registrant ability to sell and deliver product may be hindered the different regional power market have changing regulatory structure which could affect growth and performance in these region in addition the isos who oversee the transmission system in regional power market have imposed in the past and may impose in the future price limitation and other mechanism to address volatility in the power market these type of price limitation and other mechanism may adversely impact the profitability of the duke energy registrant wholesale power marketing business fluctuation in commodity price or availability may adversely affect various aspect of the duke energy registrant operation well their financial condition result of operation and cash flow the duke energy registrant are exposed to the effect of market fluctuation in the price of natural gas coal fuel oil nuclear fuel electricity and other energy related commodity result of their ownership of energy related asset fuel cost are recovered primarily through cost recovery clause subject to the approval of state utility commission additionally the duke energy registrant are exposed to risk that counterparties will not be able to fulfill their obligation disruption in the delivery of fuel including disruption result of among other thing transportation delay weather labor relation force majeure event or environmental regulation affecting any of these fuel supplier could limit the duke energy registrant to operate their facility should counterparties fail to perform the duke energy registrant might be forced to replace the underlying commitment at prevailing market price possibly resulting in loss in addition to the amount if any already paid to the counterparties certain of the duke energy registrant hedge agreement may result in the receipt of or posting of derivative collateral with counterparties depending on the daily derivative position fluctuation in commodity price that lead to the return of collateral received and or the posting of collateral with counterparties negatively impact liquidity downgrade in the duke energy registrant credit rating could lead to additional collateral posting requirement the duke energy registrant continually monitor derivative position in relation to market price activity potential terrorist activity or military or other action could adversely affect the duke energy registrant business the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the and it ally may lead to increased political economic and financial market instability and volatility in price for natural gas and oil which may have material adverse effect in way the duke energy registrant can not predict at this time in addition future act of terrorism and possible reprisal consequence of action by the and it ally could be directed against company operating in the or their international affiliate information technology system transmission and distribution and generation facility such nuclear plant could be potential target of terrorist activity or harmful activity by individual or group the potential for terrorism ha subjected the duke energy registrant operation to increased risk and could have material adverse effect on their business in particular the duke energy registrant may experience increased capital and operating cost to implement increased security for their information technology system transmission and distribution and generation facility including nuclear power plant under the nrc design basis threat requirement these increased cost could include additional physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following terrorist incident cyberattacks and data security breach could adversely affect the duke energy registrant business information security risk have generally increased in recent year result of the proliferation of new technology and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks and data security breach the utility industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology system and network infrastructure which are part of an interconnected regional grid additionally connectivity to the internet continues to increase through smart grid and other initiative of the critical nature of the infrastructure increased connectivity to the internet and technology system inherent vulnerability to disability or failure due to hacking virus act of war or terrorism or other type of data security breach the duke energy registrant face heightened risk of cyberattack in the event of such an attack the duke energy registrant could have business operation disrupted property damaged customer information stolen and other private information accessed ii experience substantial loss of revenue repair and restoration cost implementation cost for additional security measure to avert future cyberattacks and other financial loss and iii be subject to increased regulation litigation and reputational damage failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could unfavorably impact the duke energy registrant result of operation certain event such an aging workforce mismatch of skill set or complement to future need or unavailability of contract resource may lead to operating challenge and increased cost the challenge include lack of resource loss of knowledge base and the lengthy time required for skill development in this case cost including cost for contractor to replace employee productivity cost and safety cost may rise failure to hire and adequately train replacement employee including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employee or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business especially considering the workforce need associated with nuclear generation facility and new skill required to operate modernized technology enabled power grid if the duke energy registrant are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce their financial position or result of operation could be negatively affected iduke energy investment and project located outside of the expose it to risk related to fluctuation in currency rate these risk and duke energy activity to mitigate such risk may adversely affect it cash flow and result of operation duke energy operation and investment outside the expose it to risk related to fluctuation in currency rate each local currency value change relative to the dollar the value in dollar of duke energy asset and liability in such locality and the cash flow generated in such locality expressed in dollar also change duke energy primary foreign currency rate exposure is to the brazilian real duke energy selectively mitigates some risk associated with foreign currency fluctuation by among other thing indexing contract to the dollar and or local inflation rate hedging through debt denominated or issued in the foreign currency and hedging through foreign currency derivative these effort however may not be effective and in some case may expose duke energy to other risk that could negatively affect it cash flow and result of operation the cost of retiring duke energy florida crystal river unit could prove to be more extensive than is currently identified cost to retire and decommission the plant could exceed estimate and if not recoverable through the regulatory process could adversely affect duke energy progress energy and duke energy florida financial condition result of operation and cash flow duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana membership in an rto present risk that could have material adverse effect on their result of operation financial condition and cash flow the rule governing the various regional power market may change which could affect duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana cost and or revenue to the degree duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana incur significant additional fee and increased cost to participate in an rto their result of operation may be impacted duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana may be allocated portion of the cost of transmission facility built by others due to change in rto transmission rate design duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana may be required to expand their transmission system according to decision made by an rto rather than their own internal planning process while rto transmission rate were initially designed to be revenue neutral various proposal and proceeding currently taking place by the ferc may cause transmission rate to change from time to time in addition rtos have been developing rule associated with the allocation and methodology of assigning cost associated with improved transmission reliability reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission right that may have financial impact on duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana member of an rto duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana are subject to certain additional risk including those associated with the allocation among rto member of loss caused by unreimbursed default of other participant in the rto market and those associated with complaint case filed against an rto that may seek refund of revenue previously earned by rto member nuclear generation risksduke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida may incur substantial cost and liability due to their ownership and operation of nuclear generating facility ownership interest in and operation of nuclear station by duke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida subject them to various risk these risk include among other thing the potential harmful effect on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facility and the storage handling and disposal of radioactive material limitation on the amount and type of insurance commercially available to cover loss that might arise in connection with nuclear operation and uncertainty with respect to the technological and financial aspect of decommissioning nuclear plant at the end of their licensed life ownership and operation of nuclear generation facility requires compliance with licensing and safety related requirement imposed by the nrc in the event of non compliance the nrc may increase regulatory oversight impose fine and or shut down unit depending upon it assessment of the severity of the situation revised security and safety requirement promulgated by the nrc which could be prompted by among other thing event within or outside of the control of duke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida such serious nuclear incident at facility owned by third party could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditure well assessment to cover third party loss in addition if serious nuclear incident were to occur it could have material adverse effect on the result of operation and financial condition and reputation of the duke energy registrant liquidity capital requirement and common stock risksthe duke energy registrant rely on access to short term borrowing and longer term capital market to finance their capital requirement and support their liquidity need access to those market can be adversely affected by number of condition many of which are beyond the duke energy registrant control the duke energy registrant business are to large degree financed through issuance of debt the maturity and repayment profile of debt used to finance investment often doe not correlate to cash flow from their asset accordingly source of liquidity for capital requirement not satisfied by the cash flow from their operation and to fund investment originally financed through debt instrument with disparate maturity the duke energy registrant rely on access to short term money market well longer term capital market the subsidiary registrant also rely on access to short term intercompany borrowing if the duke energy registrant are not able to access capital at competitive rate or at all the ability to finance their operation and implement their strategy and business plan scheduled could be adversely affected an inability to access capital may limit the duke energy registrant ability to pursue improvement or acquisition that they may otherwise rely on for future growth imarket disruption may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial market such disruption could include economic downturn the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company capital market condition generally market price for electricity and gas actual or threatened terrorist attack or the overall health of the energy industry the availability of credit under duke energy master credit facility depends upon the ability of the bank providing commitment under the facility to provide fund when their obligation to do so arise systematic risk of the banking system and the financial market could prevent bank from meeting it obligation under the facility agreement duke energy maintains revolving credit facility to provide backup for it commercial paper program and letter of credit to support variable rate demand tax exempt bond that may be put to the duke energy registrant issuer at the option of the holder the facility includes borrowing sublimits for the duke energy registrant each of is party to the credit facility and financial covenant that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding percentage of the total capital for the specific entity failure to maintain these covenant at particular entity could preclude duke energy from issuing commercial paper or the duke energy registrant from issuing letter of credit or borrowing under the master credit facility the duke energy registrant must meet credit quality standard and there is no assurance they will maintain investment grade credit rating if the duke energy registrant are unable to maintain investment grade credit rating they would be required under credit agreement to provide collateral in the form of letter of credit or cash which may materially adversely affect their liquidity each of the duke energy registrant senior long term debt issuance is currently rated investment grade by various rating agency the duke energy registrant can not ensure their senior long term debt will be rated investment grade in the future if the rating agency were to rate the duke energy registrant below investment grade borrowing cost would increase perhaps significantly in addition the potential pool of investor and funding source would likely decrease further if the short term debt rating were to fall access to the commercial paper market could be significantly limited downgrade below investment grade could also require the posting of additional collateral in the form of letter of credit or cash under various credit commodity and capacity agreement and trigger termination clause in some interest rate derivative agreement which would require cash payment all of these event would likely reduce the duke energy registrant liquidity and profitability and could have material effect on their financial position result of operation or cash flow non compliance with debt covenant or condition could adversely affect the duke energy registrant ability to execute future borrowing the duke energy registrant debt and credit agreement contain various financial and other covenant failure to meet those covenant beyond applicable grace period could result in accelerated due date and or termination of the agreement market performance and other change may decrease the value of the ndtf investment of duke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida which could require significant additional funding ownership and operation of nuclear generation facility also requires the maintenance of funded trust that are intended to pay for the decommissioning cost of the respective nuclear power plant the performance of the capital market affect the value of the asset held in trust to satisfy these future obligation duke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida have significant obligation in this area and hold significant asset in these trust these asset are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain return which may fall below projected rate of return although number of factor impact funding requirement decline in the market value of the asset may increase the funding requirement of the obligation for decommissioning nuclear plant if duke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida are unable to successfully manage their ndtf asset their financial condition result of operation and cash flow could be negatively affected poor investment performance of the duke energy pension plan holding and other factor impacting pension plan cost could unfavorably impact the duke energy registrant liquidity and result of operation the cost of providing non contributory defined benefit pension plan are dependent upon number of factor such the rate of return on plan asset discount rate the level of interest rate used to measure the required minimum funding level of the plan future government regulation and required or voluntary contribution made to the plan the subsidiary registrant are allocated their proportionate share of the cost and obligation related to these plan without sustained growth in the pension investment over time to increase the value of plan asset and depending upon the other factor impacting cost listed above duke energy could be required to fund it plan with significant amount of cash such cash funding obligation and the

request to the epa by september or no later than september with an approved extension these state plan are subject to epa approval with federal plan applied to state that fail to submit plan to the epa or if state plan is not approved legal challenge to the cpp have been filed by stakeholder and motion to stay the requirement of the rule pending the outcome of the litigation have been filed the supreme court granted motion to stay in february effectively blocking enforcement of the rule until legal challenge are resolved final resolution of these legal challenge could take several year compliance with cpp could cause the industry to replace coal generation with natural gas and renewables especially in state that have significant reduction target under the rule cost to operate coal fired generation plant continue to grow due to increasing environmental compliance requirement including ash management cost unrelated to cpp and this may result in the retirement of coal fired generation plant earlier than the current useful life regulated utility continues to evaluate the need to retire generating facility and plan to seek regulatory recovery where appropriate for amount that have not been recovered upon asset retirement however recovery is subject to future regulatory approval including the recovery of carrying cost on remaining book value and therefore can not be assured in addition regulated utility could incur increased fuel purchased power operation and maintenance and other cost for replacement generation result of this rule regulated utility can not

cash flow and the market approach which estimate fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industry significant assumption used in these fair value analysis include discount and growth rate future rate of return expected to result from ongoing rate regulation utility sector market performance and transaction projected operating and capital cash flow for duke energy business and the fair value of debt estimated future cash flow under the income approach are based to large extent on duke energy internal business plan and adjusted appropriate for duke energy view of market participant assumption duke energy internal business plan reflects management assumption related to customer usage and attrition based on internal data and economic data obtained from third party source projected commodity pricing data and potential change in environmental regulation the business plan assumes the occurrence of certain event in the future such the outcome of future rate filing future approved rate of return on equity anticipated earnings return related to significant future capital investment continued recovery of cost of service the renewal of certain contract and the future of renewable tax credit management also make assumption regarding operation maintenance and general and administrative cost based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned event in estimating cash flow duke energy incorporates expected growth rate regulatory and economic stability the ability to renew contract and other factor into it revenue and expense forecast one of the most significant assumption that duke energy utilizes in determining the fair value of it reporting unit under the income approach is the discount rate applied to the estimated future cash flow management determines the appropriate discount rate for each of it reporting unit based on the weighted average cost of capital wacc for each individual reporting unit the wacc take into account both the after tax cost of debt and cost of equity major component of the cost of equity is the current risk free rate on year treasury bond in the impairment test duke energy considered implied waccs for certain peer company in determining the appropriate wacc rate to use in it analysis each reporting unit ha different risk profile based on the nature of it operation including factor such regulation the wacc for each reporting unit may differ accordingly the waccs were adjusted appropriate to account for company specific risk premium the discount rate used for calculating the fair value of august for each of duke energy domestic reporting unit ranged from percent to percent for duke energy international operation country specific risk adder based on the average risk premium for each separate country in which international energy operates wa added to the base discount rate to reflect the differing risk profile this resulted in discount rate for the august goodwill impairment test for the international operation of percent the underlying assumption and estimate are made of point in time subsequent change particularly change in the discount rate authorized regulated rate of return or growth rate inherent in management estimate of future cash flow could result in future impairment charge the majority of duke energy business is in environment that are either fully or partially rate regulated in such environment revenue requirement are adjusted periodically by regulator based on factor including level of cost sale volume and cost of capital accordingly duke energy regulated utility operate to some degree with buffer from the direct effect positive or negative of significant swing in market or economic condition however significant change in discount rate over prolonged period may have material impact on the fair value of equity of august all of the reporting unit estimated fair value of equity substantially exceeded the carrying value of equity for further information see note to the consolidated financial statement goodwill and intangible asset long lived asset impairment assessment excluding regulated operationsproperty plant and equipment excluding plant held for sale is stated at the lower of carrying value historical cost le accumulated depreciation and previously recorded impairment or fair value if impaired duke energy evaluates property plant and equipment for impairment when event or change in circumstance such significant change in cash flow projection the determination that it is more likely than not an asset or asset group will be sold indicate the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable the determination of whether an impairment ha occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flow attributable to the asset compared with their carrying value iiperforming an impairment evaluation involves significant degree of estimation and judgment in area such identifying circumstance that indicate an impairment may exist identifying and grouping affected asset and developing the undiscounted future cash flow if an impairment ha occurred the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value and recording loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value additionally determining fair value requires probability weighting future cash flow to reflect expectation about possible variation in their amount or timing and the selection of an appropriate discount rate although cash flow estimate are based on relevant information available at the time the estimate are made estimate of future cash flow are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual result for asset identified held for sale the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value le cost to sell to determine if an impairment loss is required until the asset are disposed of their estimated fair value is re evaluated when circumstance or event change when determining whether an asset or asset group ha been impaired management group asset at the lowest level that ha discrete cash flow for further information see note to the consolidated financial statement acquisition and disposition accounting for loss contingenciespreparation of financial statement and related disclosure require judgment regarding the future outcome of contingent event duke energy is involved in certain legal and environmental matter arising in the normal course of business estimating probable loss requires analysis of multiple forecast and scenario that often depend on judgment about potential action by third party such federal state and local court and regulator contingent liability are often resolved over long period of time amount recorded in the consolidated financial statement may differ from the actual outcome once the contingency is resolved which could have material impact on future result of operation financial position and cash flow of duke energy for further information see note and to the consolidated financial statement regulatory matter and commitment and contingency revenue recognition revenue on sale of electricity and gas are recognized when either the service is provided or the product is delivered operating revenue include unbilled electric and gas revenue earned when service ha been delivered but not billed by the end of the accounting period unbilled retail revenue are estimated by applying an average revenue per kilowatt hour kwh or per thousand cubic foot mcf for all customer class to the number of estimated kwh or mcf delivered but not billed unbilled wholesale energy revenue are calculated by applying the contractual rate per mwh to the number of estimated mwh delivered but not yet billed unbilled wholesale demand revenue are calculated by applying the contractual rate per mw to the mw volume delivered but not yet billed the amount of unbilled revenue can vary significantly from period to period result of numerous factor including seasonality weather customer usage pattern customer mix timing of rendering customer bill and the average price in effect for customer class pension and other post retirement benefitsthe calculation of pension expense other post retirement benefit expense and net pension and other post retirement asset or liability require the use of assumption and election of permissible accounting alternative change in assumption can result in different expense and reported asset or liability amount and future actual experience can differ from the assumption duke energy belief the most critical assumption for pension and other post retirement benefit are the expected long term rate of return on plan asset and the assumed discount rate applied to future benefit payment additionally the health care cost trend rate assumption is critical to duke energy estimate of other post retirement benefit duke energy elect to amortize net actuarial gain or loss in excess of the corridor of percent of the greater of the market related value of plan asset or plan projected benefit obligation into net pension or other post retirement benefit expense over the average remaining service period of active covered employee prior service cost or credit which represents the effect on plan liability due to plan amendment is amortized over the average remaining service period of active covered employee duke energy maintains non contributory defined benefit retirement plan the plan cover most employee using cash balance formula under cash balance formula plan participant accumulates retirement benefit consisting of pay credit based upon percentage of current eligible earnings based on age and year of service and current interest credit certain employee are covered under plan that use final average earnings formula of january the qualified and non qualified non contributory defined benefit plan are closed to new and rehired non union and certain unionized employee duke energy provides some health care and life insurance benefit for retired employee on contributory and non contributory basis certain employee are eligible for these benefit if they have met age and service requirement at retirement defined in the plan of december duke energy assumes pension and other post retirement plan asset will generate long term rate of return of percent the expected long term rate of return wa developed using weighted average calculation of expected return based primarily on future expected return across asset class considering the use of active asset manager where applicable equity security are held for their higher expected return debt security are primarily held to hedge the pension liability hedge fund real estate and other global security are held for diversification investment within asset class are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual manager on investment in duke energy adopted de risking investment strategy for it pension asset the funded status of the plan increase over time the targeted allocation to return seeking asset will be reduced and the targeted allocation to fixed income asset will be increased to better manage duke energy pension liability and reduced funded status volatility effective january based on the current funded status of the plan the asset allocation for the duke energy pension plan ha been adjusted to percent fixed income asset and percent return seeking asset duke energy regularly review it actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances it investment to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate iithe asset for duke energy pension and other post retirement plan are maintained in master trust duke energy also invests other post retirement asset in the duke energy corporation employee benefit trust veba the investment objective of veba is to achieve sufficient return subject to prudent level of portfolio risk for the purpose of promoting the security of plan benefit for participant veba is passively managed duke energy discounted it future pension and other post retirement obligation using rate of percent of december discount rate used to measure benefit plan obligation for financial reporting purpose reflect rate at which pension benefit could be effectively settled of december duke energy determined it discount rate for pension and other post retirement obligation using bond selection settlement portfolio approach this approach develops discount rate by selecting portfolio of high quality corporate bond that generate sufficient cash flow to match the timing of projected benefit payment the selected bond portfolio is derived from universe of non callable corporate bond rated aa quality or higher after the bond portfolio is selected single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan projected benefit payment discounted at this rate with the market value of the bond selected future change in plan asset return assumed discount rate and various other factor related to the participant in duke energy pension and post retirement plan will impact future pension expense and liability duke energy can not predict with certainty what these factor will be in the future the following table present the approximate effect on duke energy pretax pension expense pretax other post

entered into by regulated business are reflected regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet undesignated contract entered into by unregulated business are marked to market each period with change in the fair value of the derivative instrument reflected in earnings duke energy may also enter into other contract that qualify for the normal purchase normal sale npns exception when contract meet the criterion to qualify an npns duke energy applies such exception income recognition and realization related to npns contract generally coincide with the physical delivery of the commodity for contract qualifying for the npns exception no recognition of the contract fair value in the consolidated financial statement is required until settlement of the contract long the transaction remains probable of occurring generation portfolio risk duke energy is primarily exposed to market price fluctuation of wholesale power natural gas and coal price in the regulated utility segment the duke energy registrant optimize the value of their generation portfolio which include generation asset fuel and emission allowance modeled forecast of future generation output and fuel requirement are based on forward power and fuel market the component piece of the portfolio are bought and sold based on model and forecast of generation in order to manage the economic value of the portfolio in accordance with the strategy of the business unit for the regulated utility segment the generation portfolio not utilized to serve retail operation or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuation however the impact on the consolidated statement of operation is partially offset by mechanism in these regulated jurisdiction that result in the sharing of net profit from these activity with retail customer international energy generally hedge their expected generation using long term bilateral power sale contract when favorable market condition exist and are subject to wholesale commodity price risk for electricity not sold under such contract international energy dispatch electricity not sold under long term bilateral contract into unregulated market and receives wholesale energy margin and capacity revenue from national system operator iiinterest rate riskduke energy is exposed to risk resulting from change in interest rate result of it issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper duke energy manages interest rate exposure by limiting variable rate exposure to percentage of total debt and by monitoring the effect of market change in interest rate duke energy also enters into financial derivative instrument which may include instrument such but not limited to interest rate swap swaptions and treasury lock agreement to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure see note and to the consolidated financial statement summary of significant accounting policy debt and credit facility derivative and hedging and fair value measurement at december duke energy had million notional amount of floating to fixed swap outstanding million notional amount of fixed to floating swap outstanding and million forward starting swap outstanding in the first quarter of duke energy entered into an additional million notional amount of forward starting swap duke energy had billion of unhedged long and short term floating interest rate exposure at december the impact of basis point change in interest rate on pretax income is approximately million at december this amount wa estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on variable rate security outstanding adjusted for interest rate hedge of december see note and acquisition and disposition and derivative and hedging respectively to the consolidated financial statement for additional information about the forward starting interest rate swap related to the piedmont acquisition credit riskcredit risk represents the loss that the duke energy registrant would incur if counterparty fails to perform under it contractual obligation where exposed to credit risk the duke energy registrant analyze the counterparty financial condition prior to entering into an agreement and monitor exposure on an on going basis the duke energy registrant establish credit limit where appropriate in the context of contractual arrangement and monitor such limit to reduce credit exposure the duke energy registrant seek to include netting provision with counterparties which permit the offset of receivables and payable with such counterparties the duke energy registrant also frequently use master agreement with credit support annex to further mitigate certain credit exposure the master agreement provide for counterparty to post cash or letter of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold the threshold amount represents negotiated unsecured credit limit for each party to the agreement determined in accordance with the duke energy registrant internal corporate credit practice and standard collateral agreement generally also provide that the inability to post collateral is sufficient cause to terminate contract and liquidate all position the duke energy registrant also obtain cash or letter of credit from certain counterparties to provide credit support outside of collateral agreement where appropriate based on financial analysis of the counterparty and the regulatory or contractual term and condition applicable to each transaction see note to the consolidated financial statement derivative and hedging for additional information regarding credit risk related to derivative instrument the duke energy registrant principal counterparties for it electric and gas business are regional transmission organization distribution company municipality electric cooperative and utility located throughout the and latin america the duke energy registrant have concentration of receivables from such entity throughout these region these concentration of receivables may affect the duke energy registrant overall credit risk in that risk factor can negatively impact the credit quality of the entire sector the duke energy registrant are also subject to credit risk from transaction with their supplier that involve pre payment in conjunction with outsourcing arrangement major construction project and certain commodity purchase the duke energy registrant credit exposure to such supplier may take the form of increased cost or project delay in the event of non performance the duke energy registrant frequently require guarantee or letter of credit from supplier to mitigate this credit risk credit risk associated with the duke energy registrant service to residential commercial and industrial customer is generally limited to outstanding account receivable the duke energy registrant mitigate this credit risk by requiring customer to provide cash deposit letter of credit or surety bond until satisfactory payment history is established subject to the rule and regulation in effect in each retail jurisdiction at which time the deposit is typically refunded charge offs for retail customer have historically been insignificant to the operation of the duke energy registrant and are typically recovered through retail rate management continually monitor customer charge offs and payment pattern to ensure the adequacy of bad debt reserve duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana sell certain of their account receivable and related collection through cinergy

federal state and local regulation regarding air and water quality hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matter the subsidiary registrant are subject to federal state and local regulation regarding air and water quality hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matter these regulation can be changed from time to time and result in new obligation of the duke energy registrant the following section outline various proposed and recently enacted regulation that may impact the duke energy registrant refer to note to the consolidated financial statement regulatory matter for further information regarding potential plant retirement and regulatory filing related to the duke energy registrant coal combustion residualson april the epa published in the federal register rule to regulate the disposal of ccr from electric utility solid waste the federal regulation which became effective in october classifies ccr nonhazardous waste under subtitle of the resource conservation and recovery act and allows for beneficial use of ccr with some restriction the regulation applies to all new and existing landfill new and existing surface impoundment receiving ccr and existing surface impoundment that are no longer receiving ccr but contain liquid located at station currently generating electricity regardless of fuel source the rule establishes requirement regarding landfill design structural integrity design and assessment criterion for surface impoundment groundwater monitoring and protection procedure and other operational and reporting procedure to ensure the safe disposal and management of ccr in addition to the requirement of the federal ccr regulation ccr landfill and surface impoundment will continue to be independently regulated by most state duke energy carolina progress energy duke energy progress duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana recorded asset retirement obligation amount during cost recovery for future expenditure will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commission and via wholesale contract which permit recovery of necessary and prudently incurred cost associated with duke energy regulated operation for more information see note to the consolidated financial statement asset retirement obligation duke energy ohio nonregulated beckjord station facility retired during is not subject to the recently enacted epa rule related to the disposal of ccr from electric utility however if cost are incurred result of environmental regulation or to mitigate risk associated with on site storage of coal ash at the facility the cost could have an adverse impact on duke energy ohio financial position result of operation and cash flow cost incurred by ovec related to environmental regulation could also have an adverse impact on duke energy ohio financial position result of operation and cash flow north carolina coal ash management act of september the coal ash act became law and wa amended on june by the north carolina mountain energy act the coal ash act amended established regulation regarding the use and closure of existing ash impoundment the disposal of ash at active coal plant and the handling of surface and groundwater impact from ash basin in north carolina the coal ash act amended deemed eight ash impoundment at four facility to be high priority and requires closure no later than august with potential extension for closure of the asheville impoundment until the coal ash act requires state regulator to provide risk ranking classification for the remaining ash impoundment at north carolina facility the method and timing of closure of these ash impoundment will be determined by the specific risk classification with closure no later than december other than the high priority site specifically delineated by the coal ash act the ncdeq ha issued either preliminary draft risk ranking or ha yet to designate specific risk classification these risk ranking were generally determined based on three primary criterion structural integrity of impoundment and impact to both surface and groundwaters ncdeq categorized basin at four site intermediate risk and four basin at three plant low risk ncdeq also categorized nine basin at six plant low to intermediate risk thereby not assigning proposed risk ranking at this time the risk ranking of these site will be based upon receipt of additional data primarily related to groundwater quality and the completion of specific modification and repair to the impoundment ncdeq is expected to finalize it risk classification after public comment process final proposed classification are subject to coal ash commission adjustment and approval but may become law if the commission fails to act within day of receiving the final proposed classification estimated asset retirement obligation have been recognized based on the assigned risk category or if not assigned based on probability weighting of

april several petition for review of the final rule were denied by the court of appeal for the district of columbia circuit court on november the supreme court granted petition for review based on the issue of whether the epa unreasonably refused to consider cost in determining whether it is appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutant from coal fired and oil fired steam electric generating unit in june the supreme court reversed the circuit court decision and remanded the case to the circuit court for further proceeding finding that the epa erred in refusing to consider cost when deciding whether it wa appropriate and necessary to regulate emission of hazardous air pollutant from steam electric generating unit in december the circuit court granted the epa request to keep the rule in effect while the agency completes the rulemaking in response to the supreme court ruling on december the epa proposed supplemental finding to address the cost issue raised by the supreme court in it june ruling if finalized proposed the finding would result in no change to the current mat regulatory requirement the epa ha committed to complete it rulemaking by april the duke energy registrant can not predict the result of these proceeding clean water act the epa published the final cooling water intake structure rule on august with an effective date of october the rule applies to of the electric generating facility the duke energy registrant own and operate the rule allows for several option to demonstrate compliance and provides flexibility to the state environmental

duke energy registrant also expect to incur increased fuel purchased power operation and maintenance and other expense in addition to cost for replacement generation for potential coal fired power plant retirement result of these regulation actual compliance cost incurred may be materially different from these estimate due to reason such the timing and requirement of epa regulation and the resolution of legal challenge to the rule the duke energy registrant intend to seek rate recovery of necessary and prudently incurred cost associated with regulated operation to comply with these regulation cross state air pollution ruleon august the final cross state air pollution rule csapr wa published in the federal register the csapr established state level annual sulfur dioxide budget and annual and seasonal nitrogen oxide nox budget that were to take effect on january iion august the circuit court vacated the csapr the court also directed the epa to continue administering the clean air interstate rule cair which required additional reduction in and nox emission beginning in on april the supreme court supreme court reversed the circuit court decision finding that with csapr the epa reasonably interpreted the good neighbor provision of the caa the case wa remanded to the circuit court for further proceeding consistent with the supreme court opinion on october the circuit court lifted the csapr stay which allowed phase of the rule to take effect on january terminating the cair where the csapr requirement are constraining action to meet the requirement could include purchasing emission allowance power purchase curtailing generation and utilizing low sulfur fuel the csapr will not result in duke energy registrant adding new emission control additional legal challenge to the csapr filed in not addressed by the circuit court decision to vacate the csapr are still ongoing oral argument were held february on july the court issued decision finding certain phase and emission budget invalid which impact south carolina north carolina and florida the court remanded the csapr to the epa for reconsideration of the budget in question on december the epa proposed rule to lower the current csapr phase state ozone season nox emission budget for eastern state including north carolina ohio kentucky and indiana the epa also proposed to eliminate the csapr phase ozone season state nox budget for florida and south carolina the epa proposed that these change to state budget take effect on may the duke energy registrant can not predict the outcome of these proceeding carbon pollution standard for new modified and reconstructed power plantson october the epa published final rule in the federal register establishing carbon dioxide emission limit for new modified and reconstructed power plant the requirement for new plant do not apply to any facility that duke energy currently ha in operation but would apply to any plant that will be constructed going forward the epa set an emission standard for coal unit of lb of per gross mwh while this limit is higher than the epa proposed standard of lb per mwh it would still require the application of partial carbon capture and storage cc technology for coal unit to be able to meet the limit utility scale cc is not currently demonstrated and commercially available technology for coal fired electric generating unit and therefore the final standard effectively bar the development of new coal fired generation the final standard of lb of per gross mwh for new natural gas combined cycle unit is the same the proposed limit the duke energy registrant do not expect the impact of the final standard will be material to duke energy financial position result of operation or cash flow clean power planon october the epa published in the federal register the cpp rule that regulates emission from existing fossil fuel fired egus the cpp establishes emission rate and mass cap goal that apply to fossil fuel fired generation under the cpp state are required to develop and submit final compliance plan or an initial plan with an extension request to the epa by september state that receive an extension must submit final completed plan to the epa by september the epa intends to review and approve or disapprove state plan within month of receipt the cpp doe not directly impose regulatory requirement on the duke energy registrant state implementation plan will include the regulatory requirement that will apply to the duke energy registrant the epa also published proposed federal plan for public comment federal plan would be applied to state that fail to submit plan to epa or where state plan is not approved by the epa comment on the proposed federal plan were due by january legal challenge to the final cpp have been filed by stakeholder on january the court of appeal for the district of columbia denied motion from petitioner to stay the clean power plan pending court review the court did grant petitioner request for expedited briefing in the case oral argument are scheduled in june the court ordered that final brief in the case be filed by april on february the supreme court granted stay in the matter halting enforcement until legal challenge are resolved compliance with cpp could cause the industry to replace coal generation with natural gas and renewables cost to operate coal fired generation plant continue to grow due to increasing environmental compliance requirement including ash management cost unrelated to cpp which may result in the retirement of coal fired generation plant earlier than the current useful life the duke energy registrant are studying the cpp rule and are working with state to identify the best approach for developing state plan that will establish the regulatory requirement applicable to the duke energy registrant the duke energy registrant could incur increased fuel purchased power operation and maintenance and other cost for replacement generation result of this rule due to the uncertainty related to the implementation of the cpp the duke energy registrant can not predict the outcome of these matter global climate changethe duke energy registrant greenhouse gas ghg emission consist primarily of with most coming from their fleet of coal fired power plant in the in the duke energy registrant power plant in the emitted approximately million ton of duke energy international operation emitted approximately million ton of in the duke energy registrant future emission will be influenced by variable including new regulation economic condition that affect electricity demand and the duke energy registrant decision regarding generation technology deployed to meet customer electricity need the duke energy registrant have taken action that ha resulted in reduced emission over time between and the duke energy registrant have collectively lowered the emission from their electricity generation in the by more than percent these action will lower the exposure to any future mandatory emission reduction requirement or carbon tax whether result of federal legislation or the final cpp regulation under any future scenario involving mandatory limitation the duke energy registrant would plan to seek recovery of their compliance cost through appropriate regulatory mechanism iithe duke energy registrant recognize certain group associate severe weather event with climate change and forecast the possibility these weather event could have material impact on future result of operation should they occur more frequently and with greater severity however the uncertain nature of potential change of extreme weather event such increased frequency duration and severity the long period of time over which any potential change might take place and the inability to predict these with any degree of accuracy make estimating any potential future financial risk to the duke energy registrant operation impossible currently the duke energy registrant plan and prepare for potential extreme weather event such ice storm tornado hurricane severe thunderstorm high wind and drought the duke energy registrant routinely take step to reduce the potential impact of severe weather event on their electric distribution system the duke energy registrant electric generating facility are designed to withstand extreme weather event without significant damage the duke energy registrant maintain an inventory of coal and oil on site to mitigate the effect of any potential short term disruption in fuel supply so they can continue to provide customer with an uninterrupted supply of electricity the subsidiary registrant have program in place to effectively manage the impact of future drought on operation nuclear mattersfollowing the event at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station in japan duke energy conducted thorough inspection at each of it seven nuclear site during the initial inspection did not identify any significant vulnerability however duke energy is reviewing design to evaluate safety margin to external event emergency response capability written procedure and engineering specification were reviewed to verify each site ability to respond in the unlikely event of beyond design basis event duke energy is working within the nuclear industry to improve safety standard and margin using the three layer of safety approach used in the protection mitigation and emergency response emergency equipment ha been added or is in the process of being added at each station to perform key safety function in the event that backup power source are lost and are not expected to be restored within specified period of time these improvement are in addition to the numerous layer of safety measure and system previously in place in march the nrc formed task force to conduct comprehensive review of process and regulation to determine whether the agency should make additional improvement to the nuclear regulatory system on july the task force proposed set of improvement designed to ensure protection enhance accident mitigation strengthen emergency preparedness and improve efficiency of nrc program the recommendation were further prioritized into three tier based on the safety enhancement level on march the nrc issued three regulatory order requiring safety enhancement related to mitigation strategy to respond to extreme natural event resulting in the loss of power at plant ensuring reliable hardened containment vent and enhancing spent fuel pool instrumentation on august the nrc issued implementation guidance to enable power plant to achieve compliance with the order issued in march plant were required to submit implementation plan to the nrc by february and complete implementation of the safety enhancement within two refueling outage or by december whichever come first each plant is also required to reassess their seismic and flooding hazard using present day method and information conduct inspection to ensure protection against hazard in the current design basis and re evaluate emergency communication system and staffing level duke energy is committed to compliance with all safety enhancement ordered by the nrc in connection with the march regulatory order noted above the cost of which could be material until such time the nrc mandated reassessment of flooding and seismic hazard is complete the exact scope and cost of compliance modification to duke energy site will not be known with the nrc continuing review of the remaining recommendation duke energy can not predict to what extent the nrc will impose additional licensing and safety related requirement or the cost of complying with such requirement upon receipt of additional guidance from the nrc and collaborative industry review duke energy will be able to determine an implementation plan and associated cost see item risk factor for further discussion of

is the exchange price to sell an asset or transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date the fair value definition focus on an exit price versus the acquisition cost fair value measurement use market data or assumption market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumption about risk and the risk inherent in the input to the valuation technique these input may be readily observable corroborated by market data or generally unobservable valuation technique maximize the use of observable input and minimize use of unobservable input midmarket pricing convention the midpoint price between bid and ask price is permitted for use practical expedient fair value measurement are classified in three level based on the fair value hierarchy level unadjusted quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date an active market is one in which transaction for an asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide ongoing pricing information level fair value measurement utilizing input other than quoted price included in level that are observable either directly or indirectly for an asset or liability input include quoted price for similar asset or liability in active market ii quoted price for identical or similar asset or liability in market that are not active iii and input other than quoted market price that are observable for the asset or liability such interest rate curve and yield curve observable at commonly quoted interval volatility and credit spread level measurement can not have more than an insignificant portion of it valuation based on unobservable input instrument in this category include non exchange traded derivative such over the counter forward swap and option certain marketable debt security and financial instrument traded in le than active market level any fair value measurement which includes unobservable input for more than an insignificant portion of the valuation these input may be used with internally developed methodology that result in management best estimate of fair

recognize transfer between level of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the period there were no transfer between level and during the year ended december and transfer out of level during the year ended december were the result of forward commodity price becoming observable due to the passage of time valuation method of the primary fair value measurement disclosed below are follows investment in equity securitiesthe majority of investment in equity security are valued using level measurement investment in equity security are typically valued at the closing price in the principal active market of the last business day of the quarter principal active market for equity price include published exchange such nasdaq and new york stock exchange nyse foreign equity price are translated from their trading currency using the currency exchange rate in effect at the close of the principal active market there wa no after hour market activity that wa required to be reflected in the reported fair value measurement investment in debt securitiesmost investment in debt security are valued using level measurement because the valuation use interest rate curve and credit spread applied to the term of the debt instrument maturity and coupon interest rate and consider the counterparty credit rating if the market for particular fixed income security is relatively inactive or illiquid the measurement is level commodity derivativescommodity derivative with clearinghouses are classified level other commodity derivative are primarily valued using internally developed discounted cash flow model which incorporate forward price adjustment for liquidity bid ask spread and credit or non performance risk after reflecting credit enhancement such collateral and are discounted to present value pricing input are derived from published exchange transaction price and other observable data source in the absence of an active market the last available price may be used if forward price curve are not observable for the full term of the contract and the unobservable period had more than an insignificant impact on the valuation the commodity derivative is classified level in isolation increase decrease in natural gas forward price result in favorable unfavorable fair value adjustment for gas purchase contract and increase decrease in electricity forward price result in unfavorable favorable fair value adjustment for electricity sale contract duke energy regularly evaluates and validates pricing input used to estimate the fair value of gas commodity contract by market participant price verification procedure this procedure provides comparison of internal forward commodity curve to market participant generated curve interest rate derivativesmost over the counter interest rate

crc amount included in receivables in the above table for duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana reflect their retained interest in receivables sold to crc these subordinated note held by duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana are stated at fair value carrying value of retained interest are determined by allocating carrying value of the receivables between asset sold and interest retained based on relative fair value the allocated base of the subordinated note are not materially different than their face value because the receivables generally turnover in le than two month ii credit loss are reasonably predictable due to the broad customer base and lack of significant concentration and iii the equity in crc is subordinate to all retained interest and thus would absorb loss first the hypothetical effect on fair value of the retained interest assuming both percent and percent unfavorable variation in credit loss or discount rate is not material due to the short turnover of receivables and historically low credit loss history interest accrues to duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana on the retained interest using the acceptable yield method this method generally approximates the stated rate on the note since the allocated basis and the face value are nearly equivalent an impairment charge is recorded against the carrying value of both retained interest and
