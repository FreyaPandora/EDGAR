other competitor to address specific customer requirement bd expects the trend of strong competition to continue of contentsregulatory mattersour business are heavily regulated in of our market we deal with numerous government agency and entity including not limited to all of the branch of the military nasa the federal aviation administration faa and the department of homeland security similar government authority exist in our international market government contract the government and other government may terminate any of our government contract at their convenience well for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirement if any of our government contract were to be terminated for convenience we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation cost if any of our government contract were to be terminated for default generally the government would pay for the work that ha been accepted and could require to pay the difference the original contract price and the cost to re procure the contract item net of the work accepted from the original contract the government also hold liable for damage resulting from the default commercial aircraft in the our commercial aircraft product are required to comply with faa regulation governing production and quality system airworthiness and installation approval repair procedure and continuing operational safety internationally similar requirement exist for airworthiness installation and operational approval these requirement are generally administered by the national aviation authority of each country and in the case of europe coordinated by the european joint aviation authority environmental we are subject to various federal state local and non law and regulation relating to environmental protection including the discharge treatment storage disposal and remediation of hazardous substance and waste we continually ass our compliance status and management of environmental matter to ensure our operation are in compliance with all applicable environmental law and regulation investigation remediation and operation and maintenance cost associated with environmental compliance and management of site are normal recurring part of our operation these cost often are allowable cost under our contract with the government it is reasonably possible that cost incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have material impact on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow if additional work requirement or stringent clean standard are imposed by regulator new area of soil air and groundwater contamination are discovered and or expansion of work scope are prompted by the result of investigation potentially responsible party prp ha joint and several liability under existing environmental law we have been designated prp by the environmental protection agency or state environmental agency we are potentially liable to the government or third party for the full cost of remediating contamination at our facility or former facility or at third party site if we were required to fully fund the remediation of site for which we were originally assigned partial share the statutory framework would allow to pursue right to contribution from other prps for additional information relating to environmental contingency see note to our consolidated financial statement international our international sale are subject to and non governmental regulation and procurement policy and practice including regulation relating to import export control investment exchange control anti corruption and repatriation of earnings international sale are also subject to varying currency political and economic risk raw material part and subassemblieswe are highly dependent on the availability of essential material part and subassemblies from our supplier and subcontractor the most important raw material required for our aerospace product are of contentsaluminum sheet plate forging and extrusion titanium sheet plate forging and extrusion and composite including carbon and boron although alternative source generally exist for these raw material qualification of the source could take year or more many major component and product equipment item are procured or subcontracted on sole source basis with number of company supplierswe are dependent upon the ability of large number of and non supplier and subcontractor to meet performance specification quality standard and delivery schedule at our anticipated cost while we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third party failure of supplier or subcontractor to meet commitment could adversely affect production schedule and program contract profitability thereby jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitment to our customer we are also dependent on the availability of energy source such electricity at affordable price seasonalityno material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal executive officer

relating to our future financial condition and operating result well any other statement that not directly relate to any historical or current fact forward looking statement are based on expectation and assumption that we believe to be reasonable made but that may not prove to be accurate these statement are not guarantee and are subject to risk uncertainty and change in circumstance that are difficult to predict many factor including of contentsthose set forth in the risk factor section below and other important factor disclosed in this report and from time to time in our other filing with the sec could cause actual result to differ materially and adversely from these forward looking statement any forward looking statement speaks only of the date on which it is made and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statement whether result of new information future event or otherwise except required by law item risk factorsan investment in our common stock or debt security involves risk and uncertainty and our actual result and future trend may differ materially from our past or projected future performance we urge investor to consider carefully the risk factor described below in evaluating the information contained in this report our commercial airplane business depends heavily on commercial airline and is subject to unique risk market condition have significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft the commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long term trend in airline passenger and cargo traffic the principal factor underlying long term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging market demand for our commercial aircraft is influenced by airline profitability availability of aircraft financing world trade policy government to government relation technological change price and other competitive factor fuel price terrorism epidemic and environmental regulation traditionally the airline industry ha been cyclical and competitive and ha experienced significant profit swing and constant challenge to be more cost competitive in addition availability of financing to non customer depends in part on the continued operation of the export import bank of the united state significant deterioration in the global economic environment the airline industry generally or in the financial stability of one or more of our major customer could result in fewer new order for aircraft or could cause customer to seek to postpone or cancel contractual order and or payment to which could result in lower revenue profitability and cash flow and reduction in our contractual backlog in addition our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery period of several year any of these macroeconomic industry or customer impact could unexpectedly affect delivery over long period we enter into firm fixed price aircraft sale contract with indexed price escalation clause which could subject to loss if we have cost overrun or if increase in our cost exceed the applicable escalation rate commercial aircraft sale contract are often entered into year the aircraft are delivered in order to account for economic fluctuation between the contract date and delivery date aircraft pricing generally consists of fixed amount modified by price escalation formula derived from labor commodity and other price index our revenue estimate are based on current expectation with respect to these escalation formula but the actual escalation amount are outside of our control escalation factor can fluctuate significantly from period to period change in escalation amount can significantly impact revenue and operating margin in our commercial airplane business we derive significant portion of our revenue from limited number of commercial airline we can make no assurance that any customer will exercise purchase option fulfill existing purchase commitment or purchase additional product or service from in addition fleet decision airline consolidation or financial challenge involving any of our major commercial airline customer could significantly reduce our revenue and limit our opportunity to generate profit from those customer of contentsour commercial airplane business depends on our ability to maintain healthy production system achieve planned production rate target successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standard the commercial aircraft business is extremely complex involving extensive coordination and integration with and non supplier highly skilled labor from thousand of employee and other partner and stringent regulatory requirement and performance and reliability standard in addition the introduction of new aircraft program and or derivative such the max and involves increased risk associated with meeting development testing production and certification schedule result our ability to deliver aircraft on time satisfy regulatory and customer requirement and achieve or maintain applicable program profitability is subject to significant risk we must minimize disruption caused by production change and achieve productivity improvement in order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability we have plan to adjust production rate on several of our commercial aircraft program while at the time engaging in significant ongoing development and production of the max and aircraft in addition we continue to seek opportunity to reduce the cost of building our aircraft including working with our supplier to reduce supplier cost identifying and implementing productivity improvement and optimizing we manage inventory if production rate ramp up effort at any of our commercial aircraft assembly facility are delayed if other production rate change result in significant disruption to our production system or if our supplier can not timely deliver component to at the cost and rate necessary to achieve our target we may be unable to meet delivery schedule and the financial performance of one or more of our program may suffer operational challenge impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft program could result in production delay and or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft either of which would negatively impact our revenue and operating margin our commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex operational issue including delay or defect in supplier component failure to meet internal performance plan or delay or failure to achieve required regulatory certification could result in significant of sequence work and increased production cost well delayed delivery to customer impact to aircraft performance and or increased warranty or fleet support cost further if we can not efficiently and cost effectively incorporate design change into early build aircraft we may face further profitability pressure on this program if our commercial airplane fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirement we could face additional cost and or lower revenue developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standard well those of customer and regulatory agency can be costly and technologically challenging these challenge are particularly significant with newer aircraft program any failure of any boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirement could result in disruption to our operation higher cost and or lower revenue change in level of government defense spending or overall acquisition priority could negatively impact our financial position and result of operation we derive substantial portion of our revenue from the government primarily from defense related program with the dod level of defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factor such the political environment foreign policy macroeconomic condition and the ability of the government to enact relevant legislation such authorization and appropriation bill in addition significant budgetary delay and constraint have already resulted in reduced spending level and additional reduction may be forthcoming the budget control act of the act established limit on government discretionary spending including reduction of defense spending between the of contentsand government fiscal year accordingly long term uncertainty remains with respect to overall level of defense spending and it is likely that government discretionary spending level will continue to be subject to pressure in addition there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to program level appropriation for the dod and other government agency including nasa within the overall budgetary framework described while the house and senate appropriation committee included funding for boeing major program in such ch chinook ah apache kc tanker and program uncertainty remains about how defense budget in and beyond will affect boeing program future budget cut including cut mandated by sequestration or future procurement decision associated with the authorization and appropriation process could result in reduction cancellation and or delay of existing contract or program any of these impact could have material effect on the result of the company operation financial position and or cash flow in addition result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both defense spending level and the nature of the threat environment we expect the dod to continue to emphasize cost cutting and other efficiency initiative in it procurement process if we can no longer adjust successfully to these changing acquisition priority and or fail to meet affordability target set by the dod customer our revenue and market share would be further impacted we conduct significant portion of our business pursuant to government contract which are subject to unique risk in of our revenue were earned pursuant to government contract which include foreign military sale through the government business conducted pursuant to such contract is subject to extensive procurement regulation and other unique risk our sale to the government are subject to extensive procurement regulation and change to those regulation could increase our cost new procurement regulation or change to existing requirement could increase our compliance cost or otherwise have material impact on the operating margin of our bd business these requirement may result in increased compliance cost and we could be subject to additional cost in the form of withheld payment and or reduced future business if we fail to comply with these requirement in the future compliance cost attributable to current and potential future procurement regulation such these could negatively impact our financial condition and operating result the government may modify curtail or terminate one or more of our contract the government contracting party may modify curtail or terminate it contract and subcontract with without prior notice and either at it convenience or for default based on performance in addition funding pursuant to our government contract may be reduced or withheld part of the congressional appropriation process due to fiscal constraint change in national security strategy and or priority or other reason further uncertainty with respect to ongoing program could also result in the event that the government finance it operation through temporary funding measure such continuing resolution rather full year appropriation any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and or modification curtailment or termination of one or more large program could have material adverse effect on our earnings cash flow and or financial position we are subject to government inquiry and investigation including periodic audit of cost that we determine are reimbursable under government contract government agency including the defense contract audit agency and the defense contract management agency routinely audit government contractor these agency review our performance under contract cost structure and compliance with applicable law regulation and standard well the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control system and policy any cost found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to of contentsspecific contract will be deemed non reimbursable and to the extent already reimbursed must be refunded any inadequacy in our system and policy could result in withholds on billed receivables penalty and reduced future business furthermore if any audit inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activity we could be subject to civil and criminal penalty and administrative sanction including termination of contract forfeiture of profit suspension of payment fine and suspension or debarment from business with the government we also could suffer reputational harm if allegation of impropriety were made even if such allegation are later determined to be false we enter into fixed price contract which could subject to loss if we have cost overrun our bd business generated approximately of it revenue from fixed price contract while fixed price contract enable to benefit from performance improvement cost reduction and efficiency they also subject to the risk of reduced margin or incurring loss if we are unable to achieve estimated cost and revenue if our estimated cost exceed our estimated price we recognize reach forward loss which can significantly affect our reported result for example during we recorded reach forward loss of million on the usaf kc tanker contract primarily driven by additional cost attributable to design change testing and manufacturing complexity the long term nature of many of our contract make the process of estimating cost and revenue on fixed price contract inherently risky fixed price contract often contain price incentive and penalty tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impact on margin in addition of our contract have specific provision relating to cost schedule and performance fixed price development contract are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed price production contract many of these development program have highly complex design in addition technical or quality issue that arise during development could lead to schedule delay and higher cost to complete which could result in material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition example of significant bd fixed price development contract include commercial crew saudi usaf kc tanker and commercial and military satellite we enter into cost type contract which also carry risk our bd business generated approximately of it revenue from cost type contracting arrangement some of these are development program that have complex design and technical challenge these cost type program typically have award or incentive fee that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended period in these case the associated financial risk are primarily in reduced fee lower profit rate or program cancellation if cost schedule or technical performance issue arise program whose contract are primarily cost type include gmd proprietary and sl program we enter into contract that include in orbit incentive payment that subject to risk contract in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contract include in orbit incentive payment these in orbit payment may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance in both case the in orbit incentive payment is at risk if the satellite doe not perform to specification for up to year after acceptance the net present value of in orbit incentive fee we ultimately expect to realize is recognized revenue in the construction period if the satellite fails to meet contractual performance criterion customer will not be obligated to continue making in orbit payment and or we may be required to provide refund to the customer and incur significant charge of contentsour ability to deliver product and service that satisfy customer requirement is heavily dependent on the performance of our subcontractor and supplier well on the availability of raw material and other component we rely on other company including and non subcontractor and supplier to provide and produce raw material integrated component and sub assembly and production commodity and to perform some of the service that we provide to our customer if one or more of our supplier or subcontractor experience delivery delay or other performance problem we may be unable to meet commitment to our customer or incur additional cost in addition if one or more of the raw material on which we depend such aluminum titanium or composite becomes unavailable or is available only at very high price we may be unable to deliver one or more of our product in timely fashion or at budgeted cost in some instance we depend upon single source of supply any service disruption from one of these supplier either due to circumstance beyond the supplier control such geo political development or result of performance problem or financial difficulty could have material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitment to our customer or increase our operating cost for example we continue to monitor political unrest involving russia and ukraine where we and some of our supplier source titanium product and or have operation we use estimate in accounting for many contract and program change in our estimate could adversely affect our future financial result contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risk estimating revenue and cost and making assumption for schedule and technical issue due to the size and nature of many of our contract and program the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variable assumption have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because cost also include expected increase in wage and employee benefit material price and allocated fixed cost incentive or penalty related to performance on contract are considered in estimating sale and profit rate and are recorded when there is sufficient information for to ass anticipated performance supplier assertion are also assessed and considered in estimating cost and profit rate estimate of award fee are also used in sale and profit rate based on actual and anticipated award with respect to each of our commercial aircraft program inventoriable production cost including overhead program tooling and other non recurring cost and routine warranty cost are accumulated and charged cost of sale by program instead of by individual unit or contract program consists of the estimated number of unit accounting quantity of product to be produced in continuing long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contract limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimate to establish the relationship of sale to cost of sale program accounting requires estimate of the number of unit to be produced and sold in program the period over which the unit can reasonably be expected to be produced and the unit expected sale price production cost program tooling and other non recurring cost and routine warranty cost for the total program several factor determine accounting quantity including firm order letter of intent from prospective customer and market study change to customer or model mix production cost and rate learning curve change to price escalation index cost of derivative aircraft supplier performance customer and supplier negotiation settlement supplier claim and or certification issue can impact these estimate any such change in estimate relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financial performance because of the significance of the judgment and estimation process described above materially different sale and profit amount could be recorded if we used different assumption or if the underlying circumstance were to change change in underlying assumption circumstance or estimate may adversely affect future period financial performance for additional information on our accounting policy for recognizing sale and profit see our discussion under management discussion and analysis of contentscritical accounting policy contract accounting program accounting on page and note to our consolidated financial statement on page of this form competition within our market and with respect to the product we sell may reduce our future contract and sale the market in which we operate are highly competitive and one or more of our competitor may have more extensive or more specialized engineering manufacturing and marketing capability than we do in some area in our commercial airplane business we anticipate increasing competition among non aircraft manufacturer and service provider in one or more of our market segment in our bd business we anticipate that the effect of defense industry consolidation fewer large and new program and new priority including near and long term cost competitiveness of our dod and international customer will intensify competition for many of our product and service furthermore we are facing increased international competition and cross border consolidation of competition there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitor or that the competitive pressure we face will not result in reduced revenue and market share we derive significant portion of our revenue from non sale and are subject to the risk of doing business in other country in non customer accounted for approximately of our revenue we expect that non sale will continue to account for significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future result we are subject to risk of doing business internationally including change in regulatory requirement domestic and international government policy including requirement to expend portion of program fund locally and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirement fluctuation in international currency exchange rate volatility in international political and economic environment and change in non national priority and budget which can lead to delay or fluctuation in order the complexity and necessity of using non representative and consultant the uncertainty of the ability of non customer to finance purchase including the availability of financing from the export import bank of the united state uncertainty and restriction concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantee imposition of domestic and international tax export control tariff embargo sanction and other trade restriction the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many country compliance with variety of international law well law affecting the activity of company abroad and unforeseen development and condition including terrorism war epidemic and international tension and conflict while the impact of these factor is difficult to predict any one or more of these factor could adversely affect our operation in the future of contentsthe outcome of litigation and of government inquiry and investigation involving our business is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have material effect on our financial position and result of operation we are involved in number of litigation matter these matter may divert financial and management resource that would otherwise be used to benefit our operation no assurance can be given that the result of these matter will be favorable to an adverse resolution of any of these lawsuit could have material impact on our financial position and result of operation in addition we are subject to extensive regulation under the law of the united state and it various state well other jurisdiction in which we operate result we are sometimes subject to government inquiry and investigation of our business due among other thing to our business relationship with the government the heavily regulated nature of our industry and in the case of environmental proceeding our current or past ownership of certain property any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against which could have material impact on our financial position and result of operation significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customer and in certain type of boeing aircraft which expose to concentration risk significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customer and in distinct geographic region our portfolio is also concentrated by varying degree across boeing aircraft product type most notably and aircraft and among customer that we believe have le than investment grade credit if one or more customer holding significant portion of our portfolio asset experience financial difficulty or otherwise default on or doe not renew it lease with at their expiration and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonable term or if the type of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected decline in value our earnings cash flow and or financial position could be materially adversely affected we may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operation and contractual commitment at competitive rate on commercially reasonable term or in sufficient amount we depend in part upon the issuance of debt to fund our operation and contractual commitment of december and our airplane financing commitment totaled million and million if we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitment or meet other business requirement our market liquidity may not be sufficient number of factor could cause to incur increased borrowing cost and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private market for debt these factor include disruption or decline in the global capital market and or decline in our financial performance outlook or credit rating the occurrence of any or all of these event may adversely affect our ability to fund our operation and contractual or financing commitment we may not realize the anticipated benefit of merger acquisition joint venture strategic alliance or divestiture part of our business strategy we may merge with or acquire business and or form joint venture and strategic alliance whether we realize the anticipated benefit from these acquisition and related activity depends in part upon our ability to integrate the operation of the acquired business the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operation accordingly our financial result could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issue legacy liability transaction related charge amortization of expense related to intangible charge for impairment of long term asset credit guarantee partner performance and indemnification consolidation of joint venture could also impact our reported result of operation or financial position while we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedure and process to mitigate these risk there is no assurance that these transaction will be successful we of contentsalso may make strategic divestiture from time to time these transaction may result in continued financial involvement in the divested business such through guarantee or other financial arrangement following the transaction nonperformance by those divested business could affect our future financial result through additional payment obligation higher cost or asset write down our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposure we are exposed to liability that are unique to the product and service we provide we maintain insurance for certain risk and in some circumstance we may receive indemnification from the government the amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claim or liability and we may be forced to bear substantial cost for example liability arising from the use of certain of our product such aircraft technology missile system border security system anti terrorism technology and or air traffic management system may not be insurable on commercially reasonable term while some of these product are shielded from liability within the under the safety act provision of the homeland security act no such protection is available outside the potentially resulting in significant liability the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover these or other claim or liability business disruption could seriously affect our future sale and financial condition or increase our cost and expense our business may be impacted by disruption including threat to physical security information technology or cyber attack or failure damaging weather or other act of nature and pandemic or other public health crisis any of these disruption could affect our internal operation or our ability to deliver product and service to our customer any significant production delay or any destruction manipulation or improper use of our data information system or network could impact our sale increase our expense and or have an adverse effect on the reputation of boeing and of our product and service some of our and our supplier workforce are represented by labor union which may lead to work stoppage approximately employee which constitute of our total workforce were union represented of december we experienced work stoppage in when labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain bma program production we may experience additional work stoppage in the future which could adversely affect our business we can not predict how stable our relationship currently with labor organization and non labor organization will be or whether we will be able to meet the union requirement without impacting our financial condition the union may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce union action at supplier can also affect work stoppage and instability in

airline operating in the middle east and asia pacific region well low cost carrier globally are currently leading passenger growth air cargo traffic growth is estimated at approximately in the sluggish air cargo market recovery ha resulted in reduced order and demand for new freighter aircraft and freighter conversion airline financial performance also play role in the demand for new capacity airline continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliance partnership new marketing initiative and effective leveraging of ancillary service and related revenue airline are also relentlessly focusing on reducing cost by renewing fleet to leverage more efficient airplane and in benefited significantly from lower fuel cost net profit for the global airline industry are estimated to be approximately billion in airline profit are expected to be slightly lower than at approximately billion the long term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental driver of air travel growth economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade globalization and improved airline service driven by liberalization of air traffic right between country our year forecast project long term average growth rate of per year for passenger traffic and for cargo traffic based on long term projection of average annual gdp growth we project trillion market for approximately new airplane over the next year however we continue to monitor near term market condition in the wide body segment the industry remains vulnerable to near term exogenous development including fuel price spike credit market shock terrorism natural disaster conflict epidemic and increased global environmental regulation industry competitiveness the commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive market liberalization in europe the middle east and asia is enabling low cost airline to continue gaining market share these airline are increasing the pressure on airfare this result in continued cost pressure for all airline and price pressure on our product major productivity gain are essential to ensure favorable market position at acceptable profit margin continued access to global market remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sale potential and long term investment return approximately of commercial airplane contractual backlog in dollar term is with airline including cargo carrier we face aggressive international competitor who are intent on increasing their market share they offer competitive product and have access to most of the same customer and supplier with government support airbus ha historically invested heavily to create family of product to compete with regional jet maker embraer and bombardier coming from the le than seat commercial jet market continue to develop larger and increasingly capable airplane additionally other competitor from russia china and japan are developing commercial jet aircraft in the market above seat some of these competitor of contentshave historically enjoyed access to government provided financial support including launch aid which greatly reduces the commercial risk associated with airplane development activity and enables airplane to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible this market environment ha resulted in intense pressure on pricing and other competitive factor and we expect these pressure to continue or intensify in the coming year worldwide airplane sale are generally conducted in dollar fluctuating exchange rate affect the profit potential of our major competitor all of have significant cost in other currency change in value of the dollar relative to their local currency impact competitor revenue and profit many competitor are expected to benefit from the strong dollar experienced in and ongoing improvement in efficiency which may result in funding product development

been used extensively for flight and ground testing and we intended to begin to refurbish the aircraft in early for commercial sale based on sale activity and market interest however during the second quarter of we determined that firm order for these aircraft prior to refurbishment were now unlikely and that the company would not invest company fund for their refurbishment the company also determined the cost to refurbish the aircraft at future date would be prohibitively expensive we therefore determined that the aircraft were not commercially saleable and accordingly cost of million associated with these aircraft were reclassified from program inventory to research and development expense during the second quarter of we have firm order for the five remaining undelivered early build aircraft and plan to complete retrofitting them by the end of the combination of production challenge change incorporation on early build aircraft schedule delay customer and supplier impact and

compared with an expense of million and million in and the benefit reflects the difference between the higher segment allocation compared to the gaap net periodic pension cost recognized in earnings

core earnings per share non gaap weighted average diluted share in million the income tax impact is calculated using the tax rate in effect for the non gaap adjustment of contentscritical accounting policiescontract accountingcontract accounting is used to determine revenue cost of sale and profit predominantly by our bd business contract accounting involves judgmental process of estimating the total sale and cost for each contract which result in the development of estimated cost of sale percentage for each contract the amount reported cost of sale is determined by applying the estimated cost of sale percentage to the amount of revenue recognized due to the size duration and nature of many of our contract the estimation of total sale and cost through completion is complicated and subject to many variable total contract sale estimate are based on negotiated contract price and quantity modified by our assumption regarding contract option change order incentive and award provision associated with technical performance and price adjustment clause such inflation or index based clause the majority of these contract are with the government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit federal acquisition regulation provide guidance on the type of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price total contract cost estimate are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract term historical performance trend business base and other economic projection factor that influence these estimate include inflationary trend technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trend business volume assumption asset utilization and anticipated labor agreement revenue and cost estimate for all significant contract are reviewed and reassessed quarterly change in these estimate could result in recognition of cumulative catch up adjustment to the contract inception to date revenue cost of sale and profit in the period in which such change are made change in revenue and cost estimate could also result in reach forward loss or an adjustment to reach forward loss which would be recorded immediately in earnings for the year ended december and net unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustment including reach forward loss across all contract decreased earnings from operation by million and million for the year ended december net favorable cumulative catch up adjustment including reach forward loss across all contract increased earnings from operation by million due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is likely that materially different cost of sale amount could be recorded if we used different assumption or if the underlying circumstance were to change change in underlying assumption estimate supplier performance or circumstance may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future period if the combined gross margin for all contract in bd for all of had been estimated to be higher or lower by it would have increased or decreased pre tax income for the year by approximately million in addition number of our fixed price development contract are in reach forward loss position change to estimated loss are recorded immediately in earnings program accountingprogram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sale to cost for the defined program accounting quantity program consists of the estimated number of unit accounting quantity of product to be produced in continuing long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contract the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimate of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contract for each program the amount reported cost of sale is determined by applying the estimated cost of sale percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sale recognized for airplane delivered and accepted by the customer of contentsfactors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity sale price labor and employee benefit cost material cost procured part cost major component cost overhead cost program tooling and other non recurring cost and warranty cost estimation of the accounting quantity for each program take into account several factor that are indicative of the demand for the particular program such firm order letter of intent from prospective customer and market study total estimated program sale are determined by estimating the model mix and sale price for all unsold unit within the accounting quantity added together with the sale price for all undelivered unit under contract the sale price for all undelivered unit within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly cost estimate are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contract with supplier historical performance trend and business base and other economic projection factor that influence these estimate include production rate internal and subcontractor performance trend customer and or supplier claim or assertion asset utilization anticipated labor agreement and inflationary or deflationary trend to ensure reliability in our estimate we employ rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on quarterly basis change in estimate are normally recognized on prospective basis when estimated cost to complete program exceed estimated revenue from undelivered unit in the accounting quantity loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered unit in the accounting quantity the program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non recurring and production cost over the accounting quantity for each program because of the higher unit production cost experienced at the beginning of new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non recurring cost new commercial aircraft program such the and program typically have lower initial margin than established program in addition actual cost incurred for earlier unit in excess of the estimated average cost of all unit in the program accounting quantity are included within program inventory deferred production cost deferred production unamortized tooling and other non recurring cost are expected to be fully recovered when all unit in the accounting quantity are delivered the expected unit cost for later delivery is below the estimated average cost learning curve and other improvement are realized due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is reasonably possible that change in underlying circumstance or assumption could have material effect on program gross margin if the combined gross margin percentage for our commercial airplane program had been estimated to be higher or lower it would have similar effect on the commercial airplane segment operating margin for the year ended december increase or decrease in operating margin for our commercial airplane segment would have million impact on operating earnings the program wa in reach forward loss position at december and delivery of in were recorded at zero margin and absent change in estimated revenue or cost future delivery will be recorded at zero margin reduction to the estimated loss in subsequent period are spread over all undelivered unit in the accounting quantity whereas increase to the estimated loss are recorded immediately an additional reach forward loss it is reasonably possible that we could make decision to terminate the program which may result in additional reach forward loss which may be material the program had near breakeven margin during if we are unable to mitigate risk associated with the and program or if our assumption with respect to item such pricing cost or future production rate were to change we could be required to record reach forward loss which could have material effect on our reported result of contentsgoodwill and indefinite lived intangible impairmentswe test goodwill for impairment by performing qualitative assessment or using two step impairment process if we choose to perform qualitative assessment we evaluate economic industry and company specific factor an initial step in assessing the fair value of operation if we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net asset is more than the fair value of the related operation the two step impairment process is performed otherwise no further testing is required for operation where the two step impairment process is used we first compare the book value of net asset to the fair value of the related operation if the fair value is determined to be le than book value second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment in this process fair value for goodwill is estimated based in part on the fair value of the operation and is compared to it carrying value the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment we estimate the fair value of the related operation using discounted cash flow forecast of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future sale and operating cost based primarily on existing firm order expected future order contract with supplier labor agreement and general market condition change in these forecast could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded if any the cash flow forecast are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus suitable control premium at the date of evaluation therefore change in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded if any we completed our assessment of goodwill of april and determined that there is no impairment of goodwill of december we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded it corresponding carrying value change in our forecast or decrease in the value of our common stock could cause book value of certain operation to exceed their fair value which may result in goodwill impairment charge in future period of december and we had million of indefinite lived intangible asset related to the jeppesen and aviall brand and trade name acquired in business combination we test these intangible for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projection of discounted cash flow attributable to the brand and trade name any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flow represents the amount of the impairment decrease in the discounted cash flow would not impact the carrying value of these indefinite lived intangible asset pension plansthe majority of our employee have earned benefit under defined benefit pension plan nonunion and the majority of union employee that had participated in defined benefit pension plan transitioned to company funded defined contribution retirement saving plan in accounting rule require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan asset these measurement are based upon several assumption including the discount rate and the expected long term rate of asset return future change in

ratedecrease bpspension plan projected benefit obligation periodic pension cost expense is also sensitive to change in the expected long term rate of asset return decrease or increase of basis point in the expected long term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased net periodic pension expense by million we expect net periodic pension cost to decrease by approximately million and the portion recognized in earnings to decrease by approximately million primarily due to lower service cost and amortization of actuarial loss othersection of the iran threat reduction and syria human

rate change historically we have not experienced material gain or loss on our customer financing asset and liability due to interest rate change of december the impact over the next month of basis point rise in interest rate to our pre tax earnings would not be significant the investor in our fixed rate debt obligation do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligation prior

remain substantially unchanged the standard requires modified retrospective transition approach for existing lease whereby the new rule will be applied to the earliest year presented we do not expect the new lease standard to have material effect on our financial position result of operation or cash flow we plan to implement asu no revenue from contract with customer in the first quarter of this comprehensive new standard will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance and require revenue to be recognized when promised good or service are transferred to customer in amount that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those good or service the standard also requires expanded disclosure regarding revenue and contract with customer the guidance permit two implementation approach one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior year and one requiring prospective application of the new standard with disclosure of result under old standard the company plan to adopt the new standard effective january and apply it retrospectively to all period presented we are analyzing the impact of the new standard on the company revenue contract comparing our current accounting policy and practice to the requirement of the new standard and identifying potential difference that would result from applying the new standard to our contract we are also identifying and of contentsimplementing change to the company business process system and control to support adoption of the new standard in and recasting prior period financial information we expect adoption of the new standard will have material impact on our income statement and balance sheet but are unable to quantify those impact at this time we currently expect that most of our bd contract that currently recognize revenue delivery are made or based on the attainment of performance milestone will recognize revenue under the new standard cost are incurred certain military derivative aircraft contract in our commercial airplane business will also recognize revenue cost are incurred the new standard will not change the total amount of revenue recognized on these contract only accelerate the timing of when the revenue is recognized we expect corresponding acceleration in timing of cost of sale recognition for these contract resulting in decrease in inventory from long term contract in progress upon adoption of the new standard we do not expect the new standard to affect revenue recognition or the use of program accounting for commercial airplane contract in our commercial airplane business we will continue to recognize revenue for these contract at the point in time when the customer accepts delivery of the airplane from balance sheet perspective we expect adoption of the new standard will increase total asset and total liability because netting of advance from customer against inventory will no longer be permitted this will result in an increase in the advance liability and inventory from commercial aircraft program upon adoption of the new standard use of estimatesmanagement make assumption and estimate to prepare financial statement in conformity with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america those assumption and estimate directly affect the amount reported in the consolidated financial statement significant estimate for which change in the near term are considered reasonably possible and that may have material impact on the financial statement are disclosed in these note to the consolidated financial statement operating cyclefor classification of certain current asset and liability we use the duration of the related contract or program our operating cycle which is generally longer than one year revenue and related cost recognitioncontract accounting contract accounting is used for development and production activity predominantly by defense space security bd the majority of business conducted by bd is performed under contract with the government and other customer that extend over several year contract accounting involves judgmental process of estimating total sale and cost for each contract resulting in the development of estimated cost of sale percentage for each contract the amount reported cost of sale is determined by applying the estimated cost of sale percentage to the amount of revenue recognized when the current estimate of total sale and cost for contract indicate loss provision for the entire loss on the contract is recognized change in estimated revenue cost of sale and the related effect on operating income are recognized using cumulative catch up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the change on current and prior period based on contract percent complete in and net unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustment including reach forward loss across all contract decreased earnings from operation by and and diluted eps by and in net favorable cumulative catch up adjustment including reach forward loss across all contract increased earnings from operation by and diluted eps by significant adjustment during the three of contentsyears ended december included reach forward loss of and on the usaf kc tanker contract recorded during and we combine contract for accounting purpose when they are negotiated package with an overall profit margin objective these essentially represent an agreement to do single project for single customer involve interrelated construction activity with substantial common cost and are performed concurrently or sequentially when group of contract is combined revenue and profit are earned uniformly over the performance of the combined contract similarly we may segment single contract or group of contract when clear economic decision ha been made during contract negotiation that would produce different rate of profitability for each element or phase of the contract sale related to fixed price contract are recognized delivery are made except for certain fixed price contract that require substantial performance over an extended period before delivery begin for which sale are recorded based on the attainment of performance milestone sale related to contract in which we are reimbursed for cost incurred plus an agreed upon profit are recorded cost are incurred the federal acquisition regulation provide guidance on the type of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price contract may contain provision to earn incentive and award fee if specified target are achieved incentive and award fee that can be reasonably estimated and are probable are recorded over the performance period of the contract incentive and award fee that can not be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded program accounting our commercial airplane segment predominantly us program accounting to account for cost of sale related to it program program accounting is applicable to product manufactured for delivery under production type contract where profitability is realized over multiple contract and year under program accounting inventoriable production cost program tooling and other non recurring cost and warranty cost are accumulated and charged to cost of sale by program instead of by individual unit or contract program consists of the estimated number of unit accounting quantity of product to be produced in continuing long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contract the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimate of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contract to establish the relationship of sale to cost of sale program accounting requires estimate of the number of unit to be produced and sold in program the period over which the unit can reasonably be expected to be produced and the unit expected sale price production cost program tooling and other non recurring cost and routine warranty cost for the total program we recognize sale for commercial airplane delivery each unit is completed and accepted by the customer sale recognized represent the price negotiated with the customer adjusted by an escalation formula specified in the customer agreement the amount reported cost of sale is determined by applying the estimated cost of sale percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sale recognized for airplane delivered and accepted by the customer change in estimated revenue cost of sale and the related effect on program margin are recognized prospectively except in case where the program is determined to have reach forward loss in which case the loss is recognized in the current period see note concession sharing arrangement we account for sale concession to our customer in consideration of their purchase of product and service reduction to revenue when the related product and service are delivered the sale concession incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain supplier in accordance with concession sharing arrangement we record these reimbursement which are presumed to represent reduction in the price of the vendor product or service reduction in cost of product spare part revenue we recognize sale of spare part upon delivery and the amount reported cost of sale is recorded at average cost of contentsservice revenue service revenue is recognized when the service is performed with the exception of government service agreement which are accounted for using contract accounting service activity primarily include support agreement associated with military aircraft and helicopter contract space travel on commercial crew ongoing maintenance of international space station and technical and flight operation service for commercial aircraft service revenue and associated cost of sale from pay in advance subscription fee are deferred and recognized service are rendered financial service revenue we record financial service revenue associated with sale type finance lease operating lease and note receivable lease and financing revenue arrangement are included in sale of service on the consolidated statement of operation for sale type finance lease we record an asset at lease inception this asset is recorded at the aggregate future minimum lease payment estimated residual value of the leased equipment and deferred incremental direct cost le unearned income income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate level rate of return on the net investment residual value which are reviewed periodically represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the leased equipment actual residual value realized could differ from these estimate decline in estimated residual value that are deemed other than temporary are recognized in the period in which the decline occur for operating lease revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on straight line basis over the term of the lease operating lease asset included in customer financing are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period that we project we will hold the asset to an estimated residual value using the straight line method we periodically review our estimate of residual value and recognize forecasted change by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense for note receivable note are recorded net of any unamortized discount and deferred incremental direct cost interest income and amortization of any discount are recorded ratably over the related term of the note reinsurance revenue our wholly owned insurance subsidiary astro ltd participates in reinsurance pool for worker compensation the member agreement and practice of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating member individual risk reinsurance revenue were and during

statement of operation fleet supportwe provide assistance and service to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation to the operator of all our commercial airplane model collectively known fleet support service these activity and service include flight and maintenance training field service support engineering service and technical data and document fleet support activity begin prior to aircraft delivery the customer receives training manual and technical consulting support this activity continues throughout the aircraft operational life service provided after delivery include field service support consulting on maintenance repair and operational issue brought forth by the customer or regulator updating manual and engineering data and the issuance of service bulletin that impact the entire model fleet field service support involves our personnel located at customer facility providing and coordinating fleet support activity and request the cost for fleet support are expensed incurred cost of service of contentsresearch and developmentresearch and development includes cost incurred for experimentation design and testing well bid and proposal effort related to government product and service which are expensed incurred unless the cost are related to certain contractual arrangement with customer cost that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangement are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized consistent with our contract accounting policy we have certain research and development arrangement that meet the requirement for best effort research and development accounting accordingly the amount funded by the customer are recognized an offset to our research and development expense rather than contract revenue research and development expense included bid and proposal cost of and in and respectively we have established cost sharing arrangement with some supplier for the program our cost sharing arrangement state that the supplier contribution are for reimbursement of cost we incur for experimentation basic design and testing activity during the development in each arrangement we retain substantial right to the part or component covered by the arrangement the amount received from these cost sharing arrangement are recorded reduction to research and development expense since we have no obligation to refund any amount received per the arrangement regardless of the outcome of the development effort specifically under the term of each agreement payment received from supplier for their share of the cost are typically based on milestone and are recognized earned when we achieve the milestone event and no ongoing obligation on our part exists in the event we receive milestone payment prior to the completion of the milestone the amount is classified in accrued liability until earned share based compensationwe provide various form of share based compensation to our employee for award settled in share we measure compensation expense based on the grant date fair value net of estimated forfeiture for award settled in cash or that may be settled in cash we measure compensation expense based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeiture the expense is recognized over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period of the award income taxesprovisions for federal state and non income tax are calculated on reported earnings before income tax based on current tax law and also include in the current period the cumulative effect of any change in tax rate from those used previously in determining deferred tax asset and liability such provision differ from the amount currently receivable or payable because certain item of income and expense are recognized in different time period for financial reporting purpose than for income tax purpose significant judgment is required in determining income tax provision and evaluating tax position the accounting for uncertainty in income tax requires more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return we record liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purpose and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return to the extent that our assessment of such tax position change the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made tax related interest and penalty are classified component of income tax expense of contentspostretirement plansthe majority of our employee have earned benefit under defined benefit pension plan nonunion and the majority of union employee that had participated in defined benefit pension plan transitioned to company funded defined contribution retirement saving plan in we also provide postretirement benefit plan other than pension consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retiree and qualifying dependent benefit under the pension and other postretirement benefit plan are generally based on age at retirement and year of service and for some pension plan benefit are also based on the employee annual earnings the net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plan is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumption the most significant of which are the discount rate the long term rate of asset return and medical trend rate of growth for medical cost portion of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production product cost and reflected in inventory at the end of reporting period actuarial gain and loss which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumption are reflected in shareholder equity net of tax if actuarial gain and loss exceed ten percent of the greater of plan asset or plan liability we amortize them over the average future service period of employee the funded status of our pension and postretirement plan is reflected on the consolidated statement of financial position postemployment planswe record liability for postemployment benefit such severance or job training when payment is probable the amount is reasonably estimable and the obligation relates to right that have vested or accumulated environmental remediationwe are subject to federal and state requirement for protection of the environment including those for discharge of hazardous material and remediation of contaminated site we routinely ass based on in depth study expert analysis and legal review our contingency obligation and commitment for remediation of contaminated site including assessment of range and probability of recovery from other responsible party and or insurance carrier our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposure related to environmental remediation site when it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated the amount of the liability is based on our best estimate or the low end of range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation cleanup and monitoring cost to be incurred estimated remediation cost are not discounted to present value the timing of payment can not be reasonably estimated we may be able to recover portion of the remediation cost from insurer or other third party such recovery are recorded when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable cash and cash equivalentscash and cash equivalent consist of highly liquid instrument such commercial paper time deposit and other money market instrument which have original maturity of three month or le we aggregate our cash balance by bank where condition for right of set off are met and reclassify any negative balance consisting mainly of uncleared check to account payable

tooling and other non recurring cost and applicable overhead which includes fringe of contentsbenefits production related indirect and plant management salary and plant service not in excess of estimated net realizable value to the extent material amount of such cost are related to an abnormal event or are fixed cost not appropriately attributable to our program or contract they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried inventoried cost include amount relating to program and contract with long term production cycle portion of which is not expected to be realized within one year included in inventory for federal government contract is an allocation of allowable cost related to manufacturing process reengineering commercial aircraft program inventory includes deferred production cost and supplier advance deferred production cost represent actual cost incurred for production of early unit that exceed the estimated average cost of all unit in the program accounting quantity higher production cost are experienced at the beginning of new or derivative airplane program unit produced early in program require substantially more effort labor and other resource than unit produced later in program because of volume efficiency and the effect of learning we expect that these deferred cost will be fully recovered when all unit included in the accounting quantity are delivered the expected unit cost for later delivery is below the estimated average cost of all unit in the program supplier advance represent payment for part we have contracted to receive from supplier in the future part are received supplier advance are amortized to work in process the determination of net realizable value of long term contract cost is based upon quarterly review that estimate cost to be incurred to complete all contract requirement when actual contract cost and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenue loss provision is recorded the determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program cost is based upon quarterly program review that estimate revenue and cost to be incurred to complete the program accounting quantity when estimated cost to complete exceed estimated program revenue to go program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered unit in the accounting quantity used aircraft purchased by the commercial airplane segment and general stock material are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value see aircraft valuation within this note for discussion of our valuation of used aircraft spare part inventory is stated at lower of average unit cost or net realizable value we review our commercial spare part and general stock material quarterly to identify impaired inventory including excess or obsolete inventory based on historical sale trend expected production usage and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part impaired inventory are charged to cost of product in the period the impairment occurs included in inventory for commercial aircraft program are amount paid or credited in cash or other consideration to certain airline customer that are referred to early issue sale consideration early issue sale consideration is recognized reduction to revenue when the delivery of the aircraft under contract occurs if an airline customer doe not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft we believe that we would have the ability to recover amount paid however to the extent early issue sale consideration exceeds advance and is not considered to be otherwise recoverable it would be written off in the current period we net advance and progress billing on long term contract against inventory in the consolidated statement of financial position advance and progress billing in excess of related inventory are reported in advance and billing in excess of related cost precontract costswe may from time to time incur cost in excess of the amount required for existing contract if we determine the cost are probable of recovery from future order then we capitalize the precontract cost we incur excluding start up cost which are expensed incurred capitalized precontract cost are included in inventory net of advance and progress billing in the accompanying consolidated of

useful life new building and land improvement from to year and new machinery and equipment from to year the principal method of depreciation are follows building and land improvement declining balance and machinery and equipment sum of the year digit capitalized internal use software is included in other asset and amortized using the straight line method over year we periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable life assigned to long lived asset including asset that may be subject to management plan for disposition long lived asset held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value le cost to sell long lived asset held for use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flow of the asset the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset asset retirement obligationswe record all known asset retirement obligation for which the liability fair value can be reasonably estimated including certain asbestos removal asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligation recorded amount are not material we also have known conditional asset retirement obligation such certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activity to be performed in the future that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation accordingly these obligation have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statement liability for these obligation will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make reasonable estimate of the liability fair value in addition there may be conditional asset retirement obligation that we have not yet discovered asbestos may exist in certain building but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business and therefore these obligation also have not been included in the consolidated financial statement goodwill and other acquired intangiblesgoodwill and other acquired intangible asset with indefinite life are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstance change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist our annual testing date is april we test goodwill for impairment by performing qualitative assessment or using two step impairment process if we choose to perform qualitative assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net asset is more than the fair value of the related operation the two step impairment process is then performed otherwise no further testing is required for operation where the two step impairment process is used we first compare the carrying value of net asset to the fair value of the related operation if the fair value is determined to be le than carrying value second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment in this process fair value for goodwill is estimated based in part on the fair value of the operation and is compared to it carrying value the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment of contentsindefinite lived intangible consist of brand and trade name acquired in business combination we test these intangible for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projection of discounted cash flow attributable to the brand and trade name any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flow represents the amount of the impairment our finite lived acquired intangible asset are amortized on straight line basis over their estimated useful life follows developed technology from to year product know how from to year customer base from to year distribution right from to year and other from to year we evaluate the potential impairment of finite lived acquired intangible asset whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flow of the asset the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset investmentstime deposit are held to maturity investment that are carried at cost available for sale security include commercial paper treasury and government agency security and corporate debt security available for sale security are recorded at fair value and unrealized gain and loss are recorded net of tax component of accumulated other comprehensive income realized gain and loss on available for sale security are recognized based on the specific identification method available for sale security are assessed for impairment quarterly the equity method of accounting is used to account for investment for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over an investee significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between and we classify investment income and loss on our consolidated statement of operation based on whether the investment is operating or non operating in nature operating investment align strategically and are integrated with our operation earnings from operating investment including our share of income or loss from equity method investment dividend income from certain cost method investment and any impairment or gain loss on the disposition of these investment are recorded in income from operating investment net non operating investment are those we hold for non strategic purpose earnings from non operating investment including interest and dividend on marketable security and any impairment or gain loss on the disposition of these investment are recorded in other income expense net derivativesall derivative instrument are recognized in the financial statement and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them we use derivative instrument to principally manage variety of market risk for derivative designated hedge of the exposure to change in fair value of the recognized asset or liability or firm commitment referred to fair value hedge the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged the effect of that accounting is to include in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting change in fair value for our cash flow hedge the effective portion of the derivative gain or loss is initially reported in comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period or period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affect earnings the ineffective portion of the gain or loss of cash flow hedge is reported in earnings immediately we have agreement to purchase and sell aluminum to address long term strategic sourcing objective and international business requirement these agreement are derivative for accounting purpose but are not designated for hedge accounting treatment we also hold certain derivative instrument for economic purpose that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment for these of contentsaluminum agreement and for other derivative instrument not designated for hedge accounting treatment the change in their fair value are recorded in earnings immediately aircraft valuationused aircraft under trade in commitment and aircraft under repurchase commitment in conjunction with signing definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft sale aircraft we have entered into trade in commitment with certain customer that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at specified price upon the purchase of sale aircraft additionally we have entered into contingent repurchase commitment with certain customer wherein we agree to repurchase the sale aircraft at specified price generally to year after delivery of the sale aircraft our repurchase of the sale aircraft is contingent upon future mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft if we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft and if the customer exercise it right to sell the sale aircraft to contingent repurchase commitment would become trade in commitment our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitment infrequently become trade in commitment exposure related to trade in commitment may take the form of adjustment to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of the fair value of the trade in aircraft of the date of such agreement which would be recognized upon delivery of the sale aircraft and or charge to cost of product for adverse change in the fair value of trade in aircraft that occur subsequent to signing of definitive agreement for sale aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade in aircraft estimate based on current aircraft value would be included in accrued liability the fair value of trade in aircraft is determined using aircraft specific data such model age and condition market condition for specific aircraft and similar model and multiple valuation source this process us our assessment of the market for each trade in aircraft which in most instance begin year before the return of the aircraft there are several possible market in which we continually pursue opportunity to place used aircraft these market include but are not limited to the resale market which could potentially include the cost of long term storage the leasing market with the potential for refurbishment cost to meet the leasing customer requirement or the scrap market trade in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft on quarterly basis we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activity associated with placing each aircraft into market or using current published third party aircraft valuation based on the type and age of the aircraft adjusted for individual attribute and known condition used aircraft acquired by the commercial airplane segment are included in inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value it is our intent to sell these asset to mitigate cost and enhance marketability aircraft may be placed on operating lease while on operating lease the asset are included in customer financing customer financing customer financing includes operating lease equipment note receivable and sale type finance lease sale type finance lease are treated receivables and allowance for loss are established necessary we ass the fair value of the asset we own including equipment under operating lease asset held for sale or re lease and collateral underlying receivables to determine if their fair value are le than the related asset carrying value difference between carrying value and fair value of sale type finance lease and note and other receivables determined by collateral value are considered in determining the allowance for loss on receivables of contentswe use median calculated from published collateral value from multiple third party aircraft value publication based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft under certain circumstance we apply judgment based on the attribute of the specific aircraft or equipment usually when the feature or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attribute covered by outside publication impairment review for asset under operating lease and held for sale or re lease we evaluate for impairment asset under operating lease or asset held for sale or re lease when event or change in circumstance indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be le than the carrying value we use various assumption when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including our intention for how long we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold the expected future lease rate lease term residual value of the asset period in which the asset may be held in preparation for follow on lease maintenance cost remarketing cost and the remaining economic life of the asset we record asset held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value le cost to sell when we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset allowance for loss on customer financing receivables we record the potential impairment of customer financing receivables in valuation account the balance of which is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed loss the allowance for loss on receivables relates to two component of receivables receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment and all other receivables we determine receivable is impaired when based on current information and event it is probable that we will be unable to collect amount due according to the original contractual term of the receivable agreement without regard to any subsequent restructurings factor considered in assessing collectability include but are not limited to customer extended delinquency request for restructuring and filing for bankruptcy we determine specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral we would expect to realize we review the adequacy of the allowance attributable to the remaining receivables after excluding receivables subject to specific impairment allowance by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate collateral exposure for particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure the applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two component customer credit rating and weighted average remaining contract term internally assigned credit rating our credit quality indicator are determined for each customer in the portfolio those rating are updated based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customer we have entered into agreement with certain customer that would entitle to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable for purpose of determining the collateral exposure described above should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable creating shortfall condition these agreement would for example permit to take the action necessary to sell or retain certain other asset in which the customer ha an equity interest and use the proceeds to cover the shortfall each quarter we review customer credit rating published historical credit default rate for different rating category and multiple third party aircraft value publication basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for loss on receivables there can be no assurance that actual result will not differ from estimate or that the consideration of these factor in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance for loss on receivables of contentswarrantiesin conjunction with certain product sale we provide warranty that cover factor such non conformance to specification and defect in material and design the majority of our warranty are issued by our commercial airplane segment generally aircraft sale are accompanied by three to four year standard warranty for system accessory

commitment beyond the standard warranty obligation to correct fleet wide major issue of particular model resulting in additional accrued warranty expense warranty issued by our bd segment principally relate to sale of military aircraft and weapon hardware and are included in the contract cost estimate these sale are generally accompanied by six month to two year warranty period and cover system accessory equipment part and software manufactured by to certain contractual specification estimated cost related to standard warranty are recorded in the period in which the related product sale occur the warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of month of warranty coverage outstanding for product delivered time the average of historical monthly warranty payment well additional amount for certain major warranty issue that exceed normal claim level estimated cost of these additional warranty issue are considered change to the initial liability

specified performance target and anticipated settlement when contractual remedy are not specified estimated payment are recorded reduction of revenue at delivery of the related aircraft we have agreement that require certain supplier to compensate for amount paid to customer for failure of supplied equipment to meet specified performance target claim against supplier under these agreement are included in inventory and recorded reduction in cost of product at delivery of the related aircraft these performance warranty and claim against supplier are included in the program estimate at completion supplier penaltieswe record an accrual for supplier penalty when an event occurs that make it probable that supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable until an

modified after december for residual value guarantee where we received cash premium the liability is equal to the cash premium received at the guarantee inception for credit guarantee the liability is equal to the present value of the expected loss we determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditor default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery if applicable for each future period the credit guarantee will be outstanding if at inception of guarantee we determine there is probable related contingent loss we will recognize liability for the greater of the fair value

united state government defense environment overviewthe new administration and key member of the congress have expressed general desire to reverse the effect of the budgetary reduction of the past

continued risk of future sequestration cut in addition there continues to be uncertainty with respect to program level appropriation for the department of defense dod and other government agency including the national aeronautics and space administration nasa within the overall budgetary framework described above future budget cut or investment priority change could result in reduction cancellation and or delay of existing contract or program any of these impact could have material effect on the result of the company operation financial position and or cash flow funding timeliness also remains risk the federal government is currently operating under continuing resolution that expires on april if congress is unable to pas appropriation bill before the continuing resolution expires government shutdown could result which may have impact above and beyond those resulting from budget cut sequestration impact or program level appropriation for example requirement to furlough employee in the dod or other government agency could result in payment delay impair our ability to perform work on existing contract and or negatively impact future order bd fixed price development contractsfixed price development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimate of the cost and time required to complete the work bd fixed price contract with significant development work include commercial crew saudi usaf kc tanker and commercial and military satellite the operational and technical complexity of these contract create financial risk which could trigger termination provision order cancellation or other financially significant exposure change to cost and revenue estimate could result in lower margin or material charge for reach forward

pricing pressure and fewer order than anticipated result during we canceled previous plan to return to production rate of aircraft per month beginning in resulting in reduction in the program

resulted in reach forward loss of in the second quarter we previously recognized reach forward loss of and during the second half of and the first quarter of respectively related to the prior decision to reduce the production rate to per month and lower estimated revenue from future sale due to ongoing pricing and market pressure we reduced the rate from to per month in september the adjusted

of production challenge change incorporation on early build aircraft schedule delay customer and supplier impact and change to price escalation factor ha created significant pressure on program

various maturity point bond with the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yield are omitted portfolio of about bond is used to construct the yield curve since corporate bond yield are generally not available at maturity beyond year it is assumed that spot rate will remain level beyond that year point the present value of each plan benefit is calculated by applying the discount rate
