through it participation in the craf program fedex express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business fedex express together with consortium of other carrier currently contract

could affect our business ground the ground transportation performed by fedex express is integral to it air transportation service the enactment of the federal aviation administration authorization act of abrogated the authority of state to regulate the rate route or service of intermodal all cargo air carrier and most motor carrier state may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance fedex express is registered in those state that require registration the operation of fedex ground fedex freight and fedex custom critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by

addition vehicle weight and dimension remain subject to both federal and state regulation international fedex express international authority permit it to carry cargo and mail from point in it route

the right of carrier to serve foreign point is subject to the dot approval and generally requires bilateral agreement between the and the foreign government in addition the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flight and service the regulatory environment for global aviation right may from time to time impair the ability of fedex express to operate it air network in the most efficient manner and efficient operation often utilize open sky provision of aviation agreement additionally global air cargo carrier such fedex express are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by and foreign government our operation outside of the such fedex express international domestic operation are also subject to current and potential regulation including certain postal regulation and licensing requirement that restrict make difficult and sometimes prohibit the ability of foreign owned company such fedex express to compete effectively in part of the international domestic transportation and logistics market communication because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facility in it aircraft and ground transportation operation fedex express is subject to the federal communication commission act of amended additionally the federal communication commission fcc regulates and license fedex express activity pertaining to satellite communication and also manages the spectrum allocation and licensing process the fcc recently expanded the use of the to gigahertz ghz spectrum band which ha historically been reserved for aviation to support the implementation of cellular network across the in december following concern of potential interference with aircraft radio altimeter by the expanded use of the to ghz spectrum band the faa issued airworthiness directive prohibiting aircraft operator from operating at airport affected by cellular network unless authorized via an alternative mean of compliance fedex express air operation have continued to operate with minimal interruption due to the faa issuance of alternative mean of compliance based on voluntary mitigation agreed to by the telecommunication company implementing cellular network while the voluntary mitigation remain in effect of july the telecommunication company are expected to fully implement cellular network over the course of the next calendar year accordingly it is possible that the faa may take additional action to address aviation safety concern related to implementation which could adversely affect fedex express domestic air operation we continue to engage with the faa and other industry stakeholder on this issue environmental pursuant to the federal aviation act the faa with the assistance of the environmental protection agency epa is authorized to establish standard governing aircraft noise fedex express aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standard of the federal aviation regulation in addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise certain airport operator have local noise regulation which limit aircraft operation by type of aircraft and time of day these regulation have had restrictive effect on fedex express aircraft operation in some of the locality where they apply but do not have material effect in any of fedex express significant market congress passage of the airport noise and capacity act of established national noise policy which enabled fedex express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraint fedex express international operation are also subject to noise regulation in certain of the country in which it operates concern over climate change including the impact of global warming ha led to significant and international legislative and regulatory effort to limit ghg emission including our aircraft and vehicle engine emission increasingly state and local government are also considering ghg regulatory requirement compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various country and region are following different approach to the regulation of climate change for example the eu ha established the emission trading system ets to regulate ghg emission in the eu and adopted directive in requiring each eu member state to extend the ets to aviation operation effort by the eu in to regulate flight arriving from or departing for airport outside of the eu were postponed the eu extended it stay on the extra territorial application of the eu ets applied to international flight to and from the european economic area eea through the end of calendar contingent on successful implementation of the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation corsia in the international civil aviation organization icao passed resolution adopting corsia which is global market based measure for purchasing credit to offset carbon dioxide emission and intended to aid in meeting the icao goal of carbon neutral growth starting in calendar by complementing industry effort in infrastructure upgrade technology operation and sustainable aviation fuel in june the icao adopted standard pertaining to country by country implementation including the collection and reporting of information on international aviation emission beginning in calendar in furtherance of these effort in the faa issued notice of corsia program enabling carrier to submit emission data used to set the initial global industry emission baseline beginning in calendar requirement commenced for carrier subject to corsia to offset international aviation emission above the industry baseline by purchasing and retiring eligible carbon credit and or utilizing sustainable aviation fuel in response to the creation of the corsia program in december the eu adopted proposal that indefinitely excludes from the ets flight operating fully or partly outside the eu and gradually reduces the number of aviation allowance from calendar the eu ha indicated that it will ass corsia implementation and determine the future status of the ets applied to international aviation to and from the eea we expect compliance with corsia to increase fedex operating expense the amount of such increase will ultimately depend on number of factor including the number of our flight subject to corsia the fuel efficiency of our fleet the average growth of the aviation sector our ability to utilize sustainable aviation fuel in the future and the price of icao eligible emission unit or offset required to be purchased by fedex additionally in calendar the epa issued finding that aircraft engine ghg emission cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare in icao adopted new carbon dioxide emission standard that would apply not only to new aircraft type of calendar but also to new delivery of current in production aircraft type from calendar additionally cutoff date of calendar for production of aircraft that do not comply with proposed standard wa adopted these standard are considered to be especially stringent for larger aircraft weighing over ton in the epa adopted it own aircraft and aircraft engine ghg emission standard which are aligned with the icao emission standard in the past the congress ha also considered bill that would regulate ghg emission and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future in the reentered the paris climate accord an agreement among country to reduce ghg emission the effect of the reentry on future policy regarding ghg emission and on other ghg regulation is uncertain additionally the extent to which other country implement that agreement could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business we are also subject to international federal state and local environmental law and regulation relating to among other thing the shipment of dangerous good and contingency planning for spill of petroleum product additionally we are subject to numerous regulation dealing with underground fuel storage tank hazardous waste handling vehicle and equipment emission and noise and the discharge of effluent from our property and equipment fedex express ha an environmental management system based on international standardization designed to maintain compliance with these regulation and minimize our operational environmental footprint export control in recent year the government ha increased the number of company and person subject to export control regulation such regulation can restrict the type of item that fedex customer are permitted to ship to certain entity and in some instance may prohibit fedex from serving certain entity altogether violation of these regulation can result in significant monetary and other penalty for example the export control reform act of the ecra and it implementing regulation the export administration regulation the ear hold carrier such fedex strictly liable for shipment that may violate the ear without requiring evidence that the carrier had knowledge of any violation violation of the ecra can result in criminal penalty of up to million and civil penalty of or twice the value of the transaction per individual violation fedex is investing in improvement and update to it export control compliance program however the heightened focus on export control by the government increase fedex exposure to potential regulatory penalty and could result in higher compliance cost in june fedex filed suit in district court in the district of columbia seeking to enjoin the department of commerce the doc from enforcing prohibition contained in the ear against fedex fedex belief that the ear violate common carrier right to due process under the fifth amendment of the constitution they unreasonably hold common carrier strictly liable for shipment that may violate the ear without requiring evidence that the carrier had knowledge of any violation in september the court granted the doc motion to dismiss the lawsuit in november we appealed this decision on july the court of appeal for the district of columbia circuit affirmed the dismissal of the lawsuit custom our activity including custom brokerage and freight forwarding are subject to

labor act of amended the rla while labor relation within the at our other company are governed by the national labor relation act of amended the nlra under the rla group that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide class of employee the rla also requires mandatory government led mediation of contract dispute supervised by the national mediation board union can strike or an employer can replace employee or impose contract term this part of the rla help minimize the risk of strike that would shut large portion of the economy under the nlra employee can unionize in small localized group and government led mediation is not required step in the negotiation process the rla wa originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiation transportation system evolved the law expanded to cover airline which are the dominant national transportation system of today an air express carrier with an integrated air ground network fedex express and it employee have been covered by the rla since the founding of the company the purpose of the rla is to offer employee process by which to unionize if they choose and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppage and delay specifically the rla ensures that an entire transportation system such at fedex express can not be shut down by the action of local segment of the network the congress ha in the past considered adopting change in labor law that would make it easier for union to organize unit of our employee for example there is always possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employee from the jurisdiction of the rla thereby exposing the fedex express network to sporadic labor dispute and the risk that small group of employee could disrupt the entire air ground network in addition federal and state governmental agency such the national mediation board and the national labor relation board nlrb have and may continue to take action that could make it easier for our employee and employee of service provider contracting with fedex ground to organize under the rla or nlra for description of these and other potential labor law change see item risk factor of this annual report data protection there ha recently been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus relating to the collection use retention transfer and processing of personal data in the at both the state and federal level and internationally for more information regarding data protection regulation see item risk factor of this annual report item risk factor in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report you should carefully consider the following factor which could materially affect our business result of operation financial condition and the price of our common stock additional risk not currently known to or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business result of operation financial condition and the price of our common stock macroeconomic and market risk we are directly affected by the state of the global economy and geopolitical development while macroeconomic risk apply to most company we are particularly vulnerable the transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trend in economic activity our primary business is to transport good so our business level are directly tied to the purchase and production of good and the rate of growth of global trade key macroeconomic measurement influenced by among other thing inflation and deflation supply chain disruption interest rate and currency exchange rate labor cost and unemployment level fuel and energy price public health crisis inventory level buying pattern and disposable income debt level and credit availability when individual and company purchase and produce fewer good we transport fewer good and company move manufacturing closer to consumer market and expand the number of distribution center we transport good shorter distance certain manufacturer and retailer are making investment to produce and house good in closer proximity to supply chain and consumer in connection with recent macroeconomic geopolitical and public health development additionally consumer spending ha shifted from good to service we expect these trend to continue further we have relatively high fixed cost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume level moreover given the nature of our business and our global operation political economic and other condition in foreign country and region including international tax government to government relation the typically more volatile economy of emerging market and geopolitical risk such the current conflict between russia and ukraine may adversely affect our business and result of operation we have suspended all service in ukraine russia and belarus which ha not had and is not expected to have material impact on our business or result of operation the broader consequence of this conflict which may include further sanction embargo regional instability and geopolitical shift airspace ban relating to certain route or strategic decision to alter certain route potential retaliatory action by the russian government against company including result of the suspension of service in russia including nationalization of foreign business in russia increased tension between the united state and country in which we operate and the extent of the conflict effect on our business and result of operation well the global economy can not be predicted to the extent the current conflict between russia and ukraine adversely affect our business it may also have the effect of heightening many other risk disclosed in this annual report any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and result of operation such risk include but are not limited to disruption to our global technology infrastructure including through cyberattack ransom attack or cyber intrusion adverse change in international trade policy our ability to maintain or increase our price including our fuel surcharge in response to rising fuel cost our ability to implement and execute our business strategy particularly with regard to our fedex express international business disruption in global supply chain which can limit the access of fedex and our service provider to vehicle and other key capital resource and increase our cost and could affect our ability to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operation by calendar our ability to maintain our strong reputation and the value of the fedex brand terrorist activity targeting transportation infrastructure our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation and constraint volatility or disruption in the capital market geopolitical uncertainty negatively impacted operation at fedex express in we expect slowing economic condition during additionally we incurred higher cost due to labor market challenge in and we expect such condition to continue to be present in for more information see our failure to attract and retain employee talent or maintain our company culture well increase in labor and purchased transportation cost could adversely impact our business and result of operation below and item management discussion and analysis of result of operation and financial condition of this annual report additional change in international trade policy and relation could significantly reduce the volume of good transported globally and adversely affect our business and result of operation the government ha taken certain action that have negatively impacted trade including imposing tariff on certain good imported into the additionally several foreign government have imposed tariff on certain good imported from the these action contributed to weakness in the global economy that adversely affected our result of operation in recent year any further change in or international trade policy including tariff export control quota embargo or sanction could trigger additional retaliatory action by affected country resulting in trade war and further increased cost for good transported globally which may reduce customer demand for these product if the party to pay tariff or other anti trade measure increase their price or in trading partner limiting their trade with country that impose such measure political uncertainty surrounding international trade and other dispute could also have negative effect on business and consumer confidence and spending such condition could have an adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition well on the price of our common stock additionally the government ha taken action to limit the ability of domestic company to engage in commerce with certain foreign entity under certain circumstance and foreign government may investigate our compliance with these restriction furthermore given the nature of our business and our global recognizability foreign government may target fedex by limiting the ability of foreign entity to do business with in certain instance imposing monetary or other penalty or taking other retaliatory action which could have an adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition well on the price of our common stock our transportation business are impacted by the price and availability of jet and vehicle fuel we must purchase large quantity of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicle and the price and availability of fuel is beyond our control and can be highly volatile in addition our purchased transportation expense is impacted by fuel cost to date we have been mostly successful in mitigating over time the expense impact of higher fuel cost through our indexed fuel surcharge the amount of the surcharge is closely linked to the market price for fuel if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharge because of competitive pricing pressure or some other reason fuel cost could adversely impact our operating result see item management discussion and analysis of result of operation and financial condition of this annual report for more information of may we had no derivative financial instrument to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuation even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharge high fuel surcharge could move our customer away from our higher yielding express service to our lower yielding deferred or ground service or even reduce customer demand for our service altogether in addition disruption in the supply of fuel could have negative impact on our ability to operate our transportation network the following factor may impact fuel supply and could result in shortage and price increase in the future weather related event natural disaster political disruption or war involving oil producing country economic sanction imposed against oil producing country or specific industry participant change in governmental policy concerning fuel production transportation tax or marketing change in refining capacity environmental concern cyberattacks and public and investor sentiment several of these factor combined to constrain fuel supply and increase price in and we expect such condition to continue to be present in operating risk significant data breach or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could disrupt our operation and result in the loss of critical confidential information adversely impacting our reputation business or result of operation our ability to attract and retain customer to efficiently operate our business and to compete effectively depends in part upon the sophistication security and reliability of our technology network including our ability to provide feature of service that are important to our customer to protect our confidential business information and the information provided by our customer and to maintain customer confidence in our ability to protect our system and to provide service consistent with their expectation for example we rely on information technology to receive package level information in advance of physical receipt of package to track item that move through our delivery system to efficiently plan delivery to execute billing process and to track and report financial and operational data we are subject to risk imposed by data breach and operational disruption including through cyberattack or cyber intrusion by computer hacker foreign government cyber terrorist and activist cyber criminal malicious employee or other insider of fedex or third party service provider and other group and individual data breach of company and government continue to increase the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attack and intrusion from around the world have increased and we our customer and third party increasingly store and transmit data by mean of connected information technology system additionally risk such code anomaly act of god transitional challenge in migrating operating company functionality to our fedex enterprise automation platform data leakage cyber fraud and human error pose direct threat to our product service system and data and could result in unauthorized or block legitimate access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operation customer employee and supplier including personal information the technology infrastructure of acquired business well their practice related to the use and maintenance of data could also present issue that we were not able to identify prior to the acquisition see failure to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to change in market dynamic and customer preference will cause our future financial result to suffer below for additional information on risk related to shoprunner and fedex dataworks we also depend on and interact with the technology and system of third party including our customer and third party service provider such cloud service provider and delivery service such third party may host process or have access to information we maintain about our company customer employee and vendor or operate system that are critical to our business operation and service like these third party are subject to risk imposed by data breach cyberattacks and other event or action that could damage disrupt or close down their network or system we have security process protocol and standard in place including contractual provision requiring such security measure that are applicable to such third party and are designed to protect information that is held by them or to which they have access result of their engagement with nevertheless cyberattack could defeat one or more of such third party security measure allowing an attacker to obtain information about our company customer employee and vendor or disrupt our operation these third party may also experience operational disruption or human error that could result in unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operation customer employee and supplier including personal information disruption to our complex global technology infrastructure including those impacting our computer system and website could result in the loss of confidential business or customer information require substantial repair or replacement resulting in significant cost and lead to the temporary or permanent transfer by customer of some or all of their business to our competitor the foregoing could harm our reputation and adversely impact our operation customer service and result of operation additionally security breach could require to devote significant management resource to address the problem created these type of adverse impact could also occur in the event the confidentiality integrity or availability of company and customer information wa compromised due to data loss by fedex or trusted third party we or the third party with which we share information may not discover any security breach and loss of information for significant period of time the security breach occurs we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiative information technology risk management business continuity and disaster recovery plan including investment to retire and replace end of life system the development and maintenance of these measure is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating technology change and effort to overcome security measure become increasingly more frequent intense and sophisticated despite our effort we are not fully insulated from data breach technology disruption data loss and cyber fraud which could adversely impact our competitiveness and result of operation see item risk factor of our annual report on form for the year ended may for information regarding the notpetya cyberattack at tnt express and immaterial cyber incident we experienced in and additionally we have experienced continual attempt by cyber criminal some of which have been successful to gain access to customer account for the purpose of fraudulently diverting and misappropriating item being transported in our network none of these fraudulent cyber activity caused material disruption to our system or resulted in any material cost to fedex while we have significant security process and initiative in place we may be unable to detect or prevent breach or disruption in the future additionally while we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspect of cyber risk in place such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all loss or all type of claim that may arise see our business is subject to complex and evolving and foreign law and regulation regarding data protection below for additional information on risk related to legal and regulatory development with respect to data protection the continuing impact of the covid pandemic on our business result of operation and financial condition is highly unpredictable since late the covid pandemic ha had varying impact on the demand for our service our business operation and the global economy and supply chain there is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which covid will continue to spread in certain region of the world and the extent and duration of measure to try to contain the virus such travel ban and restriction quarantine shelter in place order business and government shutdown and other restriction this uncertainty is expected to continue to impact our business in the covid pandemic negatively impacted our operating result in global recovery from the impact of the covid pandemic slowed with the onset of new variant which resulted in reduced shipping demand and caused network disruption particularly at fedex express our business is labor and capital intensive in nature which ha required to incur higher cost to operate our network during the pandemic if we are unable to remain agile and continue to flex our network to align with shipping volume customer need disrupted global supply chain and other network inefficiency market demand and operating condition or are unable to continuously respond to evolving governmental policy for the duration of prolonged period of economic recovery our business operation could be negatively impacted which could have further adverse effect on our result of operation we have also incurred increased operating expense related to personal protective equipment and medical safety supply well additional security and cleaning service in order to protect our team member and customer due to the size scope and geographically dispersed nature of our operation the expense we incur to protect the health and safety of certain of our employee may be higher than similar expense incurred by company in other industry additionally significant number of our employee well customer and others with we do business continue to work remotely in response to the covid pandemic our business operation may be disrupted and we may experience increased risk of adverse effect on our business if significant portion of our workforce or certain business operation are negatively impacted result of remote work arrangement including due to cyber risk or other disruption to our technology infrastructure the continuing impact of the covid pandemic including the extent of it effect on our business result of operation and financial condition well the global economy will be dictated by future development that remain uncertain and can not be predicted such it duration and spread the success of effort to contain it and treat it impact the possibility of additional subsequent widespread outbreak and variant strain and the impact of action taken in response resulting effect on the economic condition in the global market in which we operate the future rate of commerce growth and the timeline for recovery of passenger airline cargo capacity to the extent the covid pandemic continues to adversely affect our business and financial result it may also have the effect of heightening many other risk described in this section any of which could materially and adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition such risk include but are not limited to additional change in the state of the global economy and international trade policy and relation our ability to implement our business strategy and effectively respond to change in market dynamic and customer preference our strong reputation and the value of the fedex brand our ability to meet our labor and purchased transportation need while controlling related cost our ability to execute and effectively operate integrate leverage and grow acquired business change in the business and financial soundness of the usps our ability to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operation by calendar and the impact of litigation or claim from customer team member supplier regulator or other third party relating to the covid pandemic or our action in response to the pandemic for more information about the covid pandemic and it effect on our business result of operation and financial condition see item management discussion and analysis of result of operation and financial condition result of operation and outlook consolidated result of this annual report we are self insured for certain cost associated with our operation and insurance and claim expense could have material adverse effect on we are self insured up to certain limit that vary by type of risk for cost associated with worker compensation claim vehicle accident property and cargo loss general business liability and benefit paid under employee disability program our self insurance accrual are primarily based on estimated cost determined by actuarial method estimated cost include consideration of variety of factor and related assumption such the severity of claim frequency and volume of claim healthcare inflation seasonality and plan design which may be subject to high degree of variability however the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claim involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known which may be several year material increase in the magnitude of claim change to healthcare cost accident frequency and severity insurance retention level judgment and settlement amount associated legal expense and other factor could result in unfavorable difference between actual self insurance cost and our reserve estimate result our insurance and claim cost could continue to increase materially which could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition during higher self insurance accrual negatively impacted our result of operation see item management discussion and analysis of result of operation and financial condition of this annual report for more information supplement to our self insurance program we maintain coverage with excess insurance carrier for potential loss that exceed the amount we self insure periodically we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance level based on risk tolerance risk volatility and premium expense although we believe our aggregate insurance limit should be sufficient to cover our historic claim amount the commercial trucking industry ha experienced wave of blockbuster or so called nuclear verdict including some instance in which jury have awarded hundred of million of dollar to those injured in accident and their family such the recently affirmed award by new mexico state court jury in personal injury and wrongful death lawsuit against fedex ground discussed below given this recent trend it is possible that additional claim could exceed our aggregate coverage limit if any other claim were to exceed our aggregate insurance coverage we would bear the excess in addition to our other self insured amount given the current claim environment the amount of coverage available from excess insurance carrier is decreasing the premium for this excess coverage are increasing significantly and excess insurance carrier are challenging insurance claim more frequently accordingly our excess insurance and claim expense may continue to increase or we could further increase our self insured retention policy are renewed or replaced in jury awarded compensatory damage of approximately million to plaintiff in connection with personal injury and wrongful death lawsuit filed against fedex ground in new mexico state court the award wa subsequently affirmed by the new mexico court of appeal and ultimately by the new mexico supreme court in may while our insurance carrier have funded the approximately million base judgment in excess of fedex ground million self insured retention and insurance deductible we are currently pursuing insurance coverage for reimbursement of approximately million of pre and post judgment interest see note of the consolidated financial statement included in item financial statement and supplementary data of this annual report for more information our result of operation and financial condition could continue to be adversely affected if our cost or loss significantly exceed our aggregate coverage limit we are unable to obtain excess insurance coverage in amount we deem sufficient our insurance carrier fail to pay on our insurance claim or we experience claim for which coverage is not provided the transportation infrastructure continues to be target of terrorist activity because transportation asset continue to be target of terrorist activity government around the world are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirement that will increase operating cost and potentially slow service for business including those in the transportation industry these security requirement are not static but change periodically the result of regulatory and legislative requirement imposing additional security cost and creating level of uncertainty for our operation for example the tsa requires fedex express to comply with full all cargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains evolving and strict security requirement additionally the icao standard that previously allowed member state to permit carrier and other entity to determine without government oversight which shipper and shipment are secure for purpose of putting those shipment on all cargo aircraft wa modified effective july result we are now required to undertake additional security measure for international outbound shipment it is reasonably possible that these rule or other future security requirement could impose material cost on or slow our service to our customer the impact on our operation of avoiding area of the world including airspace in which there are geopolitical conflict and the targeting of aircraft by party to those conflict can also be significant moreover terrorist attack directed at fedex or other aspect of the transportation infrastructure could disrupt our operation and adversely impact demand for our service strategic risk failure to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to change in market dynamic and customer preference will cause our future financial result to suffer we are making significant investment and other decision in connection with our long term business strategy such investment in fleet and facility modernization and strategic investment to increase collaboration and automation and improve productivity network efficiency and safety additionally we are executing initiative to use data to transform the digital and physical experience of our customer and team member well to transform and optimize the fedex express international business particularly in europe see item business and item management discussion and analysis of result of operation and financial condition of this annual report for additional information such initiative and enhancement may require to make significant capital expenditure or incur significant expense we have also incurred and may continue to incur increased operating expense in connection with certain change to our business strategy we may not be able to derive the expected operational efficiency cost saving and other benefit from our strategic investment and other decision for example in we announced workforce reduction plan in europe the execution of the plan is subject to work council consultation process that will occur through in accordance with local country process and regulation the actual amount and timing of business realignment cost and related cost saving resulting from the workforce reduction plan are dependent on local country consultation process and regulation and negotiated social plan and may differ from our current expectation and estimate if we are not able to successfully implement this plan our future financial result may suffer change in our business strategy may also expose to new and heightened risk for example shoprunner which we acquired in collect and store certain personal data of it merchant and their buyer it partner consumer with whom it ha direct relationship and user of it application additionally it us third party service provider and subprocessors to help deliver service to merchant and their buyer these service provider and subprocessors may store or access personal data including payment information and or other confidential information the foregoing factor increase the risk of data incident and the amount of potential exposure in the event of data breach developing privacy legislation within the may also create limitation or added requirement on the use of personal data within and among fedex dataworks shoprunner and the other fedex operating company further in developing our business strategy we make certain assumption including but not limited to those related to customer demand and the mix of service to be purchased by our customer the future rate of commerce growth and the timeline for recovery of passenger airline cargo capacity competition and the global economy and actual market economic and other condition may be different from our assumption technology customer behavior and market condition continue to evolve it is important that we maintain the relevance of our brand and service offering to our customer if we are not able to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to change in market dynamic and customer preference our future financial result will suffer for additional discussion see item business of this annual report under the caption strategy we may not be able to achieve our fiscal financial performance goal in june we announced that fedex is targeting certain financial performance goal for fiscal our ability to achieve these goal is dependent on number of factor including the other risk factor described in this section if we are not able to achieve these goal the price of our common stock may be negatively affected we depend on our strong reputation and the value of the fedex brand the fedex brand name symbolizes high quality service reliability and speed fedex is one of the most widely recognized trusted and respected brand in the world and the fedex brand is one of our most important and valuable asset in addition we have strong reputation among customer team member and the general public for high standard of social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance and ethic the fedex brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sale and marketing and recruitment tool and we devote significant resource to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activity by our team member or others with whom we do business such customer service mishap accident catastrophe or incident involving aircraft vehicle or facility operated by low service or safety level data breach or technology infrastructure disruption noncompliance with law the shipment of certain item pursuant to our obligation common carrier operating under federal law our advertising campaign sponsorship arrangement or marketing program or our executive compensation practice could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand with the increase in the use of social medium outlet such facebook youtube instagram twitter and tiktok adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly without context making it increasingly difficult for to effectively respond further our actual or perceived position or lack of position on social environmental political public policy or other sensitive issue and any perceived lack of transparency about those matter could harm our reputation with certain group including our customer and team member damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our service and or create difficulty in retaining and recruiting employee talent and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and result of operation well require additional resource to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand change in the business or financial soundness of the usps including strategic change to it operation to reduce it reliance on the air network of fedex express could have an adverse effect on our result of operation and financial condition the usps is the largest customer of fedex express which provides domestic air transportation service for the usps first class mail priority mail express and priority mail and transportation and delivery for the usps international delivery service see item business of this annual report under fedex express segment for more information the covid pandemic ha negatively impacted the usps additionally the usps continues to experience budgetary uncertainty well increased political debate regarding potential privatization or restructuring of it operation the usps is currently implementing strategic change to it operation to reduce it reliance on the air network of fedex express and other transportation provider which negatively impacted our result of operation in the difficulty discussed above or additional change in the usps business including it ability to access capital or any structural change to it operation network volume level service offering service commitment or pricing could have additional negative impact on our revenue result of operation and financial condition further decision by the usps to terminate early or not renew it contract with fedex express for domestic service which expires in september would negatively impact our profitability we face intense competition the transportation and business service market are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service especially in period of little or no macroeconomic growth some of our competitor have more financial resource and competitive advantage than we do appear willing to operate at little or no margin to gain market share or they are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign government which enables them to raise capital more easily we also compete with regional transportation provider that operate smaller and le capital intensive transportation network and startup company that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market need in addition some high volume package shipper are developing and implementing in house delivery capability and utilizing independent contractor for delivery which could in turn reduce our revenue and market share for example amazon com ha established network of hub aircraft and vehicle and ha expressed an intention to offer it internal delivery capability broadly to third party see item business of this annual report for additional information we believe we compete effectively with these company for example by providing more reliable service at compensatory price however the existence of an irrational pricing environment could limit our ability not only to maintain or increase our price including our fuel surcharge in response to rising fuel cost but also to maintain or grow our revenue and market share while we believe we compete effectively through our current and planned service offering if our current competitor or potential future competitor offer broader range of service or better service level more effectively bundle their service or offer service at lower price it could impede our ability to maintain or grow our market share continued transportation industry consolidation may further increase competition moreover if high volume package shipper further develop or expand internal capability for the service we provide it may reduce our revenue and could negatively impact our financial condition and result of operation these impact could be exacerbated if high volume package shipper offer such capability to third party news regarding such development or expansion could also negatively impact the price of our common stock additionally advancement in technology such advanced safety system automated package sorting handling and delivery autonomous delivery third party supply chain insight and management vehicle platooning alternative fuel vehicle and digitization of freight service may necessitate that we increase investment in order to remain competitive and our customer may not be willing to accept higher rate to cover the cost of these investment our business are capital intensive and we must make capital decision based upon projected volume level we make significant investment in aircraft package handling facility vehicle technology sort equipment and other asset to support our transportation and business network we also make significant investment to rebrand integrate and grow the company that we acquire the amount and timing of capital investment depend on various factor including our anticipated volume growth we must make commitment to purchase or modify aircraft year before the aircraft are actually needed we must predict volume level and fleet requirement and make commitment for aircraft based on those projection missing our projection could result in much or too little capacity relative to our shipping volume overcapacity could lead to below market asset disposition or write down well negatively impact operating margin and undercapacity could negatively impact service level our inability to execute and effectively operate integrate leverage and grow acquired business and realize the anticipated benefit of acquisition joint venture and strategic alliance and investment could materially adversely affect our strategy for long term growth productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to make prudent strategic acquisition and investment form joint venture or strategic alliance and realize the expected benefit from these transaction we regularly acquire business enter into strategic alliance and make investment across the more than country and territory in which we provide service acquisition and other strategic transaction involve special commercial customer accounting regulatory compliance information technology human resource cultural and other risk including the potential assumption of unanticipated liability and contingency additionally we may be required to make significant capital expenditure and or incur certain operating expense following the completion of certain transaction which may be higher than initially expected for example existing and future customer data in the system and business of fedex and shoprunner may not be immediately interoperable or may not be interoperable without significant added expense in addition we are currently in the process of migrating customer from service offered by tnt express to the fedex express portfolio of service while we expect our past and future acquisition and strategic transaction to enhance our value proposition to customer and improve our business and long term profitability there can be no assurance that we will realize our expectation within the time frame we have established if at all or that we can continue to support the value we allocate to acquired business including their goodwill or other intangible asset we have previously incurred goodwill impairment charge related to certain of our acquisition some of which have been material and may incur additional goodwill impairment charge in the future our autonomous delivery strategy is dependent upon our ability to successfully mitigate unique technological operational and regulatory risk discussed further in item business under fedex service segment customer driven technology autonomous delivery technology we are exploring the use of autonomous delivery technology within our operation autonomous delivery is new and evolving market which make it difficult to predict it acceptance growth the magnitude and timing of necessary investment and other trend this aspect of our business strategy is subject to variety of risk inherent with the development of new technology including the ability to continue to develop autonomous delivery software and hardware access to sufficient capital our ability to develop and maintain necessary partnership risk related to the manufacture of autonomous device and significant competition from other company some of which may have more resource and capital to devote to autonomous delivery technology than we do in addition we face risk related to the commercial deployment of autonomous delivery device on our targeted timeline or at all including consumer acceptance achievement of adequate safety and other performance standard and compliance with uncertain evolving and potentially conflicting federal and state regulation to the extent accident cybersecurity breach or other adverse event associated with our autonomous delivery device occur we could be subject to liability government scrutiny further regulation and reputational damage any of the foregoing could adversely impact our result of operation financial condition and growth prospect human resource management risk our failure to attract and retain employee talent or maintain our company culture well increase in labor and purchased transportation cost could adversely impact our business and result of operation our success depends upon the effort and ability of our high quality employee many of whom are longstanding fedex team member difficulty in motivating rewarding recruiting and retaining employee talent including successor to member of senior management the unexpected loss of such individual resulting in the depletion of our institutional knowledge base and or our inability to successfully transition key role could have an adverse impact on our business result of operation reputation and the price of our common stock certain position at fedex have historically experienced high turnover rate which can lead to increased recruiting training and retention cost additionally our company culture is important to providing high quality customer service and having productive workforce and could be adversely affected by our growing operation and other factor if we fail to maintain the strength of our company culture our competitive ability and our business may be harmed our business is labor intensive in nature and our ability to meet our labor and purchased transportation need while controlling related cost is generally subject to numerous external factor including the availability of qualified person in the market where we and our contracted service provider operate and unemployment level within these market prevailing wage rate and other benefit health and other insurance cost inflation behavioral change adoption of new or revised employment and labor law and regulation including increased minimum wage requirement or government program safety level of our operation our reputation within the labor market the continuing effect of the covid pandemic and variant strain the availability of child care and vaccine mandate that may be announced in jurisdiction in which our business operate labor market challenge contributed to global supply chain disruption and affected the availability and cost of labor resulting in network inefficiency higher purchased transportation cost and higher wage rate in we expect such condition to continue to be present in see item management discussion and analysis of result of operation and financial condition of this annual report for more information our inability to effectively meet our labor and purchased transportation need can hinder our ability to execute our business strategy negatively impact service level and adversely affect our business and result of operation labor organization attempt to organize group of our employee from time to time and potential change in labor law could make it easier for them to do so if we are unable to continue to maintain good relationship with our employee and avoid having labor organization organize group of our employee our operating cost could significantly increase and our operational flexibility could be significantly reduced despite continual organizing attempt by labor union other than the pilot at fedex express and driver at one fedex freight inc facility our employee have thus far chosen not to unionize we acquired fedex supply chain in which already had small number of employee who are member of union additionally certain of fedex express non employee are unionized in june the transport worker union filed an application with the national mediation board requesting an election to represent approximately goc specialist who perform flight dispatching function in fedex express goc center fedex express ha raised objection to the application in it response in labor union attempted to organize employee at business and in industry that have not traditionally been unionized and in certain instance were successful such attempt could continue in our collective bargaining agreement with the alpa which represents the pilot of fedex express became amendable in november bargaining for successor agreement began in may and continues while collective bargaining agreement under the rla which cover the pilot at fedex express do not expire we may be unable to maintain certain favorable term included in the current collective bargaining agreement following negotiation with the alpa our inability to successfully reach new collective bargaining agreement with the alpa and other union representing fedex employee could adversely affect our business and result of operation the congress ha in the past considered adopting change in labor law that would make it easier for union to organize unit of our employee for example there is always possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employee from the jurisdiction of the rla for additional discussion of the rla see item business of this annual report under the caption regulation such legislation could expose our customer to the type of service disruption that the rla wa designed to prevent local work stoppage in key area that interrupt the timely flow of shipment of time sensitive high value good throughout our global network such disruption could threaten our ability to provide competitively priced shipping option and ready access to global market there is also the possibility that congress could pas other labor legislation that could adversely affect our company such fedex ground and fedex freight whose employee are governed by the nlra in addition federal and state governmental agency such the national mediation board and the nlrb have and may continue to take action that could make it easier for our employee well our vendor and supplier workforce to organize under the rla or nlra finally change to federal or state law regulation rule judicial or administrative precedent or guidance governing employee classification could impact the status of fedex ground service provider independent employer of driver if fedex ground is deemed to be an employer or joint employer of the driver of these service provider labor organization could more easily organize these individual our operating cost could increase materially and we could incur significant capital outlay and experience adverse impact to service level fedex ground contract with service provider to conduct it linehaul and pickup and delivery operation and the status of these service provider direct and exclusive employer of driver providing these service is being challenged we are defending joint employer case where it is alleged that fedex ground should be treated an employer or joint employer of the driver employed by service provider engaged by fedex ground we incur certain cost including legal fee in defending the status of service provider engaged by fedex ground direct employer of their driver we continue to believe that fedex ground is not an employer or joint employer of the driver of these independent business however adverse determination in these matter or regulatory development could among other thing entitle service provider driver to certain wage payment and penalty from the service provider and fedex ground and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for fedex ground proposed pilot flight and duty time regulation could impair our operation and impose substantial cost on in the faa proposed regulation that would change the flight and duty time rule applicable to all cargo air carrier when the faa issued final regulation in the regulation all cargo carrier including fedex express were exempt from these new requirement instead all cargo carrier were required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rule and allowed to pursue the development of fatigue risk management system to develop fatigue mitigation unique to each operation in the faa reaffirmed the exclusion of all cargo carrier from the regulation and litigation in the court of appeal for the district of columbia affirmed the faa decision however this issue remains policy priority for certain labor group and the congress is currently considering legislation that if adopted would require all cargo carrier to comply with the regulation required compliance with the regulation would make it more difficult to avoid pilot fatigue and could impose substantial cost on in order to maintain operational reliability increasing cost the volatility of cost and funding requirement and other legal mandate for employee benefit especially pension and healthcare benefit could adversely impact our result of operation financial condition and liquidity we sponsor program that provide retirement benefit to most of our employee these program include defined benefit pension plan defined contribution plan and postretirement healthcare plan the cost of providing pension and other retirement benefit plan are dependent on numerous assumption such discount rate investment return on plan asset salary increase expected retirement mortality employee turnover and future increase in healthcare cost change in actuarial assumption and difference between the assumption and actual value well significant decline in the value of investment that fund our pension and other postretirement plan if not offset or mitigated by decline in plan liability could increase pension and other postretirement expense and we could be required from time to time to fund the pension plan with significant amount of cash such cash funding obligation could adversely affect our result of operation and liquidity additionally the rule for pension and retirement benefit plan accounting are complex involve numerous assumption and can produce volatility in our result of operation financial condition and liquidity for example our fourth quarter mark to market mtm retirement plan accounting adjustment resulted in pre tax noncash loss of billion in billion net of tax or per diluted share and gain of billion in million net of tax or per diluted share for additional information on our mtm retirement plan accounting adjustment see item management discussion and analysis of result of operation and financial condition result of operation and outlook consolidated result retirement plan mtm adjustment and note of the consolidated financial statement included in item financial statement and supplementary data of this annual report environmental climate and weather risk we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market response to such change concern over climate change including the impact of global warming ha led to significant and international legislative and regulatory effort to limit ghg emission including our aircraft and vehicle engine emission increasingly state and local government are also considering ghg regulatory requirement compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various country and region are following different approach to the regulation of climate change increased regulation regarding ghg emission especially aircraft or vehicle engine emission could impose substantial cost on especially at fedex express these cost include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital cost associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicle prematurely until the timing scope and extent of such possible regulation becomes known we can not predict it effect on our cost structure or our operating result it is reasonably possible however that it could materially increase our operating expense and have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business if instituted for additional discussion of regulatory response to climate change including corsia and the paris climate accord see item business of this annual report under the caption regulation we may also incur additional expense result of and international regulator requiring additional disclosure regarding ghg emission moreover even without such regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by company in the airline and transportation industry could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our service especially our air express service finally given the broad and global scope of our operation and our susceptibility to global macroeconomic trend we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risk of climate change that could affect all of humankind such shift in weather pattern and world ecosystem we may be unable to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operation by calendar in we announced goal to achieve carbon neutrality for our global operation by calendar achievement of this goal depends on our execution of operational strategy relating to vehicle electrification development of sustainable customer solution identification and investment in alternative fuel fuel conservation and aircraft modernization program and investment in our facility and natural carbon sequestration execution of these strategy and achievement of our calendar goal is subject to risk and uncertainty many of which are outside of our control these risk and uncertainty include but are not limited to our ability to successfully implement our business strategy effectively respond to change in market dynamic and achieve the anticipated benefit and associated cost saving of such strategy and action the availability and cost and our ability to acquire alternative fuel vehicle alternative fuel fuel efficient aircraft global electrical charging infrastructure off site renewable energy and other material and component unforeseen production design operational and technological difficulty the outcome of research effort and future technology development including the ability to scale project and technology on commercially competitive basis such carbon sequestration and or other related process compliance with and change or addition to global and regional regulation tax charge mandate or requirement relating to ghg emission carbon cost or climate related goal labor related regulation and requirement that restrict or prohibit our ability to impose requirement on third party who provide contracted transportation for our transportation network adapting product to customer preference and customer acceptance of sustainable supply chain solution and the action of competitor and competitive pressure there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our strategy and achieve our calendar goal of carbon neutrality for our global operation failure to achieve our calendar goal could damage our reputation and customer and other stakeholder relationship further given investor increased focus related to environmental social and governance matter such failure could cause large stockholder to reduce their ownership of fedex common stock and limit our access to financing such condition could have an adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition well on the price of our common stock our inability to quickly and effectively restore operation following adverse weather or localized disaster or disturbance in key geography could adversely impact our business and result of operation while we operate several integrated network with asset distributed throughout the world there are concentration of key asset within our network that are exposed to adverse weather condition or localized risk from natural or manmade disaster such earthquake volcano wildfire hurricane tornado flood severe winter weather conflict or unrest terrorist attack or other disturbance actual or threatened additionally shift in weather pattern caused by climate change could increase the frequency severity or duration of

fuel surcharge while fluctuation in fuel surcharge percentage can be significant from period to period fuel surcharge represent one of the many individual component of our pricing structure that

in and million in includes cost associated with the workforce reduction plan in europe includes million charge in related to pre and post judgment interest in connection with fedex ground legal matter the challenging labor market and inflationary pressure contributed to increase in purchased transportation salary and employee benefit and other operating expense in higher fuel surcharge also contributed to increased purchased transportation cost salary and employee benefit expense also increased in due to merit increase partially offset by lower variable incentive compensation expense higher self insurance accrual increased cost related to information technology expense charge related to pre and post judgment interest in connection with fedex ground legal matter and additional volume related expense also contributed to an increase in other operating expense in rental and landing fee increased in primarily driven by increased vehicle and aircraft lease at fedex express well network expansion at fedex ground fuel we apply fuel surcharge on our air and ground service most of which are adjusted on weekly basis the fuel surcharge is based on weekly fuel price from two week prior to the week in which it is assessed some fedex express international fuel surcharge incorporate timing lag of approximately six to eight week we routinely review our fuel surcharge and periodically update the table used to determine our fuel surcharge at all of our transportation segment the net impact of fuel on operating income described below and for each segment below doe not include the impact from these ordinary course table change while fluctuation in fuel surcharge percentage can be significant from period to period fuel surcharge represent one of the many individual component of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield additional component include the mix of service sold the base price and extra service charge we obtain for these service and level of pricing discount offered in order to provide information about the impact of fuel surcharge on the trend in revenue and yield growth we have included the comparative weighted average fuel surcharge percentage in effect for and in the accompanying discussion of each of our transportation segment fuel expense increased during due to higher fuel price in addition to variability in usage and market price the manner in which we purchase fuel also influence the net impact of fuel on our result for example our contract for jet fuel purchase at fedex express are tied to various index including the gulf coast index while many of these index are aligned each index may fluctuate at different pace driving variability in the price paid for jet fuel furthermore under these contractual arrangement approximately of our jet fuel is purchased based on the index price for the preceding week with the remainder of our purchase tied primarily to the index price for the preceding month and preceding day rather than based on daily spot rate these contractual provision mitigate the impact of rapidly changing daily spot rate on our jet fuel purchase because of the factor described above our operating result may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by significant amount or change by amount that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharge which can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short term for more information see item risk factor the net impact of fuel had significant benefit to operating income in higher fuel surcharge outpaced increased fuel price the net impact of fuel on our operating result doe not consider the effect that fuel surcharge level may have on our business including change in demand and shift in the mix of service purchased by our customer in addition our purchased transportation expense is impacted by fuel cost other income and expense interest expense decreased million in primarily due to the debt extinguishment transaction further discussed in the liquidity section of this md and note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement during we issued billion of senior unsecured debt under our shelf registration statement and used the net proceeds to redeem outstanding debt in connection with our debt restructuring we recognized loss on debt extinguishment of million million net of tax or per diluted share in see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement for more information retirement plan mtm adjustment in we incurred pre tax noncash mtm loss of billion billion net of tax or per diluted share which includes net loss of billion billion net of tax or per diluted share related to the year end actuarial adjustment of pension and postretirement healthcare plan asset and liability these actuarial adjustment were due to lower than expected asset return demographic experience and an update to the mortality assumption partially

tax for global intangible low taxed income period cost our income tax position are based on currently enacted tax law further guidance is issued by the treasury department the irs and other standard setting body any resulting change to our estimate will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance for more information see the income tax section of this md and note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement self insurance accrual our self insurance reserve are established for estimate of ultimate loss on all incurred claim including incurred but not reported claim component of our self insurance reserve included in this critical accounting estimate are worker compensation claim vehicle accident property and cargo loss general business liability and benefit paid under employee disability program these reserve are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claim incurred of the balance sheet date these estimate include judgment about severity of claim frequency and volume of claim healthcare inflation seasonality and plan design the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claim involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known which may be several year we believe our recorded obligation for these expense are consistently measured on conservative basis nevertheless change in accident frequency and severity healthcare cost insurance retention level and other factor can materially affect the estimate for these liability and affect our result of operation self insurance accrual reflected in our balance sheet for the period ended may are follows in million short term long term total five percent reduction or improvement in the assumed claim severity used to estimate our self insurance accrual would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million in our reserve and expense of and for the year ended may long lived asset useful life and salvage value our business is capital intensive with approximately of our owned asset invested in our transportation and information system infrastructure the depreciation or amortization of our capital asset over their estimated useful life and the determination of any salvage value requires management to make judgment about future event because we utilize many of our capital asset over relatively long period the majority of aircraft cost are depreciated over to year we periodically evaluate whether adjustment to our estimated service life or salvage value are necessary to ensure these estimate properly match the economic use of the asset these evaluation consider usage maintenance cost and economic factor that affect the useful life of an asset this evaluation may result in change in the estimated life and residual value used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment for our aircraft we consider actual experience with the same or similar aircraft type and future volume projection in estimating the useful life and expected salvage value we typically assign no residual value due to the utilization of our aircraft in cargo configuration which result in little to no value at the end of their useful life these estimate affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in period and ultimately the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset change in the estimated life of asset will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future period and could have material impact on our result of operation described below historically gain and loss on disposal of operating equipment have not been material however such amount may differ materially in the future due to change in business level technological obsolescence accident frequency regulatory change and other factor beyond our control impairment of may the fedex express global air network included fleet of aircraft including approximately supplemental aircraft that provide delivery of package and freight to more than country and territory through wide range of and international shipping service while certain aircraft are utilized in primary geographic area versus international we operate an integrated global network and utilize our aircraft and other mode of transportation to achieve the lowest cost of delivery while maintaining our service commitment to our customer because of the integrated nature of our global network our aircraft are interchangeable across route and geography giving flexibility with our fleet planning to meet changing global economic condition and maintain and modify aircraft needed because of the lengthy lead time for aircraft manufacture and modification we must anticipate volume level and plan our fleet requirement year in advance and make commitment for aircraft based on those projection furthermore the timing and availability of certain used aircraft type particularly those with better fuel efficiency may create limited opportunity to acquire these aircraft at favorable price in advance of our capacity need these activity create risk that asset capacity may exceed demand at may we had two purchased aircraft that were not yet placed into service we evaluate our long lived asset used in operation for impairment when event and circumstance indicate that the undiscounted cash flow to be generated by that asset group are le than the carrying amount of the asset group and may not be recoverable if the cash flow do not exceed the carrying value the asset must be adjusted to it current fair value we operate integrated transportation network and accordingly cash flow for most of our operating asset are assessed at network level not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment further decision about capital investment are evaluated based on the impact to the overall network rather than the return on an individual asset we make decision to remove certain long lived asset from service based on projection of reduced capacity need or lower operating cost of newer aircraft type and those decision may result in an impairment charge asset held for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair value le cost to sell when the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criterion are met the fair value determination for such aircraft may require management estimate there may not be active market for some of these aircraft such estimate are subject to revision from period to period in the normal management of our aircraft fleet we routinely idle aircraft and engine temporarily due to maintenance cycle and adjustment of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand level temporarily idled asset are classified available for use and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these asset these temporarily idled asset are assessed for impairment and remaining life on quarterly basis the criterion for determining whether an asset ha been permanently removed from service and result is potentially impaired include but are not limited to our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume level including capacity need during our peak shipping season the introduction of new fleet type or decision to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operation and change to planned service expansion activity at may we had eight aircraft temporarily idled these aircraft have been idled for an average of month and are expected to return to revenue service in order to meet expected demand lease we utilize operating lease to finance certain of our aircraft facility and equipment such arrangement typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the asset at the end of the lease period to the lessor in accordance with the new lease accounting standard adopted in we had approximately billion in operating lease liability and related right of use asset on the balance sheet of may the weighted average remaining lease term of all operating lease outstanding at may wa approximately year our lease generally contain option to extend or terminate the lease we reevaluate our lease on regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentive of exercising the renewal option and how they align with our operating strategy therefore substantially all the renewal option period are not included within the lease term and the associated payment are not included in the measurement of the right of use asset and lease liability the option to extend are not reasonably certain at lease commencement short term lease with an initial term of month or le are not recognized in the right to use asset and lease liability on the consolidated balance sheet the lease liability are measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the minimum lease payment not yet paid and our incremental borrowing rate which approximates the rate at which we would borrow on collateralized basis over the term of lease in the applicable currency environment the interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not determinable in transaction where we are the lessee the determination of whether lease is accounted for finance lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimate primarily about the fair value of the asset and it estimated economic useful life in addition our evaluation includes ensuring we properly account for build to suit lease arrangement and making judgment about whether various form of lessee involvement during the construction period allow the lessee to control the underlying leased asset during the construction period we believe we have well defined and controlled process for making these evaluation including obtaining third party appraisal for material transaction to assist in making these evaluation goodwill we had billion of recorded goodwill at may and billion of recorded goodwill at may from our business acquisition representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net asset acquired several factor give rise to goodwill in our acquisition such the expected benefit from synergy of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment in our evaluation of goodwill impairment we perform qualitative assessment that requires management judgment and the use of estimate to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount an entity ha an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test an entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period we performed both qualitative and quantitative assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of and this included comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying value including attributable goodwill fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodology principally the income or market approach classified level within the fair value hierarchy incorporating market participant consideration and management assumption on revenue growth rate operating margin discount rate and expected capital expenditure estimate used by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test change in forecasted operating result and other assumption could materially affect these estimate part of our qualitative assessment we consider change in the macroeconomic environment such the general economic condition limitation on accessing capital fluctuation in foreign exchange rate and other development in equity and credit market the market approach us observable market data of comparable public company to estimate fair value utilizing financial metric such operating value to earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization we apply judgment to select appropriate comparison company based on the business operation growth size and risk profile relative to our reporting unit change to our selection of comparable company may result in change to the estimate of fair value of our reporting unit our reporting unit with significant recorded goodwill include fedex express fedex ground and fedex freight we evaluated these reporting unit during the fourth quarter of and and the estimated fair value of each of these reporting unit exceeded their carrying value of the end of and therefore we do not believe that any of these reporting unit were impaired of the balance sheet date legal and other contingency we are subject to various loss contingency in connection with our operation contingent liability are difficult to measure their measurement is subject to multiple factor that are not easily predicted or projected further additional complexity in measuring these liability arises due to the various jurisdiction in which these matter occur which make our ability to predict their outcome highly uncertain moreover different accounting rule must be employed to account for these item based on the nature of the contingency accordingly significant management judgment is required to ass these matter and to make determination about the measurement of liability if any certain pending loss contingency are described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement in the opinion of management the aggregate liability if any of individual matter or group of related matter not specifically described in note is not expected to be material to our financial position result of operation or cash flow the following describes our method and associated process for evaluating these matter because of the complex environment in which we operate we are subject to numerous legal proceeding and claim including those relating to general commercial matter governmental enforcement action employment related claim and fedex ground service provider accounting guidance for contingency requires an accrual of estimated loss from contingency such non income tax or other legal proceeding or claim when it is probable the future event or event are likely to occur that loss ha been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated this guidance also requires disclosure of loss contingency matter when in management judgment material loss is reasonably possible or probable during the preparation of our financial statement we evaluate our contingency to determine whether it is probable reasonably possible or remote that liability ha been incurred loss is recognized for all contingency deemed probable and estimable regardless of amount for unresolved contingency with potentially material exposure that are deemed reasonably possible we evaluate whether potential loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated our evaluation of these matter is the result of comprehensive process designed to ensure that accounting recognition of loss or disclosure of these contingency is made in timely manner and involves our legal and accounting personnel well external counsel where applicable the process includes regular communication during each quarter and scheduled meeting shortly before the completion of our financial statement to evaluate any new legal proceeding and the status of existing matter in determining whether loss should be accrued or loss contingency disclosed we evaluate among other factor the current status of each matter within the scope and context of the entire lawsuit or proceeding the lengthy and complex nature of class action matter the procedural status of each matter any opportunity to dispose of lawsuit on it merit before trial motion to dismiss or for summary judgment the amount of time remaining before trial date the status of discovery the status of settlement arbitration or mediation proceeding and our judgment regarding the likelihood of success prior to or at trial in reaching our conclusion with respect to accrual of loss or loss contingency disclosure we take holistic view of each matter based on these factor and the information available prior to the issuance of our financial statement uncertainty with respect to an individual factor or combination of these factor may impact our decision related to accrual or disclosure of loss contingency including conclusion that we are unable to establish an estimate of possible loss or meaningful range of possible loss we update our disclosure to reflect our most current understanding of the contingency at the time we issue our financial statement however event may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of contingency may result in loss to that differs materially from our previously estimated liability or range of possible loss despite the inherent complexity in the accounting and disclosure of contingency we believe that our process are robust and thorough and provide consistent framework for management in evaluating the potential outcome of contingency for proper accounting recognition and disclosure item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate while we currently have market risk sensitive instrument related to interest rate we do not have significant exposure to changing interest rate on our long term debt disclosed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statement we had outstanding fixed rate long term debt exclusive of finance lease with an estimated fair value of billion at may and outstanding fixed and floating rate long term debt exclusive of finance lease with an estimated fair value of billion at may market risk for long term debt is estimated the potential decrease in fair value resulting from hypothetical increase in interest rate and amount to approximately million of may and approximately million of may the underlying fair value of our long term debt were estimated based on quoted market price or on the current rate offered for debt with similar term and maturity we have interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligation change in interest rate impact our liability associated with these retirement plan well the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized decline in the value of plan asset could diminish the funded status of our pension plan and potentially increase our requirement to make contribution to the plan substantial investment loss on plan asset would also increase net pension expense see the critical accounting estimate retirement plan section of item management discussion and analysis of result of operation and financial condition of this annual report for more information foreign currency while we are global provider of transportation commerce and business service the majority of our transaction during the period presented in this annual report are denominated in dollar the principal foreign currency exchange rate risk to which we are exposed are in the euro chinese yuan british pound canadian dollar hong kong dollar australian dollar japanese yen and mexican peso historically our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation is more significant with respect to our revenue than our expense significant portion of our expense are denominated in dollar such aircraft and fuel expense foreign currency fluctuation had slightly positive impact on operating income in and slightly negative impact on operating income in however favorable foreign currency fluctuation also may have had an offsetting impact on the price we obtained or the demand for our service which is not quantifiable at may the result of uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currency in which our transaction are denominated would result in decrease in expected operating income of approximately million for this theoretical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the dollar which is not consistent with our actual experience in foreign currency transaction in addition to the direct effect of change in exchange rate fluctuation in exchange rate also affect the volume of sale or the foreign currency sale price competitor service become more or le attractive the sensitivity analysis of the effect of change in foreign currency exchange rate doe not factor in potential change in sale level or local currency price we maintain derivative financial instrument to manage foreign currency fluctuation related to probable future transaction and cash flow denominated in currency other than the currency of the transacting entity which impact our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk these derivative are not designated hedge and are accounted for at fair value with any profit or loss recorded in income which wa immaterial for and commodity while we have market risk for change in the price of jet and vehicle fuel this risk is largely mitigated by our indexed fuel surcharge for

benefit pension plan that provide retirement benefit to certain employee the company projected benefit obligation for the pension plan is measured using actuarial technique that reflect management assumption for discount rate future salary increase employee turnover mortality and retirement age auditing the projected benefit obligation of the pension plan wa complex due to the highly judgmental nature and significant effect of the discount rate used in the measurement process the discount rate is developed by utilizing the yield on theoretical portfolio of high grade corporate bond that match cash flow to benefit payment limit the concentration by industry and issuer and apply screening criterion to exclude bond with call feature unless they have low probability of being called how we addressed the matter in our audit we obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of control over management process for estimating the projected benefit

fedex and it subsidiary substantially all of which are wholly owned all significant intercompany account and transaction have been eliminated in consolidation revenue recognition satisfaction of performance obligationa performance obligation is promise in contract to transfer distinct good or service to the customer and is the basis of revenue recognition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle gaap to determine the proper revenue recognition method for contract we evaluate whether two or more contract should be combined and accounted for one single contract and whether the combined or single contract should be accounted for more than one performance obligation for most of our contract the customer contract with to provide distinct service within single contract primarily transportation service substantially all of our contract with customer for transportation service include only one performance obligation the transportation service however if contract is separated into more than one performance obligation we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling price of the promised good or service underlying each performance obligation we frequently sell standard transportation service with observable standalone sale price in these instance the observable standalone sale are used to determine the standalone selling price for transportation service revenue is recognized over time we perform the service in the contract because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer our customer receive the benefit of our service the good are transported from one location to another if we were unable to complete delivery to the final location another entity would not need to reperform the transportation service already performed control transfer over time revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the product or service to be provided we use the cost to cost measure of progress for our package delivery contract because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs we incur cost on our contract under the cost to cost measure of progress the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of cost incurred to date to the total estimated cost at completion of the performance obligation revenue including ancillary or accessorial fee and reduction for estimated customer incentive is recorded proportionally cost are incurred cost to fulfill include labor and other direct cost and an allocation of indirect cost for our fedex freight and freight forwarding contract an output method of progress based on time in transit is utilized the timing of cost incurred doe not best depict the transfer of control to the customer we also provide customized customer specific solution such supply chain management solution and inventory and service part logistics through which we provide the service of integrating complex set of task and component into single capability for these arrangement the majority of which are conducted by our fedex logistics inc fedex logistics operating segment the entire contract is accounted for one performance obligation for these performance obligation we typically have right to consideration from customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance completed to date and such we recognize revenue in the amount to which we have right to invoice the customer fedex corporationnotes to consolidated financial statement contract modificationcontracts are often modified to account for change in the rate we charge our customer or to add additional distinct service we consider contract modification to exist when the modification either creates new enforceable right and obligation or alters the existing arrangement contract modification that add distinct good or service are treated separate contract contract modification that do not add distinct good or service typically change the price of existing service these contract modification are accounted for prospectively the remaining performance obligation are distinct variable considerationcertain contract contain customer incentive guaranteed service refund and other provision that can either increase or decrease the transaction price these incentive are generally awarded based upon achieving certain performance metric we estimate variable consideration the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled we include estimated amount of revenue which may be reduced by incentive or other contract provision in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved our estimate of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amount in the transaction price are based on an assessment of anticipated customer spending and all information historical current and forecasted that is reasonably available to principal agent considerationstransportation service are provided with the use of employee and independent business that contract with fedex gaap requires to evaluate whether our business themselves promise to transfer service to the customer the principal or to arrange for service to be provided by another party the agent using control model based on our evaluation of the control model we determined that fedex is the principal to the transaction for most of these service and revenue is recognized on gross basis based on the transfer of control to the customer cost associated with independent business providing transportation service are recognized incurred and included in the caption purchased transportation in the accompanying consolidated statement of income our contract logistics global trade service and certain transportation business engage in certain transaction wherein they act agent revenue from these transaction is recorded on net basis net revenue includes billing to customer le third party charge including transportation or handling cost fee commission and tax and duty contract asset and liabilitiescontract asset include billed and unbilled amount resulting from in transit shipment we have an unconditional right to payment only once all performance obligation have been completed package have been delivered contract asset are generally classified current and the full balance is converted each quarter based on the short term nature of the transaction our contract liability consist of advance payment and billing in excess of revenue the full balance of deferred revenue is converted each quarter based on the short term nature of the transaction gross contract asset related to in transit shipment totaled million and million at may and may respectively contract asset net of deferred unearned revenue were million and million at may

the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable for asset that are to be held and used an impairment is recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flow associated with the asset or group of asset is le than their carrying value if impairment exists an adjustment is made to write the asset down to it fair value and loss is recorded the difference between the carrying value and fair value fair value are determined based on quoted market value discounted cash flow or internal and external appraisal applicable asset to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value we operate integrated transportation network so cash flow for most of our operating asset to be held and used are assessed at network level not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment during we made the decision to permanently retire from service airbus aircraft and related engine at fedex express to align with the need of the domestic network and modernize it aircraft fleet consequence of this decision we recognized noncash impairment charge of million million net of tax or per diluted share in the fedex express segment in in the normal management of our aircraft fleet we routinely idle aircraft and engine temporarily due to maintenance cycle and adjustment of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand level temporarily idled asset are classified available for use and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these asset these temporarily idled asset are assessed for impairment and remaining life on quarterly basis the criterion for determining whether an asset ha been permanently removed from service and result is potentially impaired include but are not limited to our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume level including capacity need during our peak shipping season the introduction of new fleet type or decision to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operation and change to planned service expansion activity at may we had eight aircraft temporarily idled these aircraft have been idled for an average of month and are expected to return to revenue service goodwill goodwill is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net asset of business acquired several factor give rise to goodwill in our acquisition such the expected benefit from synergy of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment in our evaluation of goodwill impairment we perform qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive we proceed to test goodwill for impairment including comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying value including attributable goodwill fair value for our reporting unit is determined using an income or market approach incorporating market participant consideration and management assumption on revenue growth rate operating margin discount rate and expected capital expenditure fair value determination may include both internal and third party valuation unless circumstance otherwise dictate we perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter see note for additional information intangible asset intangible asset primarily include customer relationship technology asset and trademark acquired in business combination intangible asset are amortized over period ranging from to year either on straight line basis or on basis consistent with the pattern in which the economic benefit are realized see note for additional information pension and postretirement healthcare plan our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan are measured using actuarial technique that reflect management assumption for discount rate investment return on plan asset salary increase expected retirement mortality employee turnover and future increase in healthcare cost we determine the discount rate which is required to be the rate at which the projected benefit obligation pbo could be effectively settled of the measurement date with the assistance of actuary who calculate the yield on theoretical portfolio of high grade corporate bond rated aa or better with cash flow that are designed to match our expected benefit payment in future year we use the fair value of plan asset to calculate the expected return on asset eroa for interim and segment reporting purpose our eroa is judgmental estimate which is reviewed on an annual basis and revised appropriate the accounting guidance related to employer accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of these plan we use mark to market or mtm accounting and immediately recognize change in the fair value of plan asset and actuarial gain or loss in our result annually in the fourth quarter each year the annual mtm adjustment is recognized at the corporate level and doe not impact segment result the remaining component of pension and postretirement healthcare expense primarily service and interest cost and the eroa are recorded on quarterly basis only service cost is recognized in segment level operating result income tax deferred income tax are provided for the tax effect of temporary difference between the tax basis of asset and liability and their reported amount in the financial statement the liability method is used to account for income tax which requires deferred tax to be recorded at the statutory rate expected to be in effect when the tax are paid fedex corporationnotes to consolidated financial statement deferred income tax asset represent amount available to reduce income tax payable on taxable income in future year such asset arise because of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability well from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deduction and credit by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategy these source of income rely heavily on estimate to make this determination and thus there is risk that these estimate will have to be revised new information is received to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that deferred tax asset will be recovered valuation allowance is established we believe we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefit related to the remaining net deferred tax asset in our consolidated balance sheet that are not subject to valuation allowance we record the tax for global intangible low taxed income period cost we recognize liability for uncertain income tax position based on two step process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any the second step requires to estimate and measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amount we must determine the probability of various possible outcome we reevaluate these uncertain tax position on quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management these reevaluation are based on factor including but not limited to change in fact or circumstance change in tax law successfully settled issue under audit and new audit activity such change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of tax benefit or an increase to the related provision we classify interest related to income tax liability interest expense and if applicable penalty are recognized component of income tax expense the income tax liability and accrued interest and penalty that are due within one year of the

initial term of month or le are not recognized in the right to use asset and lease liability on the consolidated balance sheet the lease liability are measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the minimum lease payment not yet paid and our incremental borrowing rate which approximates the rate at which we would borrow on collateralized basis over the term of lease in the applicable currency environment the interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not determinable in transaction where we are the lessee for real estate lease we account for

investment strategy to better align plan asset with liability establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension asset is judgmental matter which we review on an annual basis
