is arranged for by berkelycare division of affinity insurance service inc and underwritten by stonebridge casualty insurance company an aegon company while we are currently focused on the travel service described above over time we may evaluate the introduction of other service that we believe could enhance the travel experience of our customer marketing and brand awareness booking com priceline com and agoda com have established widely used and recognized commerce brand through aggressive marketing and promotion campaign in late we re branded our international rental car business rentalcars com and have since marketed that brand worldwide through online advertising during our total online advertising expense were approximately billion substantial portion of which wa spent internationally through internet search engine price comparison and travel research service and affiliate marketing we also invested approximately million in priceline com branded offline advertising in the united state in january booking com launched in the united state it first offline advertising campaign we intend to continue marketing strategy to aggressively promote brand awareness primarily through online mean we use online search engine price comparison and travel research service and affiliate marketing primary mean of generating traffic to our website result our online advertising expense ha increased significantly in recent year trend we expect to continue in addition our online advertising ha grown faster than our gross profit due to brand mix within the priceline group channel mix within our brand and recently lower return on investment roi from our online advertising our international brand are growing faster than our priceline com brand and spend higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising furthermore our brand are generally obtaining an increasing share of traffic through paid online advertising channel finally our online advertising roi have recently been year over year advertising efficiency is impacted by number of factor that are subject to variability including adrs cost per click cancellation rate foreign exchange rate and the extent to which we are successful in converting paid traffic to booking customer and then customer return directly to our website or mobile apps for future booking we recognize substantial majority of online advertising expense incurred at the time of booking but recognize the gross profit for price disclosed hotel and rental car reservation when the travel is completed result online advertising expense may not be recognized in the same period the associated gross profit competition we compete with both online and traditional travel reservation service the market for the travel reservation service we offer is intensely competitive and current and new competitor can launch new service at relatively low cost of our current and potential competitor such google apple and microsoft have access to significantly greater and more diversified resource than we and they may be able to leverage other aspect of their business search or mobile device business to enable to compete more effectively with we currently or potentially will compete with variety of company including internet travel service such expedia hotel com hotwire elong carrentals com and venere which are owned by expedia travelocity lastminute com holiday auto and zuji which are owned by the sabre group orbitz com cheaptickets ebookers hotelclub and ratestogo which are owned by orbitz worldwide laterooms and asiarooms which are owned by tui travel gulliver and octopustravel which are owned by kuoni hotel reservation service and hotel de which are owned by hotel reservation service and autoeurope car trawler ctrip makemytrip rakuten jalan and wotif travel service provider such hotel company airline and rental car company many of which have their own branded website to which they drive business including joint effort by travel service provider such room key an online hotel reservation service owned by several major hotel company large online portal social networking group buying and search company such google yahoo including yahoo travel bing including bing travel facebook groupon and living social traditional travel agency wholesaler and tour operator online travel search service generally referred to meta search service such kayak which we agreed to acquire in november trivago com in which expedia agreed to acquire majority ownership interest in december mobissimo com farechase com qunar cheapflights com and hotelscombined and travel research service that have search functionality such tripadvisor and travelzoo and operator of travel industry reservation database such galileo travelport amadeus and sabre large established internet search engine with substantial resource and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating internet traffic are creating and we believe intend to further create inroad into online travel both in the united state and internationally for example following it acquisition of ita software inc major flight information software company google launched flight search tool that enables consumer to find fare schedule and availability directly on google and excludes participation by online travel agent otas such within the search result google ha also invested in homeaway publicly traded vacation home rental service and launched hotel finder utility that allows consumer to search and compare hotel accommodation based on parameter set by the consumer and that google ha at time placed at or near the top of hotel related search result in addition microsoft ha launched bing travel which search for airfare and hotel reservation online and predicts the best time to purchase them meta search service leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search result for the consumer specific itinerary across travel service provider airline or ota and other website and in many instance compete directly with for customer furthermore certain travel service provider limit ota participation within the meta search result some meta search service that offer consumer the ability to make hotel reservation directly through their website may evolve into more traditional otas meta search service intend to appeal to consumer by showing more detailed travel search result including specific information for their own itinerary than may be available through otas or other website which could lead to travel service provider or others gaining larger share of search traffic or may ultimately lead to search engine executing transaction within their own website if google the largest search engine in the world bing or other leading search engine refer significant traffic to these or other travel service that they develop in the future or otherwise favor supplier website or other travel service website over otas including or if meta search or travel research service limit our participation within their search result it would likely become more difficult and expensive for to generate traffic to our website and therefore to maintain or grow our market share which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation several major hotel company comprising choice hotel international hilton worldwide hyatt intercontinental hotel group wyndham hotel group marriott la quinta and millennium launched room key an online hotel reservation service that competes directly with our hotel reservation service the hotel company that own room key have stated goal of driving consumer directly to their brand website thus reducing the share received by otas they may also attempt to improve their competitive position by offering lower room rate better room availability or additional feature or amenity through room key than are available through service like if room key is successful our share of the online hotel reservation market could be negatively affected and our business could suffer ha been proliferation of new channel through which hotel can offer hotel room reservation for example some hotel offer room reservation through daily deal website such groupon and living social which sell coupon to customer at substantial discount in expedia one of our largest competitor entered into partnership with groupon to sell hotel room reservation to groupon customer under the groupon getaway brand name new entrant such backbid guestmob and tingo well hipmunk and room have developed new and differentiated offering that endeavor to provide saving on hotel room to consumer and that compete directly with if any of these new service are successful we may experience le demand for our service and are likely to face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted hotel room rate widespread adoption of mobile device such the iphone android enabled smart phone and tablet such the ipad coupled with the improved web browsing functionality and development of thousand of useful apps available on these device is driving substantial traffic and commerce activity to mobile platform we have experienced significant shift of business to mobile platform and our advertising partner are also seeing rapid shift of traffic to mobile platform our major competitor and certain new market entrant are offering mobile application for travel product and other functionality including proprietary last minute discount for hotel booking advertising and distribution opportunity may be more limited on mobile device given their smaller screen size the gross profit earned on mobile transaction may be le than typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing pattern for example hotel reservation made on mobile device typically are for shorter length of stay and are not made far in advance further given the device size and technical limitation of tablet and smartphones mobile consumer may not be willing to download multiple apps from multiple travel service provider and instead prefer to use one or limited number of apps for their mobile travel activity result the consumer experience with mobile apps well brand recognition and loyalty are likely to become increasingly important we have made significant progress creating mobile offering which have received strong review solid download trend and are driving material and increasing share of our business we believe that mobile booking present an opportunity for growth and are necessary to maintain and grow our business consumer increasingly turn to mobile device instead of personal computer and to mobile application instead of web browser if we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new user friendly and differentiated mobile offering and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platform or if our mobile apps are not downloaded and used by travel consumer we could lose market share to existing competitor or new entrant and our future growth and result of operation could be adversely affected apple inc one of the most successful company in the world and producer of among other thing the iphone and ipad recently obtained patent for itravel mobile app that would allow traveler to check in for travel reservation in addition apple most recent iphone operating system includes passbook virtual wallet app that hold ticket boarding pass coupon and gift card and along with itravel may be indicative of apple intent to enter the travel reservation business in some capacity apple ha substantial market share in the smart phone category and control integration of offering including travel service into it mobile operating system apple also ha more experience producing and developing mobile apps and ha access to greater resource than we have apple may use or expand itravel passbook siri apple voice recognition concierge service or another mobile app mean of entering the travel reservation marketplace similarly google android operating system is the leading smartphone operating system in the world result google could leverage it android operating system to give it travel service competitive advantage either technically with prominence on it google play app store or within it mobile search result to the extent apple or google use their mobile operating system or app distribution channel to favor their own travel service offering our business could be harmed the launch of room key discussed above is demonstrative of the effort of many hotel airline and rental car company including those with which we conduct business to drive online demand to their own website in lieu of third party distributor such certain airline have attempted to charge additional fee to customer who book airline reservation through an online channel other than their own website furthermore some airline may distribute their ticket exclusively through their own website provider who sell on their own website typically do not charge processing fee and in some instance offer advantage such web only fare bonus mile or loyalty point which could make their offering more attractive to consumer than model like ours see risk factor intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance operation and technology our business is supported by multiple system platform which were designed with an emphasis on scalability performance and reliability the platform are largely independent among booking com priceline com agoda and rentalcars com the software platform and architecture use variety of tool within each corporate implementation including server side java asp net and perl and sql script integrated with oracle mysql and microsoft sql server relational database system these internal platform were designed to include open application protocol interface that can provide connectivity to vendor in the industry in which we operate these include large global system such airline ticket and hotel room reservation system and financial service provider well individual hotel service provider such individual hotel our internet server utilize digital certificate to help conduct secure communication and transaction appropriate the system infrastructure and web and database server of our worldwide operation are primarily hosted in england the netherlands hong kong and two location in the united state each of which provides network connectivity networking infrastructure and hour monitoring and engineering support typical of hosted data center our network operation center is located in our norwalk connecticut headquarters and monitor all web hosting facility all data center facility have continuous power supply system generator redundant server and multiple back up system if one hosting facility were inaccessible for any reason we would need to divert all traffic to another hosting facility which may lead to disruption to our service resulting in foregone transaction and revenue customer service for our international business is provided primarily through in house customer call center we outsource most of the call center and customer service function for our priceline com business and use real time interactive voice response system with transfer capability to our call center and customer service center intellectual property over time and through acquisition we have assembled portfolio of patent trademark service mark copyright domain name and trade secret covering our service we regard the protection of our intellectual property critical to our success we protect our intellectual property right by relying on federal state and common law right in the united state and internationally well variety of administrative procedure we also rely on contractual restriction to protect our proprietary right in our service we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreement with our employee and contractor and nondisclosure agreement with party with we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information we pursue the registration of our domain name trademark and service mark in the united state and internationally we currently hold numerous issued and international patent and pending and international patent application we file additional patent application on new invention appropriate effective trademark copyright patent domain name trade dress and trade secret protection is expensive to maintain and may require litigation we continue to expand internationally we must protect our intellectual property right and other proprietary right in an increasing number of jurisdiction process that is expensive and time consuming and may not be successful in every location see risk factor we face risk related to our intellectual property governmental regulation the service we provide are subject to various federal state foreign and local regulation for example our travel service are subject to law governing the offer and or sale of travel service well law requiring to register seller of travel in certain jurisdiction in addition our service may be subject to various federal state foreign and local taxing see risk factor adverse application of state and local tax law could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation and risk factor we may have exposure to additional tax liability we are subject to federal state and foreign law that require protection of user privacy and user data in our processing of travel transaction we receive and store large volume of personally identifiable data in the united state europe and asia this data is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation in numerous jurisdiction around the world including the commission of the european union through it data protection directive and variation of that directive in the member state of the european union such government action is typically intended to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction in addition our strategy involves rapid expansion into region around the world including asia south america and elsewhere many of which have different legislation regulatory environment and tax law compliance with foreign legal regulatory or tax requirement place demand on our time and resource and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse legal regulatory or tax consequence which may have an adverse effect on our business seasonalitya meaningful amount of retail gross booking are generated early in the year customer plan and reserve their spring and summer vacation in europe and north america however we generally do not recognize associated revenue until future quarter when the travel occurs from cost perspective we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activity they are incurred which is typically in the quarter in which booking are generated result we typically experience our highest level of profitability in the second and third quarter of the year which is when we experience the highest level of booking and travel consumption for the year for our north american and european business however we experience the highest level of booking and travel consumption for our asia pacific and south american business in the first and fourth quarter therefore if these business continue to grow faster than our north american and european business our operating result for the first and fourth quarter of the year may become more significant over time percentage of full year operating result in addition our name your own price service are generally non refundable in nature and accordingly we recognize travel revenue at the time booking is generated however we recognize revenue generated from our retail hotel service at the time that the customer check out of the hotel therefore if our retail hotel business continues to grow faster than our name your own price service we expect our quarterly result to become increasingly impacted by these seasonal factor employee of december we employed approximately employee of which approximately are based in the united state and approximately are based in our international office we also retain independent contractor to support our customer service website content translation and system support function we have never had work stoppage and our employee are not represented by any collective bargaining unit we consider our relation with our employee to be good our future success will depend in part on our ability to continue to attract integrate retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel for whom competition is intense see risk factor we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed the priceline group website we maintain website with the address www booking com www priceline com www agoda com and www rentalcars com among others we are not including the information contained on our website part of or incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form we make

information on the operation of the public reference room may be obtained by calling the sec at sec in addition the priceline com incorporated code of conduct is available through the www priceline com website and any amendment to or waiver from the code of conduct will be disclosed on that website risk factor the following risk factor and other information included in this annual report should be carefully considered the risk and uncertainty described are not the only one we face additional risk and uncertainty not presently known to or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business result of operation or financial condition if any of the following risk occur our business financial condition operating result and cash flow could be materially adversely affected decline or disruption in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance our financial prospect are significantly dependent upon the sale of travel service particularly leisure travel travel including hotel rental car and airline ticket reservation is dependent on discretionary spending level result sale of travel service tend to decline during general economic downturn and recession when consumer engage in le discretionary spending are concerned about unemployment or inflation have reduced access to credit or experience other concern or effect that reduce their ability or willingness to travel accordingly the recent worldwide recession led to weakening in the fundamental demand for our service and an increase in the number of customer who canceled existing travel reservation with further many government around the world including the government and certain european government are operating at large financial deficit disruption in the economy of such country could cause contribute to or be indicative of deteriorating macro economic condition failure to reach political consensus regarding workable solution to these issue ha resulted in high level of uncertainty regarding the future economic outlook this uncertainty well concern over governmental austerity measure including higher tax and reduced government spending could impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand over recent quarter we have experienced decline in transaction growth rate and weaker trend in hotel average daily rate adrs across many region of the world particularly in those european country that appear to be most affected by economic uncertainty we believe that these business trend are likely impacted by weak economic condition and sovereign debt concern the uncertainty of macro economic factor and their impact on consumer behavior across region which may differ make it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trend and the timing and degree of their impact on our market and business which in turn could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business and adversely affect our result of operation during the recent worldwide recession the hotel industry experienced significant decrease in occupancy rate and adrs and an increase in reservation cancellation rate while lower occupancy rate have historically resulted in hotel room provider increasing their distribution of hotel room reservation through third party intermediary such our remuneration for hotel room reservation transaction change proportionately with room price and therefore lower adrs generally have negative effect on our hotel room reservation business and negative effect on our gross profit in addition other unforeseen event beyond our control such higher oil price terrorist attack unusual weather pattern natural disaster such earthquake hurricane tsunami flood volcanic eruption such the april eruption of volcano in iceland travel related health concern including pandemic and epidemic such influenza avian bird flu and sars political instability regional hostility imposition of tax or surcharge by regulatory authority or travel related accident could adversely affect our business and result of operation because these event are largely unpredictable they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumer and therefore demand for our service which can adversely affect our result of operation for example in late hurricane sandy disrupted travel in the northeastern united state in early japan wa struck by major earthquake tsunami and nuclear emergency in october severe flooding in thailand key market for our agoda com business and the asian business of booking com negatively impacted booking volume and cancellation rate in this market in addition in early thailand experienced disruptive civil unrest which caused the temporary relocation of agoda com thailand based operation future natural disaster or civil or political unrest could further disrupt our business and operation we face risk related to the growth rate and expansion of our international business we derive substantial portion of our revenue and have significant operation outside the united state our international operation include the netherlands based hotel reservation service booking com the asia based hotel reservation service agoda com and the based rental car reservation service rentalcars com our international operation have achieved significant year over year growth in their gross booking an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value generally inclusive of all tax and fee of all travel service purchased by our customer this growth rate which ha contributed significantly to our growth in consolidated revenue gross profit and earnings per share ha declined trend we expect to continue the absolute level of our gross booking grows larger other factor may also slow the growth rate of our revenue derived from our international business including for example worldwide economic condition any strengthening of the dollar versus the euro and other currency decline in adrs increase in cancellation adverse in travel market condition and the competitiveness of the market decline in the growth rate of our international business could have negative impact on our future gross profit and earnings per share growth rate and consequence our stock price our strategy involves continued rapid international expansion in region throughout the world many of these region have different custom different currency different level of customer acceptance of the internet and different legislation regulatory environment tax law and level of political stability international market may have strong local competitor with an established brand and travel service provider relationship that may make expansion in that market difficult and costly and take more time than anticipated in addition compliance with foreign legal regulatory or tax requirement place demand on our time and resource and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse legal regulatory or tax consequence if we are unsuccessful in rapidly expanding in new and existing market and managing that expansion our business result of operation and financial condition would be adversely affected certain market in which we operate that are in earlier stage of development have lower operating margin compared to more mature market which could have negative impact on our overall margin these market increase in size over time also we intend to continue to invest in adding hotel and accommodation participant in our service many of the newer property we add especially in highly penetrated market may have fewer room may have lower adrs may have higher credit risk and may appeal to smaller subset of customer for example hostel and bed and breakfast and therefore may also negatively impact our margin the number of our employee worldwide ha grown from le than in the first quarter of to approximately of december which growth is mostly comprised of hire by our international operation including result of our international acquisition result of such rapid expansion the average tenure of our employee ha become shorter we may not be able to hire train retain motivate and manage required personnel which may limit our growth damage our reputation negatively affect our financial performance and otherwise harm our business in addition expansion increase the complexity of our business and place additional strain on our management operation technical performance financial resource and internal financial control and reporting function our current and planned personnel system procedure and control may not be adequate to support and effectively manage this growth and our future operation especially we employ personnel in multiple geographic location around the world we are subject to risk typical of international business including differing economic condition differing custom language and customer expectation change in political climate differing tax structure other regulation and restriction including labor law and custom and foreign exchange rate volatility intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance we compete with both online and traditional travel reservation service the market for the travel reservation service we offer is intensely competitive and current and new competitor can launch new service at relatively low cost some of our current and potential competitor such google apple and microsoft have access to significantly greater and more diversified resource than we do and they may be able to leverage other aspect of their business search or mobile device business to enable them to compete more effectively with we currently or potentially will compete with variety of company including internet travel service such expedia hotel com hotwire elong carrentals com and venere which are owned by expedia travelocity lastminute com holiday auto and zuji which are owned by the sabre group orbitz com cheaptickets ebookers hotelclub and ratestogo which are owned by orbitz worldwide laterooms and asiarooms which are owned by tui travel gulliver and octopustravel which are owned by kuoni hotel reservation service and hotel de which are owned by hotel reservation service and autoeurope car trawler ctrip makemytrip rakuten jalan and wotif travel service provider such hotel company airline and rental car company many of which have their own branded website to which they drive business including joint effort by travel service provider such room key an online hotel reservation service owned by several major hotel company large online portal social networking group buying and search company such google yahoo including yahoo travel bing including bing travel facebook groupon and living social traditional travel agency wholesaler and tour operator online travel search service generally referred to meta search service such kayak which we agreed to acquire in november see note to the consolidated financial statement for more detail about the acquisition trivago com in which expedia agreed to acquire majority ownership interest in december mobissimo com farechase com qunar cheapflights com and hotelscombined and travel research service that have search functionality such tripadvisor and travelzoo and operator of travel industry reservation database generally referred to global distribution system or gd such galileo travelport amadeus and sabre large established internet search engine with substantial resource and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating internet traffic are creating and we believe intend to further create inroad into online travel both in the united state and internationally for example following it acquisition of ita software inc major flight information software company google launched flight search tool that enables consumer to find fare schedule and availability directly on google and excludes participation by online travel agent otas such within the search result google ha also invested in homeaway publicly traded vacation home rental service and launched hotel finder utility that allows consumer to search and compare hotel accommodation based on parameter set by the consumer and that google ha at time placed at or near the top of hotel related search result in addition microsoft ha launched bing travel which search for airfare and hotel reservation online and predicts the best time to purchase them if google the largest search engine in the world bing or other leading search engine refer significant traffic to these or other travel service they develop in the future or otherwise favor supplier website or other travel service website over otas including it would likely become more difficult and expensive for to generate traffic to our website and therefore to maintain or grow our market share which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation meta search service leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search result for the consumer specific itinerary across travel service provider airline or hotel ota and other website and in many instance compete directly with for customer furthermore certain travel service provider limit ota participation within the meta search result some meta search service that offer customer the ability to make hotel reservation directly through their website may evolve into more traditional otas meta search service intend to appeal to consumer by showing more detailed travel search result including specific information for their own itinerary than may be available through otas or other website which could lead to travel service provider or others gaining larger share of search traffic to the extent consumer book travel service through meta search site or directly with supplier after visiting meta search site without using an ota like or if meta search service limit our participation within their search result we may need to increase our advertising or other customer acquisition cost to maintain or grow our booking any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation several major hotel company comprising choice hotel international hilton worldwide hyatt intercontinental hotel group wyndham hotel group marriott la quinta and millennium launched room key an online hotel reservation service that competes directly with our hotel reservation service the hotel company that own room key have stated goal of driving consumer directly to their brand website thus reducing the share received by otas they may also attempt to improve their competitive position by offering lower room rate better room availability or additional feature or amenity through room key than are available through service like ours if room key is successful our share of the online hotel reservation market could be negatively affected and our business could suffer there ha been proliferation of new channel through which hotel can offer hotel room reservation for example some hotel offer discounted room reservation through daily deal website such groupon and living social which sell coupon to customer at substantial discount in expedia one of our largest competitor entered into partnership with groupon to sell hotel room reservation to groupon customer under the groupon getaway brand name new entrant such backbid guestmob and tingo well hipmunk and room have developed new and differentiated offering that endeavor to provide saving on hotel room to consumer and that compete directly with if any of these new service are successful we may experience le demand for our service and are likely to face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted hotel room rate competition in domestic online travel remains intense and online travel company are creating new promotion and consumer value feature in an effort to gain competitive advantage in particular the competition to provide opaque hotel reservation service to consumer an area in which our priceline com business ha been leader ha become more intense for example expedia make opaque hotel room reservation available on it principal website under the name expedia unpublished rate and ha supported this initiative with steeper discount through lower margin with our opaque name your own price hotel booking service the name of the hotel is not disclosed until after booking we believe these offering in particular expedia unpublished rate have adversely impacted the market share and year over year rate for our opaque hotel service which experienced decline in room night reservation in compared to these and other competitor could also launch opaque rental car service which could negatively impact our opaque name your own price rental car service if expedia or others are successful in growing their opaque hotel reservation service we may have le consumer demand for our hotel reservation service over time and we would face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted hotel room rate in an effort to compete more effectively these new offering in we launched express deal semi opaque price disclosed hotel reservation service however express deal may not be successful at recovering or growing domestic hotel reservation service market share result of this increased competition our share of the discount hotel reservation market in the united state could further decrease which would harm our business and result of operation we believe that number of reason including the recent significant year over year increase in retail airfare could cause consumer to engage in increased shopping behavior making travel purchase than they engaged in previously increased shopping behavior reduces our advertising efficiency and effectiveness because traffic becomes le likely to result in purchase on our website and such traffic is more likely to be obtained through paid online advertising channel than through free direct channel further consumer attempt to be more efficient in their shopping behavior they may favor travel service offered by search company or meta search site over otas like which could reduce the traffic to our website increase consumer awareness of our competitor brand and website increase our advertising and other customer acquisition cost and adversely affect our business margin and result of operation the launch of room key discussed above is demonstrative of the effort of many hotel airline and rental car company including those with which we conduct business to drive online demand to their own website in lieu of third party distributor such certain airline have attempted to charge additional fee to customer who book airline reservation through an online channel other than their own website furthermore some airline may distribute their ticket exclusively through their own website provider who sell on their own website typically do not charge processing fee and in some instance offer advantage such web only fare bonus mile or loyalty point which could make their offering more attractive to consumer than model like ours we rely on online advertising channel to enhance our brand awareness and to generate significant amount of traffic to our website we believe that maintaining and expanding the booking com priceline com agoda com and rentalcars com brand along with our other owned brand are important aspect of our effort to attract and retain customer effective online advertising ha been an important factor in our growth and we believe it will continue to be important to our future success our competitor spend increasingly more on advertising we are required to spend more in order to maintain our brand recognition and in the case of online advertising to maintain and grow traffic to our website in addition we have invested considerable money and resource on the establishment and maintenance of the booking com priceline com agoda com and rentalcars com brand and we will continue to invest resource in advertising marketing and other brand building effort to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brand we may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness and acceptance of these brand and even if we are successful in our branding effort such effort may not be cost effective if we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness and acceptance of our brand in cost effective manner our business market share and result of operation would be materially adversely affected our advertising efficiency is impacted by number of factor that are subject to variability and that are outside of our control including adrs cost per click cancellation rate foreign exchange rate and the extent to which we are successful in converting paid traffic to booking customer and then having customer return directly to our website or mobile apps for future booking we use online search engine price comparison and travel research service and affiliate marketing primary mean of generating traffic to our website result our online advertising expense ha increased significantly in recent year trend we expect to continue in addition our online advertising ha grown faster than our gross profit due to brand mix within the priceline group channel mix within our brand and recently lower return on investment roi from our online advertising our international brand are growing faster than our priceline com brand and spend higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising furthermore our brand are generally obtaining an increasing share of traffic through paid online advertising channel finally our online advertising roi have recently been down year over year any reduction in our advertising efficiency could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation whether through reduced gross profit gross profit growth or through advertising expense increasing faster than gross profit and thereby reducing margin and earnings growth trend in consumer adoption and use of mobile device create new challenge and may enable device company such apple to compete directly with widespread adoption of mobile device such the iphone android enabled smart phone and tablet such the ipad coupled with the improved web browsing functionality and development of thousand of useful apps available on these device is driving substantial traffic and commerce activity to mobile platform we have experienced significant shift of business to mobile platform and our advertising partner are also seeing rapid shift of traffic to mobile platform our major competitor and certain new market entrant are offering mobile application for travel product and other functionality including proprietary last minute discount for hotel booking advertising and distribution opportunity may be more limited on mobile device given their smaller screen size the gross profit earned on mobile transaction may be le than typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing pattern for example hotel reservation made on mobile device typically are for shorter length of stay and are not made far in advance further given the device size and technical limitation of tablet and smartphones mobile consumer may not be willing to download multiple apps from multiple travel service provider and instead prefer to use one or limited number of apps for their mobile travel activity result the consumer experience with mobile apps well brand recognition and loyalty are likely to become increasingly important we have made significant progress creating mobile offering which have received strong review solid download trend and are driving material and increasing share of our business we believe that mobile booking present an opportunity for growth and are necessary to maintain and grow our business consumer increasingly turn to mobile device instead of personal computer and to mobile application instead of web browser further many consumer use mobile device based web browser instead of an app result it is increasingly important for to develop and maintain effective mobile website optimized for mobile device to provide customer with appealing easy to use mobile website functionality if we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new user friendly and differentiated mobile offering and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platform or if our mobile apps are not downloaded and used by travel consumer we could lose market share to existing competitor or new entrant and our future growth and result of operation could be adversely affected apple one of the most successful company in the world and producer of among other thing the iphone and ipad recently obtained patent for itravel mobile app that would allow traveler to check in for travel reservation in addition apple most recent iphone operating system includes passbook virtual wallet app that hold ticket boarding pass coupon and gift card and along with itravel may be indicative of apple intent to enter the travel reservation business in some capacity apple ha substantial market share in the smart phone category and control integration of offering including travel service into it mobile operating system apple also ha more experience producing and developing mobile apps and ha access to greater resource than we have apple may use or expand itravel passbook siri apple voice recognition concierge service or another mobile app mean of entering the travel reservation marketplace similarly google android operating system is the leading smart phone operating system in the world result google could leverage it android operating system to give it travel service competitive advantage either technically or with prominence on it google play app store or within it mobile search result to the extent apple or google use their mobile operating system or app distribution channel to favor their own travel service offering our business could be harmed we are exposed to fluctuation in currency exchange rate we conduct substantial majority of our business outside the united state but are reporting our result in dollar result we face exposure to adverse movement in currency exchange rate the financial result of our international business are translated from local currency principally the euro and the british pound sterling into dollar upon consolidation for example strengthening of the euro increase our euro denominated net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income expressed in dollar while weakening of the euro decrease our euro denominated net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income expressed in dollar additionally foreign exchange rate fluctuation on transaction denominated in currency other than the functional currency result in gain and loss that are reflected in our financial statement greece ireland portugal and certain other european union country with high level of sovereign debt have had difficulty refinancing their debt concern around devaluation or abandonment of the euro common currency or that sovereign default risk may become more widespread and could include the united state ha led to significant volatility in the exchange rate between the euro the dollar and other currency sovereign debt issue in the european union could lead to further significant and potentially longer term devaluation of the euro against the dollar which would adversely impact our euro denominated net asset gross booking revenue operating expense and net income expressed in dollar rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed our performance is largely dependent on the talent and effort of highly skilled individual our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all area of our organization in particular the contribution of certain key senior management in the united state europe and asia are critical to the overall management of our business we may not be able to retain the service of any member of our senior management or other key employee the loss of whom could harm our business in addition competition for well qualified employee in all aspect of our business including software engineer mobile communication talent and other technology professional is intense both in the united state and abroad our international success in particular ha led to increased effort by our competitor and others to hire our international employee our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employee and to retain and motivate existing employee if we do not succeed in attracting well qualified employee or retaining and motivating existing employee our business would be adversely affected we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy our processing storage use and disclosure of personal data expose to risk of internal or external security breach and could give rise to liability the security of data when engaging in electronic commerce is essential to maintaining customer and travel service provider confidence in our service any security breach whether instigated internally or externally on our system or other internet based system could significantly harm our reputation and therefore our business brand market share and result of operation we currently require customer who use certain of our service to guarantee their offer with their credit card either online or in some instance through our toll free telephone service it is possible that computer circumvention capability new discovery or advance or other development including our own act or omission could result in compromise or breach of customer transaction data our existing security measure may not be successful in preventing security breach or attack party whether internal external an affiliate or unrelated third party that is able to circumvent our security system could steal customer information or transaction data proprietary information or cause significant interruption in our operation for instance from time to time we have experienced denial of service type attack on our system that have made portion of our website slow or unavailable for period of time in addition in several major company including zappos apple aol linkedin google and yahoo experienced high profile security breach that exposed their user personal information we expend significant resource to protect against security breach and we may need to increase our security related expenditure to maintain or increase our system security or to address problem caused and liability incurred by breach reduction in website availability and response time could cause loss of substantial business volume during the occurrence of any such security breach or attack on our system these issue are likely to become more difficult to manage we expand the number of place where we operate and the tool and technique used in such attack become more advanced security breach could result in negative publicity damage our reputation expose to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject to regulatory penalty and sanction security breach could also cause customer and potential customer to lose confidence in our security and choose to use the service of our competitor which would have negative effect on the value of our brand our market share and our result of operation our insurance policy carry low coverage limit and would likely not be adequate to reimburse for loss caused by security breach we also face risk associated with security breach affecting third party conducting business over the internet consumer generally are concerned with security and privacy on the internet and any publicized security problem could inhibit the growth of the internet and consumer willingness to provide private information or effect commercial transaction on the internet and therefore our service additionally security breach at third party such travel service provider or distributor system upon which we rely could result in negative publicity damage our reputation expose to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject to regulatory penalty and sanction some of our business is conducted with third party marketing affiliate which may generate travel reservation through our infrastructure or through other system security breach at such third party could be perceived by consumer security breach of our system and could result in negative publicity damage our reputation expose to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject to regulatory penalty and sanction in addition such third party may not comply with applicable disclosure requirement which could expose to liability in our processing of travel transaction we receive and store large volume of personally identifiable data this data is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation in numerous jurisdiction around the world including the commission of the european union through it data protection directive and variation of that directive in the member state of the european union this government action is typically intended to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected processed and in or from the governing jurisdiction in many case these law apply not only to third party transaction but also to transfer of information between and our subsidiary these law continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction non compliance with these law could result in penalty or significant legal liability we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulation are expanded to require change in our business practice or if governing jurisdiction interpret or implement their legislation or regulation in way that negatively affect our business result of operation and financial condition we may have exposure to additional tax liability an international business providing travel reservation service around the world we are subject to income tax and non income based tax in both the united state and various foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax and other tax liability although we believe that our tax estimate are reasonable the final determination of tax audit or tax dispute may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accrual the internal revenue service initiated an audit of our and federal income tax return for the first time in the third quarter of we reached an agreement with the irs in june which covered all tax period through december and had no impact on our financial condition result of operation or cash flow to date we have been audited in several taxing jurisdiction with no significant impact on our financial condition result of operation or cash flow if future audit find that additional tax are due we may be subject to incremental tax liability possibly including interest and penalty which could have material adverse effect on our cash flow financial condition and result of operation for example french authority have initiated process to determine whether we should be subject to additional tax obligation in france it is our understanding that several large company including google and microsoft are involved in similar investigation in france while we believe that we comply with french tax law french tax authority may determine that we owe additional tax and may also ass penalty and interest in general government in the united state and europe are increasingly focused on way to increase revenue which ha contributed to an increase in audit activity and harsher stance taken by tax authority any such additional tax or other assessment may be in excess of our current tax provision or may require to modify our business practice in order to reduce our exposure to additional tax in france going forward any of which could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition we will be subject to increased income tax in the event that our foreign cash balance are remitted to the united state of december we held approximately billion of cash and short term investment outside of the united state to date we have used our foreign cash to reinvest in our foreign operation it is our current intention to reinvest our foreign cash in our foreign operation if our foreign cash balance continue to grow and our ability to reinvest those balance diminishes it will become increasingly likely that we will repatriate some of our foreign cash balance to the united state in such event we would likely be subject to additional income tax expense in the united state with respect to our unremitted foreign earnings we would not incur additional income tax payment unless we were to actually repatriate our international cash balance to the united state we would only incur federal alternative minimum tax and certain state income tax long we have net operating loss carryforwards available to offset our taxable income additionally if we were to repatriate foreign cash to the united state it would use portion of our domestic net operating loss carryforwards which could result in being subject to income tax on the earnings of our domestic business sooner than would otherwise have been the case in addition president barack obama administration ha proposed significant change to the international tax law that include limiting deduction for interest expense related to un repatriated foreign source income and putting in place an offshoring tax that would set minimum tax on offshore earnings we can not determine whether all of these proposal will be enacted into law or what if any change may be made to such proposal prior to being enacted into law if the tax law change in manner that increase our tax obligation our result of operation could be adversely impacted we are also subject to non income based tax such value added payroll sale use net worth property and good and service tax in both the united state and various foreign jurisdiction well the potential for hotel occupancy and other related tax in the united state discussed below from time to time we are under audit by tax authority with respect to these non income based tax and may have exposure to additional non income based tax liability adverse application of state and local tax law could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation number of jurisdiction in the united state have initiated lawsuit against online travel company including related to among other thing the payment of hotel occupancy and other related tax state and local sale tax and general excise tax in addition number of state county and municipality have initiated audit proceeding issued proposed tax assessment or started inquiry relating to the payment of hotel occupancy and other related tax see note to the consolidated financial statement for description of these pending case and proceeding additional state and local jurisdiction are likely to assert that we are subject to among other thing hotel occupancy and other related tax and could seek to collect such tax either retroactively or prospectively or both connection with some hotel occupancy tax audit and assessment we may be required to pay any assessed tax which amount may be substantial prior to being allowed to contest the assessment and the applicability of the law in judicial proceeding this requirement is commonly referred to pay to play or pay first payment of these amount if any is not an admission that we believe that we are subject to such tax and even if we make such payment we intend to continue to vigorously assert our position that we should not be subject to such tax litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse development in these pending or future case and proceeding for example in september the superior court in the district of columbia granted summary judgment in favor of the city and against online travel company result we are required to remit sale tax on our margin and we increased our accrual for hotel occupancy and other related tax with corresponding charge to cost of revenue by approximately million including estimated interest and penalty in september similarly in january the tax appeal court for the state of hawaii held that online travel company including are liable for the state general excise tax on the full amount the online travel company collect from the customer for hotel reservation without any offset for amount passed through to the hotel result we increased our accrual for hotel occupancy and other related tax with corresponding charge to cost of revenue by approximately million including estimated interest and penalty in december we intend to appeal this decision and we may be required to pay all or some of that amount prior to proceeding with the appeal these decision and any similar decision in other jurisdiction could have material adverse effect on our business margin and result of operation an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation may encourage the commencement of additional litigation audit proceeding or other regulatory inquiry in addition an unfavorable outcome or settlement of these action or proceeding could result in substantial liability for past and or future booking including among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost there have been and will continue to be substantial ongoing cost which may include pay first payment associated with defending our position in pending and any future case or proceeding an adverse outcome in one or more of these unresolved proceeding could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation and could be material to our result of operation or cash flow in any given operating period to the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that we have tax collection responsibility or we determine that we have such responsibility with respect to future transaction we may collect any such additional tax obligation from our customer which would have the effect of increasing the cost of hotel reservation to our customer and consequently could make our hotel reservation service le competitive versus the website of other otcs or hotel company website and reduce hotel reservation transaction alternatively we could choose to reduce the compensation for our service on merchant hotel transaction either action could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation in many of the judicial and other proceeding initiated to date the taxing jurisdiction seek not only historical tax that are claimed to be owed on our gross profit but also among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost therefore any liability associated with hotel occupancy tax matter is not constrained to our liability for tax owed on our historical gross profit but may also include among other thing penalty interest and attorney fee to date the majority of the taxing jurisdiction in which we facilitate hotel reservation have not asserted that tax are due and payable on our merchant hotel business with respect to taxing jurisdiction that have not initiated proceeding to date it is possible that they will do in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statute and seek to collect tax from only on prospective basis our stock price is highly volatile the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuation in response to factor such the following some of which are beyond our control operating result that vary from the expectation of security analyst and investor quarterly variation in our operating result change in expectation to our future financial performance including financial estimate by security analyst and investor worldwide economic condition in general and in europe in particular fluctuation in currency exchange rate particularly between the dollar and the euro announcement of technological innovation or new service by or our competitor change in our capital structure change in market valuation of other internet or online service company announcement by or our competitor of price reduction promotion significant contract acquisition strategic partnership joint venture or capital commitment loss of major travel service provider participant such hotel chain rental car company or airline from our service change in the status of our intellectual property right lack of success in the expansion of our business model geographically announcement by third party of significant claim or initiation of proceeding against or adverse development in pending proceeding occurrence of significant security breach addition or departure of key personnel and trading volume fluctuation sale of substantial number of share of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock by introducing large number of seller to the market given the volatility that exists for our share such sale could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly in addition fluctuation in our stock price and our price to earnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum hedge or day trading investor who often shift fund into and out of stock rapidly exacerbating price fluctuation in either direction particularly when viewed on quarterly basis the trading price of internet company stock in general including ours have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuation to the extent that the public perception of the prospect of internet or commerce company is negative our stock price could decline regardless of our result other broad market and industry factor may decrease the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance market fluctuation well general political and economic condition such recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuation also may decrease the market price of our common stock negative market condition could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or the value of our stock for purpose of acquiring other company or business we have in the past been defendant in security class action litigation

rental car or airline ticket or to make hotel room reservation rental car or airline ticket available for any particular route in any geographic area or at any particular price during the course of our business we are in continuous dialogue with our major provider about the nature and extent of their participation in our system significant reduction on the part of any of our major travel service provider or provider that are particularly popular with customer of their participation in our system for sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal could have material adverse effect on our business market share and result of operation to the extent any of those major or popular travel service provider ceased to participate in our system in favor of one of our competitor system or decided to require consumer to purchase service directly from them our business market share and result of operation could be harmed our business could be negatively affected by change in search engine algorithm and dynamic or traffic generating arrangement we utilize internet search engine and other travel demand aggregation website principally through the purchase of travel related keywords to generate traffic to our website in particular we rely to significant extent upon google to generate business and to much lesser extent other search engine and other travel demand aggregation website search engine such google frequently update and change the logic which determines the placement and display of result of consumer search such that the placement of link to our site can be negatively affected for example google launched hotel finder utility that allows consumer to search and compare hotel accommodation based on parameter set by the consumer and that google ha at time placed at or near the top of hotel related search result if google change it search algorithm in manner that is competitively disadvantageous to whether to support it own travel related service or otherwise our ability to generate traffic to our website would be harmed which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business market share and result of operation significant amount of our website traffic is directed to our website through participation in pay per click advertising campaign on internet search engine whose pricing and operating dynamic can experience rapid change commercially technically and competitively in addition we purchase website traffic from number of source including some operated by our competitor in the form of pay per click arrangement that can be terminated with little or no notice if one or more of such arrangement is terminated our business market share and result of operation could be adversely affected in addition we rely on various third party distribution channel marketing affiliate to distribute hotel room and rental car reservation should one or more of such third party cease distribution of reservation made through or suffer deterioration in it search engine ranking due to change in search engine algorithm or otherwise our business and result of operation could be negatively affected our pending acquisition of kayak is

our ability to attract and retain key kayak management sale marketing operation and technical personnel if our pending acquisition of kayak is completed we will be subject to risk associated with

kayak ability to expand it offering into international market further integration of or transition from kayak business process control it system employment policy and other similar policy procedure or system may involve significant time and resource and could result in significant diversion of management focus and resource from the operation of our business and kayak business system capacity constraint and system failure could harm our business we have experienced rapid growth in customer traffic to our website and through our mobile apps the number of hotel on our extranets and the geographic breadth of our operation if our system can not be expanded to cope with increased demand or fail to perform we could experience unanticipated disruption in service slower response time decreased customer service and customer satisfaction and delay in the introduction of new service any of which could impair our reputation damage our brand and materially and adversely affect our result of operation while we do maintain redundant system and hosting service it is possible that we could experience an interruption in our business and we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate for all loss that may occur our computer hardware for operating our service is currently located at hosting facility around the world these system and operation are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error flood fire power loss telecommunication failure and similar event they are also subject to break in sabotage intentional act of vandalism and similar misconduct despite any precaution we may take the occurrence of any disruption of service due to any such misconduct natural disaster or other unanticipated problem at such facility or the failure by such facility to provide our required data communication capacity could result in lengthy interruption or delay in our service any system failure that cause an interruption or delay in service could impair our reputation damage our brand or result in consumer choosing to use competitive service any of which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation we rely on certain third party computer system and third party service provider including gd and computerized central reservation system of the hotel rental car and airline industry to satisfy demand for our airline ticket and portion of our priceline com business hotel room reservation and car rental reservation any interruption in these third party service system or deterioration in their performance could prevent from booking related hotel room rental car and airline reservation and have material adverse effect on our business our brand and our result of operation our agreement with some third party service provider are terminable upon short notice and often do not provide recourse for service interruption in the event our arrangement with any of such third party is terminated we may not be able to find an alternative source of system support on timely basis or on commercially reasonable term and result it could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation we depend upon various third party to process credit card for our merchant transaction around the world in addition we rely on third party to provide credit card number which we use payment mechanism for merchant hotel transaction if any such third party were wholly or partially compromised our cash flow could be disrupted or we may not be able to generate merchant hotel transaction and related revenue until such time replacement process could be put in place with different vendor we do not have completely formalized or comprehensive disaster recovery plan in every geographic region in which we conduct business in the event of certain system failure we may not be able to switch to back up system immediately and the time to full recovery could be prolonged like many online business we have experienced system failure from time to time in addition to placing increased burden on our engineering staff these outage create significant amount of user question and complaint that need to be addressed by our customer support personnel any unscheduled interruption in our service could result in an immediate loss of revenue that can be substantial increase customer service cost harm our reputation and cause some consumer to switch to our competitor if we experience frequent or persistent system failure our reputation and brand could be permanently and significantly harmed we have taken and continue to take step to increase the reliability and redundancy of our system these step are expensive may reduce our margin and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime use both internally developed system and third party system to operate our service including transaction processing order management and financial system if the number of consumer using our service increase substantially or if critical third party system stop operating designed we will need to significantly expand and upgrade our technology transaction processing system financial and accounting system and other infrastructure we may not be able to upgrade our system and infrastructure to accommodate such condition in timely manner and depending on the third party system affected our transactional financial and accounting system could be impacted for meaningful amount of time before upgrade expansion or repair our financial result will likely be materially impacted by payment of income tax in the future until our domestic net operating loss carryforwards are utilized or expire we do not expect to make tax payment on our income except for federal alternative minimum tax and state income tax however we expect to pay foreign tax on our foreign income we expect that our international business will continue to generate most of our revenue and profit and will continue to grow pretax income at higher rate than our business and therefore we expect that our tax payment will continue to increase any increase in our effective tax rate would have an adverse effect on our result of operation we may not be able to keep up with rapid technological change the market in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standard consolidation frequent new service announcement introduction and enhancement and changing consumer demand we may not be able to keep up with these rapid change in addition these market characteristic are heightened by the progress of technology adoption in various market including the continuing adoption of the internet and online commerce in certain geography and the emergence and growth of the use of smart phone and tablet for mobile commerce transaction including through the increasing use of mobile apps result our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technology to adapt our service to evolving industry standard and to continually improve the performance feature and reliability of our service in response to competitive service offering and the evolving demand of the marketplace in particular we believe that it will be increasingly important for to effectively offer our service through mobile application and mobile optimized website on smart phone and tablet any failure by to successfully develop and achieve customer adoption of our mobile application and mobile optimized website would likely have material and adverse effect on our growth market share business and result of operation we believe that ease of use comprehensive functionality and the look and feel of our mobile apps and mobile optimized website will be increasingly competitively critical consumer obtain more of their travel service through mobile device result we intend to continue to spend significant resource maintaining developing and enhancing our website mobile apps and mobile optimized website and other technology in addition the widespread adoption of new internet networking or telecommunication technology or other technological change could require to incur substantial expenditure to modify or adapt our service or infrastructure to those new technology regulatory and legal requirement and uncertainty could harm our business the service we offer are subject to regulation including without limitation law ordinance rule and other regulation of national and local government and regulatory authority around the world many of which are evolving and subject to the possibility of new or revised interpretation our ability to provide our service is and will continue to be affected by such regulation the implementation of unfavorable regulation or unfavorable interpretation of existing regulation by judicial or regulatory body could require to incur significant compliance cost cause the development of the affected market to become impractical and otherwise have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation compliance with foreign and law and regulation increase our cost of business in foreign jurisdiction these law and regulation include the foreign corrupt practice act the bribery act and local law which also prohibit corrupt payment to governmental official or third party data privacy requirement labor relation law tax law antitrust or competition law or sanctioned country or sanctioned person mandate and consumer protection law violation of these law and regulation could result in fine and or criminal sanction against our officer or our employee and or prohibition on the conduct of our business any such violation could result in prohibition on our ability to offer our service in one or more country could delay or prevent potential acquisition and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion effort our ability to attract and retain employee our business and our operating result our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risk and manage these difficulty we are also subject to variety of other regulatory and legal risk and challenge in managing an organization operating in various country including those related to regulatory change or other government action additional complexity to comply with regulation in multiple jurisdiction well overlapping or inconsistent legal regime in particular with respect to tax labor consumer protection digital content advertising promotion privacy and anti trust law our ability to repatriate fund held by our foreign subsidiary to the united state at favorable tax rate difficulty in transferring fund from or converting currency in certain country and reduced protection for intellectual property right in some country our business ha grown substantially over the last several year and continues to expand into new geographical location in addition we have made effort and expect to make further effort to integrate access to travel service across our various brand these change add complexity to legal and tax compliance and our increased size and operating history may increase the likelihood that we will be subject to audit by taxing authority in various jurisdiction in july the office of fair trading the oft the competition authority in the united kingdom issued statement of objection so to booking com which set out the oft preliminary view on it belief booking com and others in the online hotel reservation sector have allegedly breached and competition law the so alleges among other thing that there are agreement or concerted practice between hotel and booking com and at least one other online travel company that restrict booking com and the other travel company ability to discount hotel room reservation which the oft alleges is form of resale price maintenance we dispute the allegation against booking com in the so and intend to contest them vigorously booking com run an agency model hotel reservation platform in which hotel have complete discretion and control over setting the price that appear on the booking com website booking com is facilitator of hotel room reservation it doe not take possession of or title to hotel room and is not reseller of hotel room because booking com play no role in price setting doe not control hotel pricing and doe not resell hotel room it doe not believe that it engages in the conduct alleged in the so we will have the right to respond to the allegation in the so in writing and orally if the oft chooses to maintain it objection after hearing booking com response the oft will issue decision which will state it case against booking com and others under investigation we expect that final infringement decision if any will be issued at the earliest in the second half of we will have the opportunity should we choose to do so to challenge an adverse decision by the oft in the court in connection with decision the oft may impose fine against booking com we estimate that fine could range from to approximately million fine in this amount could adversely impact our cash flow result of operation and financial condition in addition the oft may require change to booking com business practice including change to it approach to pricing and the use of most favored nation clause in contract with hotel we are unable at this time to predict the outcome of the proceeding before the oft and if necessary before the court and the impact of change to our business practice that may be required if any on our business financial condition and result of operation in addition we are also unable to predict at this time the extent to which other regulatory authority may pursue similar claim against newly enacted cookie law could negatively impact the way we do business on june an amendment to the dutch telecommunication act became effective one of the provision of the amended act is new regulation on the use of cooky cookie is text file that is stored on user web browser by website cooky are common tool used by thousand of website such booking com which is based in the netherlands and priceline com to among other thing store or gather information remember log on detail so user doe not have to re enter them when revisiting site and enhance the user experience on website cooky are valuable tool for website like booking com and priceline com to improve customer experience and increase conversion on their website the amended act requires website such booking com to provide dutch user with clear and comprehensive information about the storage and use of certain cooky and obtain prior consent from the user before placing certain cooky on user web browser consent may be accomplished by asking user to check box to consent to the use of the cooky before proceeding on the website opt in consent the amended act implement certain provision of the european union eprivacy directive which requires member country to adopt regulation governing the use of cooky by website servicing customer from the european union compliance with the amended act well any similarly restrictive cookie regulation that may be adopted by other european union country requiring opt in consent before certain cooky can be placed on user web browser might adversely affect our ability in particular booking com ability to serve certain customer in the manner we currently do and impair our ability to continue to improve and optimize performance on our website which could in turn negatively affect experience using our service result these regulation could have material adverse effect on our business market share and result of operation we face risk related to our intellectual property we regard our intellectual property critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreement with our employee customer partner and others to protect our proprietary right if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property it could have material adverse effect on our business brand and result of operation while we believe that our issued patent and pending patent application help to protect our business there can be no assurance that third party will not have or obtain one or more patent that can prevent from practicing feature of our business or that will require to pay for license to use those feature our operation do not or will not infringe valid enforceable patent of third party we can successfully defend our patent against challenge by third party pending patent application will result in the issuance of patent competitor or potential competitor will not devise new method of competing with that are not covered by our patent or patent application because of variation in the application of our business model to each of our service our patent will be effective in preventing one or more third party from utilizing copycat business model to offer the same service in one or more category new prior art will not be discovered that may diminish the value of or invalidate an issued patent or legislative or judicial action will not directly or indirectly affect the scope and validity of any of our patent right there ha been recent discussion in the press regarding the examination and issuance of so called business method patent result the united state patent and trademark office ha indicated that it intends to intensify the review process applicable to such patent application the new procedure are not expected to have direct effect on patent already granted we can not anticipate what effect if any the new review process will have on our pending patent application in addition there ha been recent discussion in various federal court proceeding regarding the patentability and validity of business method patent the supreme court in bilski kappos partially addressed the patentability of so called business method we can not anticipate what effect if any any new federal court decision or new legislation will have on our issued patent or pending patent application we pursue the registration of our trademark and service mark in the united state and internationally however effective trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our service are made available online we have licensed in the past and expect to license in the future certain of our proprietary right such trademark or copyrighted material to third party these licensee may take action that might diminish the value of our proprietary right or harm our reputation from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we have been subject to and are currently subject to legal proceeding and claim relating to the intellectual property right of others and we expect that third party will continue to assert intellectual property claim in particular patent claim against particularly we expand the complexity and scope of our business we endeavor to defend our intellectual property right diligently but intellectual property litigation is extremely expensive and time consuming and ha and is likely to continue to divert managerial attention and resource from our business objective successful infringement claim against could result in significant monetary liability or prevent from operating our business or portion of our business in addition resolution of claim may require to obtain license to use intellectual property right belonging to third party which may be expensive to procure or possibly to cease using those right altogether any of these event could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation or financial condition business is exposed to risk associated with processing credit card transaction our result have been negatively impacted by purchase made using fraudulent credit card because we act the merchant of record in majority of our priceline com transaction well those of agoda com and rentalcars com we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit card on our website well other payment dispute with our customer additionally we are held liable for accepting fraudulent credit card in certain retail transaction when we do not act merchant of record accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card chargebacks if we are unable to combat the use of fraudulent credit card on our website our business result of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition in the event that one of our major supplier voluntarily or involuntarily declares bankruptcy we could experience an increase in credit card chargebacks from customer with travel reservation with such supplier for example airline that participate in our system and declare bankruptcy or cease operation may be unable or unwilling to honor ticket sold for their flight our policy in such event is to direct customer seeking refund or exchange to the airline and not to provide remedy because we are the merchant of record on sale of name your own price airline ticket to our customer however we could experience significant increase in demand for refund or credit card chargebacks from customer which could materially adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition for example in april aloha airline and ata airline each ceased operation and we experienced an increase in credit card chargebacks from customer with ticket on those airline agoda com and rentalcars com process credit card transaction and operate in numerous currency credit card cost are typically higher for foreign currency transaction and in instance where cancellation occur we are party to legal proceeding which if adversely decided could materially adversely affect we are party to the legal proceeding described in part item below and note to the consolidated financial statement these action may increase our expense and an adverse outcome in any of such action could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition however we believe that adverse determination in more of the pending proceeding than currently anticipated would not have material impact on our liquidity due to our available cash resource investment in new business strategy and acquisition could disrupt our ongoing business and present risk not originally contemplated we have invested and in the future may invest in new business strategy or acquisition such endeavor may involve significant risk and uncertainty including distraction of management from current operation greater than expected liability and expense inadequate return of capital and unidentified issue not discovered in our investigation and evaluation of those strategy and acquisition we may decide to make minority investment including through joint venture in which we have limited or no management or operational control the controlling person in such case may have business interest strategy or goal that are inconsistent with ours and decision of the company or venture in which we invested may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investment further we may issue share of our common stock in these transaction which could result in dilution to our stockholder item unresolved staff comment none item property our executive administrative and operating office and network operation center are located in approximately square foot of leased office space located in norwalk connecticut we also lease approximately square foot of office space in grand rapid michigan booking com limited lease approximately square foot of office space in cambridge england booking com lease approximately square foot of office space in amsterdam netherlands and in other country in support of it international operation agoda com lease approximately square foot of office space in bangkok thailand and in other country in support of it international operation rentalcars com lease approximately square foot of office space in manchester england we do not own any real estate of december we believe that our existing facility are adequate to meet our current requirement and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available needed to accommodate any further expansion of corporate operation item legal proceeding litigation related to hotel occupancy and other related taxeswe and certain third party defendant online travel company otcs are currently involved in approximately forty lawsuit including certified and putative class action brought by or against state city and county over issue involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other related tax state and local sale tax and general excise tax and our merchant hotel business our subsidiary lowestfare com llc and travelweb llc are named in some but not all of these case generally each complaint alleges among other thing that the defendant violated each jurisdiction respective hotel occupancy tax ordinance with respect to the charge and remittance of amount to cover tax under each law each complaint typically seek compensatory damage disgorgement penalty available by law attorney fee and other relief we are also involved in one consumer lawsuit relating to among other thing the payment of hotel occupancy tax and service fee in addition approximately seventy municipality or county and at least twelve state have initiated audit proceeding including proceeding initiated by more than forty municipality in california issued proposed tax assessment or started inquiry relating to the payment of hotel occupancy and other related tax additional state and local jurisdiction are likely to assert that we are subject to among other thing hotel occupancy and other related tax and could seek to collect such tax retroactively and or prospectively with respect to the principal claim in these matter we believe that the law at issue do not apply to the service we provide namely the facilitation of reservation and therefore that we do not owe the tax that are claimed to be owed rather we believe that the law at issue generally impose hotel occupancy and other related tax on entity that own operate or control hotel or similar business or furnish or provide hotel room or similar accommodation in addition in many of these matter the taxing jurisdiction have asserted claim for conversion essentially that we have collected tax and wrongfully pocketed those tax dollar claim that we believe is without basis and have vigorously contested the taxing jurisdiction that are currently involved in litigation and other proceeding with and that may be involved in future proceeding have asserted contrary position and will likely continue to do so from time to time we have found it expedient to settle and may in the future agree to settle claim pending in these matter without conceding that the claim at issue are meritorious or that the claimed tax are in fact due to be paid in connection with some of these tax audit and assessment we may be required to pay any assessed tax which amount may be substantial prior to being allowed to contest the assessment and the applicability of the law in judicial proceeding this requirement is commonly referred to pay to play or pay first we have successfully argued against pay first requirement asserted in one california proceeding but had to pay first in two california city for example the city of san francisco assessed approximately million an amount that includes interest and penalty relating to hotel occupancy tax which we paid in july and issued second assessment totaling approximately million which we paid in january payment of these amount if any is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such tax and even if such payment are made we intend to continue to assert our position vigorously that we should not be subject to such tax in the san francisco action for example the court ruled on february that we and other otcs do not owe transient accommodation tax to the city and ordered the city to refund the pay first amount paid in july we will also seek refund of the amount paid first in january it is possible the city may take the position that it need not refund the pay first amount until after it ha exhausted all appeal in january the tax appeal court for the state of hawaii held that we and other otcs are not liable for the state transient accommodation tax but held that the otcs including are liable for the state general excise tax on the full amount the otc collect from the customer for hotel room reservation without any offset for amount passed through to the hotel result we increased our accrual for hotel occupancy and other related tax with corresponding charge to cost of revenue by approximately million including estimated interest and penalty in december further we may be required to pay that amount prior to appealing the tax appeal court decision we intend to appeal this decision litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse development in these pending or future case and proceeding for example in september the superior court in the district of columbia granted summary judgment in favor of the city and against otcs ruling that tax is due on the otc margin and service fee result we increased our accrual for hotel occupancy and other related tax with corresponding charge to cost of revenue by approximately million including interest in addition in october jury in san antonio class action found that we and the other otcs that are defendant in the lawsuit control hotel for purpose of the local hotel occupancy tax ordinance at issue and are therefore subject to the requirement of those ordinance on july the san antonio court issued finding of fact and conclusion of law in connection with the case in addition to ruling that hotel tax wa due from defendant on the markup and service fee the court held defendant liable for penalty and interest per the term of each city applicable ordinance but penalty at fifteen percent of the total amount of unpaid tax at the time of entry of judgment ordinance without penalty provision are assessed fifteen percent penalty under the texas tax code we expect judgment to be entered by the court we intend to vigorously pursue an appeal of the judgment on legal and factual ground an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation may encourage the commencement of additional litigation audit proceeding or other regulatory inquiry in addition an unfavorable outcome or settlement of these action or proceeding could result in substantial liability for past and or future booking including among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost there have been and will continue to be substantial ongoing cost which may include pay first payment associated with defending our position in pending and any future case or proceeding an adverse outcome in one or more of these unresolved proceeding could have material adverse effect on our business and could be material to our result of operation or cash flow in any given operating period to the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that we have tax collection responsibility or we determine that we have such responsibility with respect to future transaction we may collect any such additional tax obligation from our customer which would have the effect of increasing the cost of hotel reservation to our customer and consequently could make our hotel reservation service le competitive versus the website of other otcs or hotel company website and reduce hotel reservation transaction alternatively we could choose to reduce the compensation for our service on merchant hotel transaction either action could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation we estimate that since our inception through december we have earned aggregate gross profit including fee from our entire merchant hotel business which includes among other thing the differential between the price paid by customer for our service and the cost of the underlying room of approximately billion this gross profit wa earned in over thousand taxing jurisdiction that we believe have aggregate tax rate which may include hotel occupancy tax and state and local tax among other tax associated with typical transaction between consumer and hotel that generally range from approximately to approximately depending on the jurisdiction in many of the judicial and other proceeding initiated to date the taxing jurisdiction seek not only historical tax that are claimed to be owed on our gross profit but also among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost therefore any liability associated with hotel occupancy tax matter is not constrained to our liability for tax owed on our historical gross profit but may also include among other thing penalty interest and attorney fee to date the majority of the taxing jurisdiction in which we facilitate hotel reservation have not asserted that tax are due and payable on our merchant hotel business with respect to taxing jurisdiction that have not initiated proceeding to date it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statute and seek to collect tax from only on prospective basis reserve for hotel occupancy and other related tax result of this litigation and other attempt by jurisdiction to levy similar tax we have established an accrual for the potential resolution of issue related to hotel occupancy and other related tax in the amount of approximately million of december compared to approximately million of december which includes among other thing amount related to the litigation in the state of hawaii district of columbia and san antonio the accrual is based on our estimate of the probable cost of resolving these issue our legal expense for these matter are expensed incurred and are not reflected in the amount accrued the actual cost may be le or greater potentially significantly than the liability recorded an estimate for reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount accrued can not be reasonably made development in and after the year ended december in the year ended december six new action commenced state of mississippi priceline com inc et al hind county chancery court filed january is an action brought by the attorney general of mississippi on behalf of the state and it local government asserting violation of the state hotel occupancy tax and also asserts claim under mississippi consumer protection statute

trading the oft the competition authority in the united kingdom issued statement of objection so to booking com which set out the oft preliminary view on why it belief booking com and others in the hotel online booking sector have allegedly breached and competition law the so alleges among other thing that there are agreement or concerted practice between hotel and booking com and at least one other otc that restrict booking com and the other travel company ability to discount hotel room reservation which the oft alleges is form of resale price maintenance we dispute the allegation in the so and intend to contest them vigorously booking com run an agency model hotel reservation platform in which hotel have complete discretion and control over setting the price that appear on the booking com website booking com is facilitator of hotel room reservation it doe not take possession of or title to hotel room and is not reseller of hotel room because booking com play no role in price setting doe not control hotel pricing and doe not resell hotel room it doe not believe that it engages in the conduct alleged in the so we will have the right to respond to the allegation in the so in writing and orally which we expect to do in the first half of if the oft chooses to maintain it objection after hearing booking com response the oft will issue decision which will state it case against booking com and others under investigation we expect that final infringement decision if any will be issued at the earliest in the second half of we will have the opportunity to challenge an adverse decision by the oft in the court in connection with decision the oft may impose fine against booking com we estimate that fine could range from to approximately million fine in this amount could adversely impact our cash flow and result of operation in addition the oft may require change to booking com business practice including change to it approach to pricing and the use of most favored nation clause in contract with hotel we are unable at this time to predict the outcome of the proceeding before the oft and if necessary before the court and the impact of change to our

materially from the result discussed in the forward looking statement factor that might cause those difference include those discussed in risk factor and elsewhere in this form overview we are leading online travel company that offer our customer hotel and accommodation reservation at over property worldwide of february through the booking com priceline com and agoda com brand in the united state we also offer our customer reservation for car rental airline ticket vacation package destination service and cruise through the priceline com brand we offer car rental reservation worldwide through rentalcars com formerly known traveljigsaw we launched our business in the united state in under the priceline com brand and have since expanded our operation to include booking com agoda com and rentalcars com which are independently managed and operated international brand our principal goal is to serve our customer with worldwide leadership in online hotel accommodation and rental car reservation our business is driven primarily by international result during the year ended december our international business the substantial majority of which is generated by booking com represented approximately of our gross booking an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value generally inclusive of all tax and fee of all travel service purchased by our customer and approximately of our consolidated operating income given that our international business is primarily comprised of hotel reservation service and that hotel reservation also represent significant majority of our domestic business gross profit earned in connection with the reservation of hotel room night represents substantial majority of our gross profit our priceline com brand in the united state offer merchant name your own price travel service sometimes referred to opaque travel service because certain element of the service are not disclosed to the customer prior to booking which are recorded in revenue on gross basis and have associated cost of revenue retail or price disclosed travel service including semi opaque travel service offered by both our and international brand are recorded in revenue on net basis and have no associated cost of revenue therefore revenue increase and decrease are impacted by change in the mix of our revenue between name your own price and retail travel service gross profit reflects the net margin earned for both our name your own price and retail travel service consequently gross profit ha become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business at present we derive substantially all of our gross profit from the following source commission earned from facilitating reservation of price disclosed hotel rental car cruise and other travel service transaction gross profit and customer processing fee from our price disclosed hotel rental car and vacation package reservation service transaction gross profit and customer processing fee from our name your own price hotel rental car and airline ticket reservation service global distribution system gd reservation booking fee related to our name your own price hotel rental car and airline ticket reservation service and price disclosed airline ticket and rental car service and other gross profit derived primarily from selling advertising on our website over the last several year we have experienced strong growth in the number of hotel room night reservation booked through our hotel reservation service we believe this growth is the result of among other thing the broader shift of travel purchase from offline to online the high growth of travel overall in emerging market such asia pacific and south america and the continued innovation and execution by our team around the world to build hotel supply content and distribution and to improve the customer experience on our website we experienced strong year over year growth in recent year though that growth ha generally decelerated for example in the fourth quarter of our hotel room night growth wa substantial deceleration from in the fourth quarter of given the sheer size of our hotel reservation business we believe it is highly likely that our year over year growth rate will continue to decelerate though the rate of deceleration may not be consistent for example our fourth quarter room night growth of reflects slight acceleration from in the quarter of driven in part by high rate of growth in asia pacific and south america which typically represent larger proportion of our business in the fourth quarter based on seasonality however we expect the long term deceleration trend to continue and we therefore expect to experience further deceleration in growth rate in the first quarter of and beyond many government around the world including the government and certain european government are operating at large financial deficit failure to reach political consensus regarding workable solution to these issue ha resulted in high level of uncertainty regarding the future economic outlook this uncertainty well concern over governmental austerity measure including higher tax and reduced government spending could impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand over recent quarter we have experienced decline in transaction growth rate and weaker trend in hotel average daily rate adrs across many region of the world particularly in those european country that appear to be most affected by economic uncertainty we believe that these business trend are likely impacted by weak economic condition and sovereign debt concern the uncertainty of macro economic factor and their impact on consumer behavior across region which may differ make it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trend and the timing and degree of their impact on our market and business which in turn could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business and adversely affect our result of operation large established internet search engine with substantial resource and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating internet traffic are creating and we believe intend to further create inroad into online travel both in the united state and internationally for example following it acquisition of ita software inc major flight information software company google launched flight search tool that enables consumer to find fare schedule and availability directly on google and excludes participation by online travel agent otas such within the search result google ha also invested in homeaway publicly traded vacation home rental service and launched hotel finder utility that allows consumer to search and compare hotel accommodation based on parameter set by the consumer and that google ha at time placed at or near the top of hotel related search result in addition microsoft ha launched bing travel which search for airfare and hotel reservation online and predicts the best time to purchase them meta search service leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search result for the consumer specific itinerary across travel service provider airline or hotel ota and other website and in many instance compete directly with for customer furthermore certain travel service provider limit ota participation within the meta search result some meta search service that offer consumer the ability to make hotel reservation directly through their website may evolve into more traditional otas meta search service intend to appeal to consumer by showing more detailed travel search result including specific information for their own itinerary than may be available through otas or other website which could lead to travel service provider or others gaining larger share of search traffic or may ultimately lead to search engine executing transaction within their own website if google the largest search engine in the world bing or other leading search engine refer significant traffic to these or other travel service that they develop in the future or otherwise favor supplier website or other travel service website over otas including or if meta search or travel research service limit our participation within their search result it would likely become more difficult and expensive for to generate traffic to our website and therefore to maintain or grow our market share which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation several major hotel company comprising choice hotel international hilton worldwide hyatt intercontinental hotel group wyndham hotel group marriott la quinta and millennium launched room key an online hotel reservation service that competes directly with our hotel reservation service the hotel company that own room key have stated goal of driving consumer directly to their brand website thus reducing the share received by otas they may also attempt to improve their competitive position by offering lower room rate better room availability or additional feature or amenity through room key than are available through service like ours if room key is successful our share of the online hotel room night reservation market could be negatively affected and our business could suffer there ha been proliferation of new channel through which hotel can offer hotel room reservation for example some hotel offer room reservation through daily deal website such groupon and living social which sell coupon to customer at substantial discount in expedia one of our largest competitor entered into partnership with groupon to sell hotel room reservation to groupon customer under the groupon getaway brand name new entrant such backbid guestmob and tingo well hipmunk and room have developed new and differentiated offering that endeavor to provide saving on hotel room to consumer and that compete directly with if any of these new service are successful we may experience le demand for our service and are likely to face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted hotel room rate widespread adoption of mobile device such the iphone android enabled smart phone and tablet such the ipad coupled with the improved web browsing functionality and development of thousand of useful apps available on these device is driving substantial traffic and commerce activity to mobile platform we have experienced significant shift of to mobile platform and our advertising partner are also seeing rapid shift of traffic to mobile platform our major competitor and certain new market entrant are offering mobile application for travel product and other functionality including proprietary last minute discount for hotel booking advertising and distribution opportunity may be more limited on mobile device given their smaller screen size the gross profit earned on mobile transaction may be le than typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing pattern for example hotel reservation made on mobile device typically are for shorter length of stay and are not made far in advance we have made significant progress creating mobile offering which have received strong review solid download trend and are driving material and increasing share of our business we believe that mobile booking present an opportunity for growth and are necessary to maintain and grow our business consumer increasingly turn to mobile device instead of personal computer and to mobile application instead of web browser if we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new and differentiated mobile offering and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platform we could lose market share to existing competitor or new entrant apple inc one of the most successful company in the world and producer of among other thing the iphone and ipad recently obtained patent for itravel mobile app that would allow traveler to check in for travel reservation in addition apple most recent iphone operating system includes passbook virtual wallet app that hold ticket boarding pass coupon and gift card and along with itravel may be indicative of apple intent to enter the travel reservation business in some capacity apple ha substantial market share in the smart phone category and control integration of offering including travel service into it mobile operating system apple also ha more experience producing and developing mobile apps and ha access to greater resource than we have apple may use or expand itravel passbook siri apple voice recognition concierge service or another mobile app mean of entering the travel reservation marketplace similarly google android operating system is the leading smartphone operating system in the world result google could leverage it android operating system to give it travel service competitive advantage either technically or with prominence on it google play app store or within it mobile search result to the extent apple or google use their mobile operating system or app distribution channel to favor their own travel service offering our business could be harmed we use online search engine price comparison and travel research service and affiliate marketing primary mean of generating traffic to our website result our online advertising expense ha increased significantly in recent year trend we expect to continue in addition our online advertising ha grown faster than our gross profit due to brand mix within the priceline group channel mix within our brand and recently lower return on investment roi from our online advertising our international brand are growing faster than our priceline com brand and spend higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising furthermore our brand are generally obtaining an increasing share of traffic through paid online advertising channel finally our online advertising roi have recently been down year over year advertising efficiency is impacted by number of factor that are subject to variability including without limitation adrs cost per click cancellation rate foreign exchange rate and the extent to which we are successful in converting paid traffic to booking customer and then having customer return directly to our website and mobile apps for future booking international trend the size of the travel market outside of the united state is substantially greater than that within the united state historically internet adoption rate and commerce adoption rate of international consumer have trailed those of the united state however international consumer are rapidly moving to online mean for purchasing travel accordingly recent international online travel growth rate have substantially exceeded and are expected to continue to exceed the growth rate within the united state we expect that over the long term international online travel growth rate will follow similar trend to that experienced in the united state in addition the base of hotel property in europe and asia is particularly fragmented compared to that in the united state where the hotel market is dominated by large hotel chain we believe online reservation system like ours may be more appealing to small chain and independent hotel more commonly found outside of the united state our growth ha primarily been generated by our international hotel reservation service brand booking com and agoda com booking com our most significant brand includes over hotel and accommodation on it website of february updated property count are available on the booking com website booking com ha added property over the past year in it core european market well higher growth market such north america which is newer market for booking com asia pacific and south america an increasing amount of our business from both destination and point of sale perspective is conducted in these newer market which are growing faster than our overall growth rate we believe that the opportunity to continue to grow our business exists for the market in which we operate we believe these trend and factor have enabled to become the leading online hotel and accommodation reservation service provider in the world measured by room night booked our international business represents the substantial majority of our result we expect to continue to see our operating expense and other financial metric largely driven by international performance for example certain newer market in which we operate that are in earlier stage of development have lower operating margin compared to more mature which could have negative impact on our overall margin these market increase in size over time also we intend to continue to invest in adding property to our website many of the newer property we add especially in highly penetrated market may have fewer room lower adrs or higher credit risk and may appeal to smaller subset of customer for example hostel and bed and breakfast and therefore may also negatively impact our margin over time another impact of the size of our international business is our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk because we are conducting substantial majority of our business outside the united state and are reporting our result in dollar we face exposure to adverse movement in currency exchange rate the financial result of our international business are translated from local currency principally the euro and the british pound sterling into dollar upon consolidation for example strengthening of the euro increase our euro denominated net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income expressed in dollar while weakening of the euro decrease our euro denominated net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income expressed in dollar greece ireland portugal and certain other european union country with high level of sovereign debt have had difficulty refinancing their debt concern around devaluation or abandonment of the euro common currency or that sovereign default risk may be more widespread and could include the united state ha led to significant volatility in the exchange rate between the euro the dollar and other currency we generally enter into derivative instrument to minimize the impact of short term currency fluctuation on our consolidated operating result however such derivative instrument are short term in nature and not designed to hedge against currency fluctuation that could impact our foreign currency denominated gross booking revenue or gross profit see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information on our derivative contract for example while revenue from our international business grew year over year on local currency basis by approximately for the year ended december compared to the same period in result of the negative impact of currency exchange rate revenue from our international business reported in dollar grew for the year ended december domestic trend competition in domestic online travel remains intense and online travel company are creating new promotion and consumer value feature in an effort to gain competitive advantage in particular the competition to provide opaque hotel reservation service to consumer an area in which our priceline com business ha been leader ha become more intense for example expedia make opaque hotel room reservation available on it principal website under the name expedia unpublished rate and ha supported this initiative with steeper discount through lower margin with our name your own price hotel booking service the name of the hotel is not disclosed until after booking we believe these offering in particular expedia unpublished rate have adversely impacted the market share and year over year growth rate for our opaque hotel service which experienced decline in room night reservation in compared to this decline may have been exacerbated by shift in our advertising in to focus on our non opaque hotel reservation service these and other competitor could also launch opaque rental car service which could negatively impact our opaque name your own price rental car service in addition some hotel offer discounted room reservation through daily deal website such groupon and living social if expedia or others are successful in growing their opaque and semi opaque hotel reservation service and or daily deal website are successful in garnering sizable share of discounted hotel booking we may have le consumer demand for our opaque and semi opaque hotel reservation service over time and we would face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted hotel room rate in an effort to compete more effectively against these new offering in we launched express deal semi opaque price disclosed hotel reservation service however express deal may not be successful at recovering or growing lost hotel reservation service market share result we believe our share of the discount hotel reservation market in the united state could further decrease while demand for online travel service in the united state continues to experience annualized growth we believe that the domestic market share of third party distributor is impacted in part by concerted initiative by travel service provider to direct customer to their own website in an effort to reduce distribution expense and establish more direct control over their pricing the launch of room key discussed above is demonstrative of such effort in addition certain airline have attempted to charge additional fee to customer who book airline reservation through an online channel other than their own website travel service provider who sell on their own website typically do not charge processing fee and in some instance offer advantage such web only fare bonus mile or loyalty point which could make their offering more attractive to consumer than model like ours some travel service provider are encouraging third party travel intermediary such to develop technology to bypass the traditional gd such enabling direct connection to the travel supplier or using alternative global distribution method for example in we enabled direct connection with american airline during american airline content wa temporarily unavailable on expedia and orbitz due to dispute related to enabling direct connection we believe that this is consistent with an effort on the part of american airline and the airline industry in general to reduce distribution cost and could be indicative of the airline in general becoming more aggressive in requiring otas to implement direct connection development and implementation of the technology to enable additional direct connection to travel service could cause to incur additional operating expense increase the frequency duration of system problem and delay other project in addition any additional migration toward direct connection would reduce the compensation we receive from gd domestic airline have reduced capacity and increased fare since the latter part of trend which may continue decrease in capacity reduce the amount of airline ticket available while significant increase in average airfare have adversely impacted leisure travel demand reduced airline capacity and demand negatively impact our priceline com air ticket reservation business which in turn ha negative repercussion on our priceline com hotel and rental car business our rental car business ha also been impacted by an increase in the utilization of rental car fleet resulting in le opaque rental car availability which ha negatively impacted our name your own price rental car service we expect continued variability in the breadth and depth of discounted airline ticket and rental car rate made available to in the future depending on market condition from time to time seasonality meaningful amount of retail gross booking are generated early in the year customer plan and reserve their spring and summer vacation in europe and north america however we generally do not recognize associated revenue until future quarter when the travel occurs from cost perspective we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activity they are incurred which is typically in the quarter in which booking are generated result we typically experience our highest level of profitability in the second and third quarter of the year which is when we experience the highest level of booking and travel consumption for the year for our north american and european business however we experience the highest level of booking and travel consumption for our asia pacific and south american business in the first and fourth quarter therefore if these business continue to grow faster than our north american and european business our operating result for the first and fourth quarter of the year may become more significant over time percentage of full year operating result in addition our name your own price service are generally non refundable in nature and accordingly we recognize travel revenue at the time booking is generated however we recognize revenue generated from our retail hotel service at the time that the customer check out of the hotel therefore if our retail hotel business continues to grow faster than our name our own price service we expect our quarterly result to become increasingly impacted by these seasonal factor other factor we believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to profitably grow our brand worldwide and over time to offer other travel service and further expand into other international market factor beyond our control such worldwide recession higher oil price terrorist attack unusual weather pattern natural disaster such earthquake hurricane tsunami flood volcanic eruption such the april eruption of volcano in iceland travel related health concern including pandemic and epidemic such influenza avian bird flu and sars political instability regional hostility imposition of tax or surcharge by regulatory authority or travel related accident could adversely affect our business and result of operation and impair our ability to effectively implement all or some of the initiative described above for example in late hurricane sandy disrupted travel in the northeastern united state in early japan wa struck by major earthquake tsunami and nuclear emergency in october severe flooding in thailand key market for our agoda com business and the asian business of booking com negatively impacted booking volume and cancellation rate in this market in addition in early thailand experienced disruptive civil unrest which caused the temporary relocation of agoda com thailand based operation future natural disaster or civil or political unrest could further disrupt our business and operation we intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion technology and personnel within parameter consistent with attempt to improve long term operating result even if those expenditure create pressure on operating leverage we have experienced pressure on operating margin we prioritize initiative that drive growth we also intend to broaden the scope of our business and to that end we explore strategic alternative from time to time in the form of among other thing merger and acquisition our goal is to grow gross profit and achieve healthy operating margin in an effort to maintain profitability the uncertain environment described above make the prediction of future result of operation difficult and accordingly we may not be able to sustain gross profit growth and profitability in november we entered into definitive agreement to acquire kayak software corporation leading travel meta search service in stock and cash transaction under the term of the agreement the transaction value kayak at billion billion net of cash acquired or per share of kayak common stock with million to be paid in cash which is expected to be made from cash on hand

the united state of america our significant accounting policy and estimate are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statement certain of our accounting policy and estimate are particularly important to our financial position and result of operation and require to make difficult and subjective judgment often result of the need to make estimate of matter that are inherently uncertain in applying those policy our management us it judgment to determine the appropriate assumption to be used in the determination of certain estimate on an on going basis we evaluate our estimate including those related to the item described below those estimate are based on among other thing historical experience term of existing contract our observance of trend in the travel industry and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance our actual result may differ from these estimate under different assumption or condition our significant accounting policy that involve significant estimate and judgment of management include the following accounting for state and local hotel occupancy tax discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement we are currently involved in approximately forty lawsuit brought by or against state city and county over issue involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other related tax state and local sale tax and general excise tax and our merchant hotel business we are also involved in one consumer lawsuit relating to among other thing the payment of hotel occupancy tax and service fee in addition over seventy municipality or county and at least eight state have initiated audit proceeding including proceeding initiated by more than forty municipality in california issued proposed tax assessment or started inquiry relating to the payment of hotel occupancy and other related tax additional state and local jurisdiction are likely to assert that we are subject to among other thing hotel occupancy and other related tax and could seek to collect such tax retroactively and or prospectively historically we have not collected hotel occupancy or other tax on the gross profit earned from merchant hotel transaction however in handful of jurisdiction we have been recently required by passage of new statute or court order to start collecting and remitting certain tax local occupancy and or sale or excise tax imposed upon our margin and or service fee the ultimate resolution of these matter in all jurisdiction can not be determined at this time we have established an accrual for potential resolution of issue related to hotel occupancy and other related tax for prior and current period consistent with applicable accounting principle and in light of all current fact and circumstance we accrue for legal contingency where it is probable that loss ha occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated our legal expense for these matter are expensed incurred and are not reflected in the amount accrued variety of factor could affect the amount of the liability both past and future which factor include but are not limited to the number of and amount of gross profit represented by jurisdiction that ultimately assert claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate settlement and change in relevant statute the ultimate resolution of these matter may be greater or le than the liability recorded stock based compensation we record stock based compensation expense for equity based award over the recipient service period based upon the grant date fair value of the award number of our equity award have performance target performance contingency which if satisfied can increase the number of share issued to the recipient at the end of the performance period or in certain instance if not satisfied reduce the number of share issued to the recipient sometimes to zero at the end of the performance period the performance period for our performance based equity award are typically three year we record stock based compensation expense for these performance based award based upon our estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the performance period the estimated performance against the performance target we periodically adjust the cumulative stock based compensation recorded when the probable outcome for these performance based award is updated based upon change in actual and forecasted operating result stock based compensation for the year ended december and includes charge amounting to million million and million respectively representing the cumulative impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome of unvested performance share unit our actual performance against the performance target could differ materially from our estimate we record stock based compensation expense net of estimated forfeiture in determining the estimated forfeiture rate we periodically review actual and projected forfeiture to the extent that actual or projected forfeiture rate differ from current estimate such amount are recorded cumulative adjustment in the period in which the estimate is revised valuation of goodwill we have recorded goodwill related to business we have acquired goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment using appropriate valuation technique in the event that future circumstance indicate that any portion of our goodwill is impaired an impairment charge would be recorded substantial amount of our goodwill relates to our acquisition of booking com the estimated fair value for booking com well our other reporting unit is substantially in excess of their respective carrying value since the annual impairment test in september there have been no event or change in circumstance to indicate potential impairment valuation of long lived asset and intangible we evaluate whether event or circumstance have occurred which indicate that the carrying amount of long lived asset and intangible may be impaired the significant factor that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include change in business strategy market condition or the manner of use of an asset under performance relative to historical or expected future operating result and negative industry or economic trend in evaluating an asset for possible impairment management estimate that asset future undiscounted cash flow to measure whether the carrying value of the asset is recoverable if it is determined that the asset is not recoverable we measure the impairment based upon the fair value of the asset compared to it carrying value the fair value represents the projected discounted cash flow of the asset over it remaining life deferred tax valuation allowance we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax asset and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax asset by valuation allowance to the extent we believe portion will not be realized we consider many factor when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax asset including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction expectation of future income the carryforward period available to for tax reporting purpose and other relevant factor the deferred tax asset at december amounted to million the valuation allowance may need to be adjusted in the future if fact and circumstance change causing reassessment of the amount of deferred tax asset more likely than not to be realized recent accounting pronouncementson january we adopted the amended accounting guidance issued by the financial accounting standard board fasb concerning the presentation of comprehensive income the new guidance requires comprehensive income to be reported in either single statement or in two consecutive statement reporting net income and other comprehensive income we selected to present two consecutive statement this amended guidance did not change the item that constitute net income or other comprehensive income the timing of when other comprehensive income is reclassified to net income or the earnings per share computation in february the fasb

period beginning after december we will comply with the new disclosure requirement beginning in the first quarter of in september the fasb issued an accounting update which amended the guidance on testing goodwill for impairment under the revised guidance entity testing goodwill for impairment have the option of performing qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit if based on the qualitative factor it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is le than it carrying value then the unchanged two step approach previously used would be required the new accounting guidance did not change goodwill is calculated how goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or the requirement for testing goodwill annually or when event and circumstance warrant testing the accounting update wa effective for annual and interim period beginning after december with early adoption permitted in september we performed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment testing and concluded that the estimated fair value for each reporting unit substantially exceeds it respective carrying value in may the fasb issued amended guidance on fair value to largely achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirement between gaap and ifrs the new accounting guidance did not extend the use of fair value but rather provided guidance about how fair value should be determined for gaap most of the change were clarification of existing guidance or wording change to align with ifrs the amended guidance expanded disclosure particularly relating to fair value measurement based on unobservable input permitted fair value measurement for financial asset and liability on net position if market or credit risk are managed on net basis and other criterion are met and allowed premium and discount only if market participant would also include them in the fair value measurement this accounting wa effective for public company for interim or annual period beginning after december with early adoption permitted the adoption of this accounting guidance effective with the three month ended march did not impact our consolidated financial

reported at the net amount received without any associated cost of revenue principally all of the revenue for booking com is comprised of travel commission merchant revenue are derived from service

for credit card chargebacks and provision for bad debt primarily related to agency hotel commission receivables for the year ended december sale and marketing expense which are substantially variable in nature increased over the same period in primarily due to increased gross booking volume well expense related to increased content translation the increase wa partially offset by reduced credit card processing fee resulting from the durbin amendment to the dodd frank financial reform and consumer protection act which amendment cap the interchange fee for debit card transaction and went into

changeincome tax expense our effective tax rate for the year ended december and were and respectively the decrease in our effective tax rate is primarily due to an increase in the innovation box tax benefit in our effective tax rate differs from the expected tax provision at the statutory tax rate of principally due to lower foreign tax rate partially offset by state income tax and certain non deductible expense effective january the netherlands modified it corporate income tax law related to income generated from qualifying innovative activity the innovation box tax earnings that qualify for the innovation box tax are taxed at the rate of rather than the dutch statutory rate of booking com obtained ruling from the dutch tax authority in february confirming that portion of it earnings qualifying earnings is eligible for innovation box tax treatment in this ruling the dutch tax authority require that the innovation box tax benefit be phased in over multi year period the benefit is fully phased in for the company starting in the amount of qualifying earnings expressed percentage of the total pretax earnings in the netherlands will vary depending upon the level of total pretax earnings that is achieved in any given year the ruling from the dutch tax authority is valid from january through december which includes one year extension granted by the dutch tax authority in

eliminated booking com intends to apply for continued innovation box tax treatment for future period booking com application may not be accepted or if accepted the amount of qualifying earnings may be reduced or the applicable tax rate on qualifying earnings may be higher than the current rate at that time in addition the tax law may change resulting in reduction or elimination of the tax benefit until our net operating loss carryforwards are utilized or expire we do not expect to make tax payment on our income except for federal alternative minimum tax and state income tax however we expect to pay foreign tax on our foreign income we expect that our international operation will grow their pretax income at higher rate than the business over the long term and therefore it is our expectation that our cash tax payment will increase our international business generate an increasing share of our pre tax income the internal revenue service initiated an audit of our and federal

and assumed stock option subject to volume weighted average trading price calculation and collar on the value of our common stock the transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of pending approval from relevant regulatory authority and kayak shareholder contingenciesa number of jurisdiction in the united state have initiated lawsuit against online travel company including related to among other thing the payment of hotel occupancy and other related tax state and local sale tax and general excise tax in addition number of state county and municipality have initiated audit proceeding issued proposed tax assessment or started inquiry relating to the payment of hotel occupancy and other related tax to date the majority of taxing jurisdiction in which we facilitate the making of hotel room reservation have not asserted that tax are due and payable on our merchant hotel business with respect to jurisdiction that have not initiated proceeding to date it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statute and seek to collect tax from only on prospective basis see item legal proceeding and note to the consolidated financial statement for description of these pending case and proceeding and item risk factor adverse application of state and local tax law could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation we are vigorously defending against these claim and proceeding however litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse development in these pending or future case and proceeding an unfavorable outcome or settlement of these action or proceeding could result in substantial liability for past and or future booking including among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation or cash flow in any given operating period also there have been and will continue to be ongoing cost associated with defending our position in pending and any future case or proceeding to the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that we have tax collection responsibility or we determine that we have such responsibility with respect to future transaction we may collect any such additional tax obligation from our customer which would have the effect of increasing the cost of hotel reservation to our customer and consequently could make our hotel reservation service le competitive versus the website of other online travel company or hotel company website and reduce hotel reservation transaction alternatively we could choose to reduce the compensation for our service on merchant hotel transaction either action could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation result of this litigation and other attempt by jurisdiction to levy similar tax we have established an accrual which amounted to approximately million and million of december and respectively the accrual is based on our estimate of the probable cost of resolving these issue the actual cost may be le or greater potentially significantly than the liability recorded we believe that even if we were to suffer adverse determination in the near term in more of the pending proceeding than currently anticipated given result to date because of our available cash it would not have material impact on our liquidity the following table represents our material contractual obligation and commitment of december see note to the consolidated financial statement payment due by period in thousand contractual obligation total le year to to year more than yearsoperating lease obligation debt credit facility redeemable noncontrolling interest total convertible debt represents the aggregate principal amount of the note and interest of million convertible debt doe not reflect the market value in excess of the outstanding principal amount because we can settle the conversion premium amount in cash or share of common stock at our option see note to the consolidated financial statement represents fee on uncommitted fund and outstanding letter of credit of december we reported other long term liability of million on the consolidated balance sheet at december of which approximately million related to our accrual for potential resolution of issue related to hotel occupancy and other related tax refer to note to the consolidated financial statement and approximately million related to unrecognized tax benefit refer to note to the consolidated financial statement variety of factor could affect the timing of payment for these liability we believe that these matter will likely not be resolved in the next twelve month and accordingly we have classified the estimated liability non current on the consolidated balance sheet we have excluded other long term liability in the amount of million from the contractual obligation table because we can not reasonably estimate the timing of such payment since the contingent conversion threshold for the convertible senior note due wa exceeded of december these note are convertible at the option of the holder if the holder elect to convert we will be required to pay the aggregate principal amount in cash and we will deliver cash or share of common stock at our option for the conversion value in excess of the aggregate principal amount we would likely fund our conversion obligation with cash and cash equivalent short term investment and borrowing under our revolving credit facility we believe that our existing cash balance and liquid resource will be sufficient to fund our operating activity capital expenditure and other obligation through at least the next twelve month however if during that period or thereafter we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operation or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amount and on term acceptable to we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditure and scale back the scope of our business plan either of which could have material adverse effect on our future financial condition or result of operation if additional fund were raised through the issuance of equity security the percentage ownership of our then current stockholder would be diluted we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operation in the future revenue growth or sustained profitability may not be realized and future borrowing or equity sale may not be available in amount sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditure finance our strategy or repay our indebtedness off balance sheet arrangement of december we did not have any off balance sheet arrangement that have or are reasonably likely to have current or future effect on our financial condition result of operation liquidity capital expenditure or capital resource item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policy and procedure and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instrument we use foreign exchange derivative contract to manage short term foreign currency risk the objective of our policy is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and fair value exposure resulting from possible future adverse fluctuation in rate we evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near and long term fluctuation in interest rate and foreign exchange rate this evaluation includes the review of leading market indicator discussion with financial analyst and investment banker regarding current and future economic condition and the review of market projection to expected future rate we utilize this information to determine our own investment strategy well to determine if the use of derivative financial instrument is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face our policy doe not allow speculation in derivative instrument for profit or execution of derivative instrument contract for which there are no underlying exposure we do not use financial instrument for trading purpose and are not party to any leveraged derivative to the extent that change in interest rate and currency exchange rate affect general economic condition we would also be affected by such change we did not experience any material change in interest rate exposure during the year ended december based upon economic condition and leading market indicator at december we do not foresee significant adverse change in interest rate in the near future fixed rate investment are subject to unrealized gain and loss due to interest rate volatility we performed sensitivity analysis to determine the impact change in interest rate would have on the fair value of our available for sale investment assuming an adverse change of basis point hypothetical basis point increase in interest rate would have resulted in decrease in the fair value of our investment of december of approximately million these hypothetical loss would only be realized if we sold the investment prior to their maturity of december the outstanding principal amount of our debt is billion we estimate that the market value of such debt wa approximately billion of december substantial portion of the market value of our debt in excess of the outstanding principal amount is related to the conversion premium on our outstanding convertible bond result of the growth of booking com agoda com and rentalcars com we are conducting significant portion of our business outside the united state through subsidiary with functional currency other than the dollar primarily euro result we face exposure to adverse movement in currency exchange rate the financial result of our international operation are translated from local currency into dollar upon consolidation if the dollar weakens against the local currency the translation of these foreign currency denominated balance will result in increased net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income similarly our net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income will decrease if the dollar strengthens against the local currency additionally foreign exchange rate fluctuation on transaction denominated in currency other than the functional currency result in gain and loss that are reflected in the consolidated statement of operation booking com agoda com and rentalcars com are subject to risk typical of international business including differing economic condition change in political climate differing tax structure other regulation and restriction and foreign exchange rate volatility from time to time we enter into foreign exchange derivative contract to minimize the impact of short term foreign currency fluctuation on our consolidated operating result our derivative contract principally address foreign exchange fluctuation risk for the euro and the british pound sterling of december and there were no such outstanding derivative contract foreign exchange gain of million million and million for the year ended december and respectively were recorded in foreign currency transaction and other in the consolidated statement of operation of december and we had outstanding forward currency contract with notional value of billion euro and million euro respectively that are designated hedge of our net investment in foreign subsidiary for accounting purpose these contract are all short term in nature mark to market adjustment on these net investment hedge are recorded currency translation adjustment the fair value of these derivative at december wa liability of million with million recorded in accrued expense and other current liability and million recorded in prepaid and other current asset on the consolidated balance sheet the fair value of these derivative at december wa an asset of million and wa recorded in prepaid expense and other current asset on the consolidated balance sheet hypothetical strengthening of the foreign exchange rate relative to the dollar with all other variable held constant would have resulted in derivative liability of approximately million of december

but not all of these case generally each complaint alleges among other thing that the defendant violated each jurisdiction respective hotel occupancy tax ordinance with respect to the charge and remittance of amount to cover tax under each law each complaint typically seek compensatory damage disgorgement penalty available by law attorney fee and other relief the company is also involved in one consumer lawsuit relating to among other thing the payment of hotel occupancy tax and service fee in addition approximately seventy municipality or county and at least twelve state have initiated audit proceeding including proceeding initiated by more than forty municipality in california issued proposed tax assessment or started inquiry relating to the payment of hotel occupancy and other related tax additional state and local jurisdiction are likely to assert that the company is subject to among other thing hotel occupancy and other related tax and could seek to collect such tax retroactively and or prospectively with respect to the principal claim in these matter the company belief that the law at issue do not apply to the service it provides namely the facilitation of reservation and therefore that it doe not owe the tax that are claimed to be owed rather the company belief that the law at issue generally impose hotel occupancy and other related tax on entity that own operate or control hotel or similar business or furnish or provide hotel room or similar accommodation in addition in many of these matter the taxing jurisdiction have asserted claim for conversion essentially that the company ha collected tax and wrongfully pocketed those tax dollar claim that the company belief is without basis and ha vigorously contested the taxing jurisdiction that are currently involved in litigation and other proceeding with the company and that may be involved in future proceeding have asserted contrary position and will likely continue to do so time to time the company ha found it expedient to settle and may in the future agree to settle claim pending in these matter without conceding that the claim at issue are meritorious or that the claimed tax are in fact due to be paid in connection with some of these tax audit and assessment the company may be required to pay any assessed tax which amount may be substantial prior to being allowed to contest the assessment and the applicability of the law in judicial proceeding this requirement is commonly referred to pay to play or pay first the company ha successfully argued against pay first requirement asserted in one california proceeding but had to pay first in two california city for example the city of san francisco assessed the company approximately million an amount that includes interest and penalty relating to hotel occupancy tax which the company paid in july and issued second assessment totaling approximately million which the company paid in january payment of these amount if any is not an admission that the company belief it is subject to such tax and even if such payment are made the company intends to continue to assert it position vigorously that it should not be subject to such tax in the san francisco action for example the court ruled on february that the company and otcs do not owe transient accommodation tax to the city and ordered the city to refund the pay first amount paid in july the company will also seek refund of the amount paid first in january it is possible the city may take the position that it need not refund the pay first amount until after it ha exhausted all appeal in january the tax appeal court for the state of hawaii held that the company and other otcs are not liable for the state transient accommodation tax but held that the otcs including the company are liable for the state general excise tax on the full amount the otc collect from the customer for hotel room reservation without any offset for amount passed through to the hotel result the company increased it accrual for hotel occupancy and other related tax with corresponding charge to cost of revenue by approximately million including estimated interest and penalty in december further the company may be required to pay that amount prior to appealing the tax appeal court decision the company intends to appeal this decision litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse development in these pending or future case and proceeding for example in september the superior court in the district of columbia granted summary judgment in favor of the city and against otcs ruling that tax is due on the otc margin and service fee result the company increased it accrual for hotel occupancy and other related tax with corresponding charge to cost of revenue by approximately million including interest in addition in october jury in san antonio class action found that the company and the other otcs that are defendant in the lawsuit control hotel for purpose of the local hotel occupancy tax ordinance at issue and are therefore subject to the requirement of those ordinance on july the san antonio court issued finding of fact and conclusion of law in connection with the case in addition to ruling that hotel tax wa due from defendant on the markup and service fee the court held defendant liable for penalty and interest per the term of each city applicable ordinance but capped penalty at fifteen percent of the total amount of unpaid tax at the time of entry of judgment ordinance without penalty provision are assessed fifteen percent penalty under the texas tax code the company expects judgment to be entered by the court the company intends to vigorously pursue an appeal of the judgment on legal and factual ground an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation may encourage the commencement of additional litigation audit proceeding or other regulatory inquiry in addition an unfavorable outcome or settlement of these action or proceeding could result in substantial liability for past and or future booking including among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost there have been and will continue to be substantial ongoing cost which may include pay first payment associated with defending the company position in pending and any future case or proceeding an adverse outcome in one or more of these unresolved proceeding could have material adverse effect on the company business and could be material to the company result of operation or cash flow in any given operating period to the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that the company ha tax collection responsibility or the company determines that it ha such responsibility with respect to future transaction the company may collect any such additional tax obligation from it customer which would have the effect of increasing the cost of hotel reservation to it customer and consequently could make the company hotel reservation service le competitive versus the website of other otcs or hotel company website and reduce hotel reservation transaction alternatively the company could choose to reduce the compensation for it service on merchant hotel transaction either action could have material adverse effect on the company business and result of operation the company estimate that since it inception through december it ha earned aggregate gross profit including fee from it entire merchant hotel business which includes among other thing the differential between the price paid by customer for the company service and the cost of the underlying room of approximately billion this gross profit wa earned in over thousand taxing jurisdiction that the company belief have aggregate tax rate which may hotel occupancy tax and state and local tax among other tax associated with typical transaction between consumer and hotel that generally range from approximately to approximately depending on the jurisdiction in many of the judicial and other proceeding initiated to date the taxing jurisdiction seek not only historical tax that are claimed to be owed on the company gross profit but also among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost therefore any liability associated with hotel occupancy tax matter is not constrained to the company liability for tax owed on it historical gross profit but may also include among other thing penalty interest and attorney fee to date the majority of the taxing jurisdiction in which the company facilitates hotel reservation have not asserted that tax are due and payable on the company merchant hotel business with respect to taxing jurisdiction that have not initiated proceeding to date it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statute and seek to collect tax from the company only on prospective basis reserve for hotel occupancy and other related tax result of this litigation and other attempt by jurisdiction to levy similar tax the company ha established an accrual for the potential
