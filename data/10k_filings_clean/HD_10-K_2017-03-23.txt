competition could adversely affect price and demand for our product and service and could decrease our market share we operate in market that are highly competitive we compete principally based on customer experience price store location and appearance and quality availability assortment and presentation of merchandise in each market we serve there are number of other home improvement store electrical plumbing and building material supply house and lumber yard with respect to some product and service we also compete with specialty design store showroom discount store local regional and national hardware store paint store mail order firm warehouse club independent building supply store mro company and other retailer well with provider of home improvement service in addition we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailer some of whom may have lower cost structure than ours our customer now routinely use computer tablet smartphones and other mobile device to shop online and compare price and product in real time we use our marketing advertising and promotional program to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively and we must regularly ass and adjust our effort to address change in the competitive landscape intense competitive pressure from one or more of our competitor such through aggressive promotional pricing or liquidation event or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to changing competitive landscape could affect our price our of contentsmargins or demand for our product and service if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressure including through the delivery of superior customer experience or maintenance of effective marketing advertising or promotional program our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer need expectation or trend which could adversely affect our relationship with customer our reputation the demand for our product and service and our market share the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trend in demographic consumer preference expectation and need and unexpected weather condition while also managing appropriate inventory level and maintaining an excellent customer experience it is difficult to successfully predict the product and service our customer will demand we continue to see increasing strength in the housing and home improvement market resulting change in demand will put further pressure on our ability to meet customer need and expectation and maintain high service level in addition each of our primary customer group diy difm and pro have different need and expectation many of which evolve the demographic in particular customer group change we also need to offer more localized assortment of our merchandise to appeal to local cultural and demographic taste within each customer group if we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual need and expectation of or within customer group we may lose market share with respect to those customer customer expectation about the method by which they purchase and receive product or service are also becoming more demanding customer now routinely use technology and mobile device to rapidly compare product and price determine real time product availability and purchase product product are purchased customer are seeking alternate option for delivery of those product and they often expect quick and low cost delivery we must continually anticipate and adapt to these change in the purchasing process we have implemented program like bos bopis bodfs and direct fulfillment but we can not guarantee that these program or others we may implement will be implemented successfully or will meet customer need and expectation customer are also using social medium to provide feedback and information about our company and product and service in manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated to the extent customer ha negative experience and share it over social medium it may impact our brand and reputation further we have an aging store base that requires maintenance and space reallocation initiative to deliver the shopping experience that our customer desire we must also maintain safe store environment for our customer and associate failure to maintain our store and utilize our store space effectively to provide compelling online presence to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preference expectation and home improvement need to provide quick and low cost delivery alternative to differentiate the customer experience for our three primary customer group and to effectively implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment could adversely affect our relationship with customer our reputation the demand for our product and service and our market share our success depends upon our ability to attract develop and retain highly qualified associate while also controlling our labor cost our customer expect high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associate to meet the need and expectation of our customer we must attract develop and retain large number of highly qualified associate while at the same time controlling labor cost our ability to control labor cost is subject to numerous external factor including prevailing wage rate and health and other insurance cost well the impact of legislation or regulation governing labor relation minimum wage or healthcare benefit an inability to provide wage and or benefit that are competitive within the market in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract employee in addition we compete with other retail business for many of our associate in hourly position and we invest significant resource in training and motivating them to maintain high level of job satisfaction these position have historically had high turnover rate which can lead to increased training and retention cost particularly the economy continues to improve and the labor market tightens there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associate in the future failure of key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business we rely extensively on information technology system some of which are managed or provided by third party service provider to analyze process store manage and protect transaction and data in managing our business we also rely heavily on the integrity of security of and consistent access to this data for information such sale merchandise ordering inventory replenishment and order fulfillment for these information technology system and process to operate effectively we or our service provider must periodically maintain and update them our system and the third party system on which we rely are subject to damage or interruption from number of cause including power outage computer and telecommunication failure computer

of service in key portion of our information technology infrastructure which could significantly disrupt our operation and be costly time consuming and resource intensive to remedy disruption in our

business and negatively affect our relationship with our customer if our effort to maintain the privacy and security of customer associate supplier and company information are not successful we could incur substantial additional cost and reputational damage and could become subject to further litigation and enforcement action our business like that of most retailer involves the receipt storage and

subject to payment related risk that could increase our operating cost expose to fraud or theft subject to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business we accept payment using variety of
