shifting volume level and the timing and amount of fluctuation in fuel price and our ability to recover incremental fuel cost through our fuel surcharge the majority of our operating expense are directly impacted by revenue and volume level accordingly we expect these operating expense to fluctuate on year over year basis consistent with change in revenue and volume therefore the discussion

corridor by amortizing them into operating result over the average future service period of active employee in these plan we have elected to immediately recognize actuarial gain and loss in our consolidated operating result in the year in which the gain and loss occur this change will provide greater transparency into operating result by more quickly recognizing the effect of economic and interest rate condition on plan obligation investment and assumption the actuarial gain and loss are measured annually of may and accordingly are recorded during the fourth quarter in addition for purpose of calculating the expected return on plan asset we will no longer use an averaging technique permitted under accounting principle generally accepted in the united state for the market related

however operating margin benefited from revenue growth our profit improvement program which we commenced in the net impact of fuel further described below and lower year over year impact from severe winter weather operating expense included an increase in salary and employee benefit expense of in due to the timing of merit increase for many of our employee at fedex express additional staffing to

higher utilization of third party transportation provider at fedex freight and the expansion of our freight forwarding business at fedex trade network table of content depreciation and amortization expense increased in primarily due to accelerated depreciation on certain aircraft scheduled for retirement and aircraft placed in service at fedex express million salary and employee benefit expense in increased due to the benefit from our voluntary employee buyout program lower pension expense the delayed timing or absence of merit increase for many of our employee and reduced variable incentive compensation maintenance and repair decreased in due to network adjustment at fedex express and the continued modernization of our aircraft fleet which impacted the timing of certain maintenance event fuel the following graph for our transportation segment show our average cost of jet and vehicle fuel per gallon for the year ended may fuel expense decreased during primarily due to lower aircraft fuel price however fuel price represent only one component of the two factor we consider meaningful in understanding the impact of fuel on our business consideration must also be given to the fuel surcharge revenue we collect accordingly we believe discussion of the net impact of fuel on our result which is comparison of the year over year change in these two factor is important to understand the impact of fuel on our business in order to provide information about the impact of fuel surcharge on the trend in revenue and yield growth we have included the comparative weighted average fuel surcharge percentage in effect for and in the accompanying discussion of each of our transportation segment the index used to determine the fuel surcharge percentage for our fedex freight business adjusts weekly while our fuel surcharge for the fedex express and fedex ground business incorporate timing lag of approximately six to eight week before they are adjusted for change in fuel price for example the fuel surcharge index in effect at fedex express in may wa set based on march fuel price in addition the structure of the table that is used to determine our fuel surcharge at fedex express and fedex ground doe not adjust immediately for change in fuel price but allows for the fuel surcharge revenue charged to our customer to remain unchanged long fuel price remain within certain range beyond these factor the manner in which we purchase fuel also influence the net impact of fuel on our result for example our contract for jet fuel purchase at fedex express are tied to various index including the gulf coast index while many of these index are aligned each index may fluctuate at different pace driving variability in the price paid for jet fuel furthermore under these contractual arrangement approximately of our jet fuel is purchased based on the index price for the preceding week with the remainder of our purchase tied to the index price for the preceding month rather than based on daily spot rate these contractual provision mitigate the impact of rapidly changing daily spot rate on our jet fuel purchase table of content because of the factor described above our operating result may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by significant amount or change by amount that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharge which can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short term we routinely review our fuel surcharge and our fuel surcharge methodology on february we updated the table used to determine our fuel surcharge at fedex express fedex ground and fedex freight the net impact of fuel had significant benefit to operating income in this wa driven by decreased fuel price during versus the prior year which wa partially offset by the year over year decrease in fuel surcharge revenue during these period the net impact of fuel on our operating result doe not consider the effect that fuel surcharge level may have on our business including change in demand and shift in the mix of service purchased by our customer while fluctuation in fuel surcharge percentage can be significant from period to period fuel surcharge represent one of the many individual component of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield additional component include the mix of service sold the base price and extra service charge we obtain for these service and the level of pricing discount offered fuel expense decreased during primarily due to lower average price per gallon of jet fuel and lower aircraft fuel usage the net impact of fuel had significant negative impact on operating income in this wa driven by decreased fuel surcharge revenue during versus prior year which wa slightly offset by the year over year decrease in fuel price interest expense interest expense increased million in primarily due to increased interest expense from our january debt offering and debt issuance interest expense increased million in primarily due to increased interest expense from our january debt offering debt issuance and reduction in capitalized interest income tax our effective tax rate wa in in and in due to it effect on income before income tax the adoption of mtm accounting reduced our effective tax rate by basis point and increased our effective tax rate by basis point in and basis point in our permanent reinvestment strategy with respect to unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiary provided benefit of approximately million to our provision for income tax our cumulative permanently reinvested foreign earnings were billion at the end of and billion at the end of for we expect our effective tax rate to be between and prior to any year end mtm adjustment the actual rate however will depend on number of factor including the amount and source of operating income and the impact of the mtm adjustment additional information on income tax including our effective tax rate reconciliation liability for uncertain tax position and our global tax profile can be found in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement business acquisition on april we entered into conditional agreement to acquire tnt express tnt express for billion currently approximately billion this combination is expected to expand our global portfolio particularly in europe lower our cost to serve our european market by increasing density in our pickup and delivery operation and accelerate our global growth this acquisition is expected to be completed in the first half of calendar year the closing of the acquisition is subject to customary condition including obtaining all necessary approval and competition clearance we expect to secure all relevant competition approval table of content during we acquired two business expanding our portfolio in commerce and supply chain solution on january we acquired genco leading north american third party logistics provider for billion which wa funded using portion of the proceeds from our january debt issuance the financial result of this business are included in the fedex ground segment from the date of

information ha not been presented profit improvement program during we announced profit improvement program primarily through initiative at fedex express and fedex service targeting annual profitability improvement of billion at fedex express our plan position fedex express to exit with run rate of billion in additional operating profit from the then base business our ability to achieve the profit improvement target and other benefit from these program is dependent upon number of factor including the health of the global economy and future customer demand in we made substantial progress in achieving our profit improvement goal fedex express ha improved operating income by approximately from with essentially flat revenue during the three year period fedex service ha reduced it total expense while investing in major information technology transformation project in addition our incentive compensation program have been gradually reinstated so that business plan objective represent more fully funded compensation target during we completed program to offer voluntary cash buyout to eligible based employee in certain staff function result of this program approximately employee left the company we recognized cost of million million net of tax or per diluted share during which were related primarily to severance when eligible employee accepted their offer payment under this program were made at the time of departure and totaled approximately million in and million in the cost of the program is included in the caption business realignment impairment and other charge in our consolidated statement of income also included in that caption are other external cost directly attributable to our business realignment activity such professional fee see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement for further discussion of the voluntary employee severance program in addition see the long lived asset section of our critical accounting estimate for discussion of fleet modernization action taken in and table of content outlook we anticipate revenue and earnings growth in prior to any year end mtm adjustment driven by continued improvement in the performance of all of our transportation segment including the continued execution of the profit improvement program noted above we expect continued moderate global economic growth to drive volume and yield improvement our expectation for earnings growth in are dependent on key external factor including fuel price and global economic condition our outlook for doe not contemplate any impact from our announced intent to acquire tnt express such integration planning or transaction cost or the operating activity of tnt express if the transaction is consummated our capital expenditure for are expected to approximate billion for continued expansion of the fedex ground network and additional aircraft delivery in to support our fleet modernization program at fedex express we will continue to evaluate our investment in critical long term strategic project to ensure our capital expenditure generate high return on investment and are balanced with our outlook for global economic condition for additional detail on key capital project refer to the capital resource and liquidity outlook section of this md our outlook is dependent upon stable pricing environment for fuel volatility in fuel price impact our fuel surcharge level fuel expense and demand for our service volatility in fuel cost may impact earnings because adjustment to our fuel surcharge lag change in actual fuel price paid therefore the trailing impact of adjustment to our fuel surcharge can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short term described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement we are involved in number of lawsuit and other proceeding that challenge the status of fedex ground owner operator independent contractor fedex ground anticipates continuing change to it relationship with it owner operator previously announced fedex ground reached an agreement which is subject to court approval to settle an independent contractor case in california and we accrued related charge in the fourth quarter of additionally during the first quarter of we established an accrual for the estimated probable loss in the oregon case that wa required to be recognized pursuant to applicable accounting standard with respect to the matter that are pending outside of california and oregon the nature timing and amount of any change are dependent on the outcome of numerous future event we can not reasonably estimate the potential impact of any such change or meaningful range of potential outcome although they could be material however we do not believe that any such change will impair our ability to operate and profitably grow our fedex ground business see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement for additional information see risk factor for discussion of these and other potential risk and uncertainty that could materially affect our future performance seasonality of business our business are cyclical in nature seasonal fluctuation affect volume revenue and earnings historically the express package business experience an increase in volume in late november and december international business particularly in the asia to market peak in october and november in advance of the holiday sale season our first and third fiscal quarter because they are summer vacation and post winter holiday season have historically experienced lower volume relative to other period normally the fall is the busiest shipping period for fedex ground while late december june and july are the slowest period for fedex freight the spring and fall are the busiest period and the latter part of december through february is the slowest period for fedex office the summer month are normally the slowest period shipment level operating cost and earnings for each of our company can also be adversely affected by inclement weather particularly the impact of severe winter weather in our third fiscal quarter table of content recent accounting guidance new accounting rule and disclosure requirement can significantly impact our reported result and the comparability of our financial statement on june we adopted the authoritative guidance issued by the financial accounting standard board fasb requiring additional information about reclassification adjustment out of accumulated other comprehensive income including change in accumulated other comprehensive income balance by component and significant item reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income we have adopted this guidance by including expanded accumulated other comprehensive income disclosure requirement in note of our consolidated financial statement on may the fasb and international accounting standard board issued new accounting standard that will supersede virtually all existing revenue recognition guidance under accounting principle generally accepted in the united state and international financial reporting standard which ha been subsequently updated to defer the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year this standard will be effective for beginning in fiscal the fundamental principle of the new guidance are that company should recognize revenue in manner that reflects the timing of the transfer of service to customer and the amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that

calculated value method to determine the value of plan asset amortizing change in the fair value of plan asset over period no table of content longer than four year under our new mtm accounting methodology described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement we will immediately recognize change in the fair value of plan asset and actuarial gain or loss in our operating result annually in the fourth quarter each year the remaining component of pension and postretirement healthcare expense primarily service and interest cost and the expected return on plan asset will continue to be recorded on quarterly basis we elected to adopt mtm accounting for number of reason immediate recognition of gain and loss in the income statement is the preferred method of accounting for these plan it aligns the income statement treatment with the treatment required to measure the related asset and liability in the balance sheet furthermore the accumulated actuarial loss relate primarily to the remeasurement of our legacy pension formula which ha been frozen for the vast majority of employee since due to persistently low interest rate and demographic assumption change those accumulated loss have become increasingly material and amortizing them into future period would punitively burden future operation for legacy benefit cost we are required to record year end adjustment to our financial statement on an annual basis for the net funded status of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan the funded status of our plan also impact our liquidity however the cash funding rule operate under completely different set of assumption and standard than those used for financial reporting purpose result our actual cash funding requirement can differ materially from our reported funded status the salary and employee benefit caption of our consolidated income statement includes expense associated with service and interest cost and the expected return on plan asset our fourth quarter mtm adjustment is included in the retirement plan mark to market adjustment caption in our consolidated income statement summary of our retirement plan cost over the past three year is follows in million defined benefit pension plan segment level corporate elimination and other total defined benefit pension plan defined contribution plan postretirement healthcare plan retirement plan mark to market adjustment the component of the pre tax mark to market loss gain are follows in million discount rate change actual versus expected return on asset demographic assumption change total mark to market loss gain the implementation of new mortality table in resulted in an increased participant life expectancy assumption which increased the overall projected benefit obligation by billion the weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan declined from at may to at may the actual rate of return on our pension plan asset of exceeded our expected return of primarily due to favorable investment environment for global equity market the weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan decreased from at may to at may table of content the weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan increased from at may to at may the actual rate of return on our pension plan asset of exceeded our expected return of primarily due to favorable investment environment for global equity and credit market following is discussion of the key estimate we consider in determining our pension plan cost discount rate this is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payment that have been accrued to date the projected benefit obligation or pbo to their net present value and to determine the succeeding year ongoing pension expense prior to any year end mtm adjustment the discount rate is determined each year at the plan measurement date the discount rate at each measurement date is follows measurement date discount rate we determine the discount rate with the assistance of actuary who calculate the yield on theoretical portfolio of high grade corporate bond rated aa or better in developing this theoretical portfolio we select bond that match cash flow to benefit payment limit our concentration by industry and issuer and apply screening criterion to ensure bond with call feature have low probability of being called to the extent scheduled bond proceeds exceed the estimated benefit payment in given period the calculation assumes those excess proceeds are reinvested at one year forward rate the discount rate assumption is highly sensitive for our largest pension plan at our may measurement date basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased our pbo by approximately billion and basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased our pbo by approximately billion with the adoption of mtm accounting the impact of change in the discount rate on pension expense are predominately isolated to our fourth quarter mark to market adjustment one basis point change in the discount rate for our largest pension plan would have million effect on the fourth quarter mark to market adjustment but only net impact on segment level pension expense plan asset the expected average rate of return on plan asset is long term forward looking assumption it is required to be the expected future long term rate of earnings on plan asset our pension plan asset are invested primarily in publicly tradeable security and our pension plan hold only minimal investment in fedex common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third party pension fund investment manager part of our strategy to manage pension cost and funded status volatility we have transitioned to liability driven investment strategy to better align plan asset with liability table of content establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension asset is judgmental matter which we review on an annual basis and revise appropriate management considers the following factor in determining this assumption the duration of our pension plan liability which drive the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan asset the type of investment class in which we invest our pension plan asset and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment class to earn over time and the investment return we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the return we could expect if investment were made strictly in indexed fund for consolidated pension expense we assumed expected long term rate of return on our pension plan asset in and and in the actual return during each of the last three fiscal year have exceeded those long term assumption however for we have lowered our expected return on plan asset assumption for long term return on plan asset to we continue to implement our asset and liability management strategy in lowering this assumption we considered our historical return our current capital market outlook and our investment strategy for our plan asset including the impact of the duration of our plan liability our actual return on plan asset ha contracted from we have increased our asset allocation to lower yielding fixed income investment at the segment level we have set our eroa at for all period presented one basis point change in our expected return on plan asset impact our segment pension expense by million the actual historical annual return on our pension plan asset calculated on compound geometric basis wa net of investment manager fee and administrative expense for the year period ended may and net of investment manager fee and administrative expense for the year period ended may any difference between actual plan asset performance and the expected return is reflected in our year end mtm adjustment each fiscal year funded status following is information concerning the funded status of our pension plan of may in million funded status of plan projected benefit obligation pbo fair value of plan asset funded status of the plan cash amount cash contribution during the year benefit payment during the year funding the funding requirement for our pension plan are governed by the pension protection act of which ha aggressive funding requirement in order to avoid benefit payment restriction that become effective if the funded status determined under irs rule fall below at the beginning of plan year all of our pension plan have funded status level in excess of and our plan remain adequately funded to provide benefit to our employee they come due additionally current benefit payment are nominal compared to our total plan asset benefit payment for our pension plan for were approximately million or of plan asset during we made million in required contribution to our pension plan over the past several year we have made voluntary contribution to our pension plan in excess of the minimum required contribution amount contributed in excess of the minimum required can result in credit balance for funding purpose that can be used to reduce minimum contribution requirement in future year our current credit balance exceeds billion at may for we anticipate making contribution to our pension plan totaling million approximately million of which are required table of content see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement for further information about our retirement plan self insurance accrual we are self insured up to certain limit for cost associated with worker compensation claim vehicle accident and general business liability and benefit paid under employee healthcare and long term disability program our reserve are established for estimate of loss on reported claim including incurred but not reported claim self insurance accrual reflected in our balance sheet were billion at may and billion at may approximately of these accrual were classified current liability our self insurance accrual are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claim incurred of the balance sheet date these estimate include consideration of factor such severity of claim frequency and volume of claim healthcare inflation seasonality and plan design cost trend on material accrual are updated each quarter we self insure up to certain limit that vary by operating company and type of risk periodically we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance level based on risk tolerance and premium expense historically it ha been infrequent that incurred claim exceeded our self insured limit we believe the use of actuarial method to account for these liability provides consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accrual however the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claim involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known we believe our recorded obligation for these expense are consistently measured on conservative basis nevertheless change in healthcare cost accident frequency and severity insurance retention level and other factor can materially affect the estimate for these liability long lived asset useful life and salvage value our business is capital intensive with approximately of our total asset invested in our transportation and information system infrastructure the depreciation or amortization of our capital asset over their estimated useful life and the determination of any salvage value requires management to make judgment about future event because we utilize many of our capital asset over relatively long period the majority of aircraft cost are depreciated over to year we periodically evaluate whether adjustment to our estimated service life or salvage value are necessary to ensure these estimate properly match the economic use of the asset this evaluation may result in change in the estimated life and residual value used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment for our aircraft we typically assign no residual value due to the utilization of these asset in cargo configuration which result in little to no value at the end of their useful life these estimate affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in period and ultimately the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset change in the estimated life of asset will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future period and could have material impact on our result of operation described below historically gain and loss on disposal of operating equipment have not been material however such amount may differ materially in the future due to change in business level technological obsolescence accident frequency regulatory change and other factor beyond our control in fedex express made the decision to accelerate the retirement of aircraft and related engine to aid in our fleet modernization and improve our global network in we shortened the depreciable life for aircraft and related engine to accelerate the retirement of these aircraft resulting in depreciation expense increase of million in result of these accelerated retirement we incurred an additional million in year over year accelerated depreciation expense in table of content impairment the fedex express global air and ground network includes fleet of aircraft including approximately supplemental aircraft that provide delivery of package and freight to more than country and territory through wide range of and international shipping service while certain aircraft are utilized in primary geographic area versus international we operate an integrated global network and utilize our aircraft and other mode of transportation to achieve the lowest cost of delivery while maintaining our service commitment to our customer because of the integrated nature of our global network our aircraft are interchangeable across route and geography giving flexibility with our fleet planning to meet changing global economic condition and maintain and modify aircraft needed because of the lengthy lead time for aircraft manufacture and modification we must anticipate volume level and plan our fleet requirement year in advance and make commitment for aircraft based on those projection furthermore the timing and availability of certain used aircraft type particularly those with better fuel efficiency may create limited opportunity to acquire these aircraft at favorable price in advance of our capacity need these activity create risk that asset capacity may exceed demand aircraft purchase primarily aircraft in passenger configuration that have not been placed in service totaled million at may and million at may we plan to modify these asset in the future and place them into operation the accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with it estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the cash flow do not exceed the carrying value the asset must be adjusted to it current fair value we operate integrated transportation network and accordingly cash flow for most of our operating asset are assessed at network level not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment further decision about capital investment are evaluated based on the impact to the overall network rather than the return on an individual asset we make decision to remove certain long lived asset from service based on projection of reduced capacity need or lower operating cost of newer aircraft type and those decision may result in an impairment charge asset held for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair value le cost to sell when the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criterion are met the fair value determination for such aircraft may require management estimate there may not be active market for some of these aircraft such estimate are subject to revision from period to period in the normal management of our aircraft fleet we routinely idle aircraft and engine temporarily due to maintenance cycle and adjustment of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand level temporarily idled asset are classified available for use and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these asset these temporarily idled asset are assessed for impairment on quarterly basis the criterion for determining whether an asset ha been permanently removed from service and result impaired include but are not limited to our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume level including capacity need during our peak shipping season the introduction of new fleet type or decision to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operation and change to planned service expansion activity at may we had one aircraft temporarily idled this aircraft ha been idled for approximately two month and is expected to return to revenue service in the fourth quarter of we retired from service seven boeing aircraft and related engine four airbus aircraft and three related engine three airbus aircraft and three related engine and one boeing aircraft and three related engine and related part we also adjusted the retirement schedule of an additional aircraft and engine consequence impairment and related charge of million million net of tax or per diluted share of which million wa noncash were recorded in the fourth quarter the decision to permanently retire these aircraft and engine aligns with fedex express plan to rationalize capacity and modernize it aircraft fleet to more effectively serve it customer these combined retirement change will not have material impact on our near term depreciation expense in we retired from service two airbus aircraft and four related engine three airbus aircraft and two related engine and five boeing aircraft and related engine to align with the plan of fedex express to modernize it aircraft fleet and improve it global network consequence of this decision noncash impairment charge of million million net of tax or per diluted share wa recorded in all of these aircraft were temporarily idled and not in revenue service table of content lease we utilize operating lease to finance certain of our aircraft facility and equipment such arrangement typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the asset at the end of the lease period to the lessor disclosed in contractual cash obligation and note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement at may we had approximately billion on an undiscounted basis of future commitment for payment under operating lease the weighted average remaining lease term of all operating lease outstanding at may wa approximately six year the future commitment for operating lease are not reflected liability in our balance sheet under current accounting rule the determination of whether lease is accounted for capital lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimate primarily about the fair value of the asset and it estimated economic useful life in addition our evaluation includes ensuring we properly account for build to suit lease arrangement and making judgment about whether various form of lessee involvement during the construction period make the lessee an agent for the owner lessor or in substance the owner of the asset during the construction period we believe we have well defined and controlled process for making these evaluation including obtaining third party appraisal for material transaction to assist in making these evaluation under proposed revision to the accounting standard for lease we would be required to record an asset and liability for our outstanding operating lease similar to the current accounting for capital lease notably the amount we record in the future would be the net present value of our future lease commitment at the date of adoption this proposed guidance ha not been issued and ha been subjected to numerous revision most recently in may while we are not required to quantify the effect of the proposed rule change until they are finalized we believe that majority of our operating lease obligation reflected in the contractual cash obligation table would be required to be reflected in our balance sheet were the proposed rule to be adopted furthermore our existing financing agreement and the rating agency that evaluate our creditworthiness already take our operating lease into account goodwill of may we had billion of recorded goodwill from our business acquisition representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net asset we have acquired during we recorded billion in additional goodwill associated with our genco and bongo acquisition several factor give rise to goodwill in our acquisition such the expected benefit from synergy of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business in our evaluation of goodwill impairment we perform qualitative assessment that requires management judgment and the use of estimate to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive we proceed to two step process to test goodwill for impairment including comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying value including attributable goodwill fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodology principally the income or market approach incorporating market participant consideration and management assumption on revenue growth rate operating margin discount rate and expected capital expenditure estimate used by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test change in forecasted operating result and other assumption could materially affect these estimate we perform our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter unless circumstance indicate the need to accelerate the timing of the test our reporting unit with significant recorded goodwill include fedex express fedex ground fedex freight fedex office reported in the fedex service segment and genco reported in the fedex ground segment we evaluated these reporting unit during the fourth quarter of and the estimated fair value of each of these reporting unit exceeded their carrying value in and and we do not believe that any of these reporting unit were at risk of may contingency we are subject to various loss contingency including tax proceeding and litigation in connection with our operation contingent liability are difficult to measure their measurement is subject to multiple factor that are not easily predicted or projected further additional complexity in measuring these liability arises due to the various jurisdiction in which these matter occur which make our ability to predict their outcome highly uncertain moreover different accounting rule must be employed to account for table of content these item based on the nature of the contingency accordingly significant management judgment is required to ass these matter and to make determination about the measurement of liability if any our material pending loss contingency are described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement in the opinion of management the aggregate liability if any of individual matter or group of matter not specifically described in note is not expected to be material to our financial position result of operation or cash flow the following describes our method and associated process for evaluating these matter tax contingency we are subject to income and operating tax rule of the it state and municipality and of the foreign jurisdiction in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining income tax provision well deferred tax asset and liability balance and related deferred tax valuation allowance if necessary due to the complexity of these rule and their interaction with one another we account for income tax by recording both current tax payable and deferred tax asset and liability our provision for income tax is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we operate applied to taxable income reduced by applicable tax credit tax contingency arise from uncertainty in the application of tax rule throughout the many jurisdiction in which we operate and are impacted by several factor including tax audit appeal litigation change in tax law and other rule and their interpretation and change in our business we regularly ass the potential impact of these factor for the current and prior year to determine the adequacy of our tax provision we continually evaluate the likelihood and amount of potential adjustment and adjust our tax position including the current and deferred tax liability in the period in which the fact that give rise to revision become known in addition management considers the advice of third party in making conclusion regarding tax consequence we recognize liability for uncertain income tax position based on two step process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any the second step requires to estimate and measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amount we must determine the probability of various possible outcome we reevaluate these uncertain tax position on quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management these reevaluation are based on factor including but not limited to change in fact or circumstance change in tax law successfully settled issue under audit and new audit activity such change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of tax benefit or an increase to the related provision we classify interest related to income tax liability interest expense and if applicable penalty are recognized component of income tax expense the income tax liability and accrued interest and penalty that are due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented current liability the remaining portion of our income tax liability and accrued interest and penalty are presented noncurrent liability because payment of cash is not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date these noncurrent income tax liability are recorded in the caption other liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet we account for operating tax based on multi state local and foreign taxing jurisdiction rule in those area in which we operate provision for operating tax are estimated based upon these rule asset acquisition and disposal historical spend and other variable these provision are consistently evaluated for reasonableness against compliance and risk factor we measure and record operating tax contingency accrual in accordance with accounting guidance for contingency discussed below this guidance requires an accrual of estimated loss from contingency such tax or other legal proceeding or claim when it is probable that loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated table of content other contingency because of the complex environment in which we operate we are subject to other legal proceeding and claim including those relating to general commercial matter governmental enforcement action employment related claim and fedex ground owner operator accounting guidance for contingency requires an accrual of estimated loss from contingency such tax or other legal proceeding or claim when it is probable the future event or event are likely to occur that loss ha been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated this guidance also requires disclosure of loss contingency matter when in management judgment material loss is reasonably possible or probable during the preparation of our financial statement we evaluate our contingency to determine whether it is probable reasonably possible or remote that liability ha been incurred loss is recognized for all contingency deemed probable and estimable regardless of amount for unresolved contingency with potentially material exposure that are deemed reasonably possible we evaluate whether potential loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated our evaluation of these matter is the result of comprehensive process designed to ensure that accounting recognition of loss or disclosure of these contingency is made in timely manner and involves our legal and accounting personnel well external counsel where applicable the process includes regular communication during each quarter and scheduled meeting shortly before the completion of our financial statement to evaluate any new legal proceeding and the status of existing matter in determining whether loss should be accrued or loss contingency disclosed we evaluate among other factor the current status of each matter within the scope and context of the entire lawsuit or proceeding the lengthy and complex nature of class action matter the procedural status of each matter any opportunity to dispose of lawsuit on it merit before trial motion to dismiss or for summary judgment the amount of time remaining before trial date the status of discovery the status of settlement arbitration or mediation proceeding and our judgment regarding the likelihood of success prior to or at trial in reaching our conclusion with respect to accrual of loss or loss contingency disclosure we take holistic view of each matter based on these factor and the information available prior to the issuance of our financial statement uncertainty with respect to an individual factor or combination of these factor may impact our decision related to accrual or disclosure of loss contingency including conclusion that we are unable to establish an estimate of possible loss or meaningful range of possible loss we update our disclosure to reflect our most current understanding of the contingency at the time we issue our financial statement however event may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of contingency may result in loss to that differs materially from our previously estimated liability or range of possible loss despite the inherent complexity in the accounting and disclosure of contingency we believe that our process are robust and thorough and provide consistent framework for management in evaluating the potential outcome of contingency for proper accounting recognition and disclosure risk factor our financial and operating result are subject to many risk and uncertainty described below we are directly affected by the state of the economy while macro economic risk apply to most company we are particularly vulnerable the transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trend in economic activity our primary business is to transport good so our business level are directly tied to the purchase and production of good key macro economic measurement when individual and company purchase and produce fewer good we transport fewer good and company table of content expand the number of distribution center and move manufacturing closer to consumer market we transport good shorter distance in addition we have relatively high fixed cost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume level moreover we continue to grow our international business we are increasingly affected by the health of the global economy the rate of growth of global trade and the typically more volatile economy of emerging market in we saw continued customer preference for slower le costly shipping service our business depend on our strong reputation and the value of the fedex brand the fedex brand name symbolizes high quality service reliability and speed fedex is one of the most widely recognized trusted and respected brand in the world and the fedex brand is one of our most important and valuable asset in addition we have strong reputation among customer and the general public for high standard of social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance and ethic the fedex brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sale and marketing tool and we devote significant resource to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activity by our employee contractor or agent such customer service mishap or noncompliance with law could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand with the increase in the use of social medium outlet such youtube and twitter adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly making it increasingly difficult for to defend against damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our service and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and result of operation well require additional resource to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand we rely heavily on information and technology to operate our transportation and business network and any cybersecurity incident or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could result in the loss of critical confidential information or adversely impact our reputation business or result of operation our ability to attract and retain customer and to compete effectively depends in part upon the sophistication and reliability of our technology network including our ability to provide feature of service that are important to our customer and to protect our confidential business information and the information provided by our customer we are subject to risk imposed by cybersecurity incident which can range from uncoordinated individual attempt to gain unauthorized access to our information technology system to sophisticated and targeted measure directed at and our system customer or service provider additionally risk such code anomaly act of god transitional challenge in migrating operating company functionality to our fedex enterprise automation platform data leakage and human error pose direct threat to our product service and data any disruption to our complex global technology infrastructure including those impacting our computer system and fedex com could result in the loss of confidential business or customer information adversely impact our customer service volume and revenue or could lead to litigation or investigation resulting in significant cost these type of adverse impact could also occur in the event the confidentiality integrity or availability of company and customer information wa compromised due to data loss by fedex or trusted third party while we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiative information technology risk management and disaster recovery plan these measure can not fully insulate from cybersecurity incident technology disruption or data loss which could adversely impact our competitiveness and result of operation additionally the cost and operational consequence of implementing further data or system protection measure could be significant our transportation business are impacted by the price and availability of fuel we must purchase large quantity of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicle and the price and availability of fuel can be unpredictable and beyond our control to date we have been mostly successful in mitigating over time the expense impact of higher fuel cost through our indexed fuel surcharge the amount of the surcharge is closely linked to the market price for fuel if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharge because of competitive pricing pressure or some other reason fuel cost could adversely impact our operating result additionally if fuel price rise sharply even if we increase our fuel surcharge we could experience lag time in implementing the surcharge which could adversely affect our short term operating result even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharge high fuel surcharge could move our customer away from our higher yielding express service to our lower yielding deferred or ground table of content service or even reduce customer demand for our service altogether in addition disruption in the supply of fuel could have negative impact on our ability to operate our transportation network our business are capital intensive and we must make capital decision based upon projected volume level we make significant investment in aircraft vehicle technology package handling facility sort equipment copy equipment and other asset to support our transportation and business network we also make significant investment to rebrand integrate and grow the company that we acquire the amount and timing of capital investment depend on various factor including our anticipated volume growth we must make commitment to purchase or modify aircraft year before the aircraft are actually needed we must predict volume level and fleet requirement and make commitment for aircraft based on those projection missing our projection could result in much or too little capacity relative to our shipping volume overcapacity could lead to asset disposition or write down and undercapacity could negatively impact service level we face intense competition the transportation and business service market are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service especially in period of little or no macro economic growth some of our competitor have more financial resource than we do or they are controlled or subsidized by foreign government which enables them to raise capital more easily we also compete with regional transportation provider that operate smaller and le capital intensive transportation network in addition some high volume package shipper are developing in house ground delivery capability which would in turn reduce our revenue and market share we believe we compete effectively with these company for example by providing more reliable service at compensatory price however an irrational pricing environment can limit our ability not only to maintain or increase our price including our fuel surcharge in response to rising fuel cost but also to maintain or grow our market share while we believe we compete effectively through our current service offering if our current competitor or potential future competitor offer broader range of service or more effectively bundle their service or our current customer become competitor it could impede our ability to maintain or grow our market share if we do not successfully execute or effectively operate integrate leverage and grow acquired business our financial result and reputation may suffer our strategy for long term growth productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to make prudent strategic acquisition and to realize the benefit we expect when we make those acquisition in furtherance of this strategy over the past several year we have acquired business in europe latin america africa and the united state additionally in april we entered into conditional agreement to acquire tnt express while we expect to successfully execute the tnt express acquisition we may not be able to complete the transaction on favorable term on timely basis or at all additionally while we anticipate that our past and future acquisition will enhance our value proposition to customer and improve our long term profitability there can be no assurance that we will realize our expectation within the time frame we have established if at all or that we can continue to support the value we allocate to these acquired business including their goodwill or other intangible asset labor organization attempt to organize group of our employee from time to time and potential change in labor law could make it easier for them to do so if we are unable to continue to maintain good relationship with our employee and prevent labor organization from organizing group of our employee our operating cost could significantly increase and our operational flexibility could be significantly reduced despite continual organizing attempt by labor union other than the pilot of fedex express and driver at four fedex freight facility our employee have thus far chosen not to unionize we acquired genco in january which already had small number of employee that are member of union the congress ha in the past considered adopting change in labor law however that would make it easier for union to organize unit of our employee for example there is always possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employee from the purview of the railway labor act of amended rla for additional discussion of the rla see part item of this annual report on form under the caption regulation such legislation could expose our customer to the type of service disruption that the rla wa designed to prevent local work stoppage in key area that interrupt the timely flow of shipment of time sensitive table of content high value good throughout our global network such disruption could threaten our ability to provide competitively priced shipping option and ready access to global market there is also the possibility that congress could pas other labor legislation that could adversely affect our company such fedex ground and fedex freight whose employee are governed by the national labor relation act of amended nlra in addition federal and state governmental agency such the national labor relation board have and may continue to take action that could make it easier for our employee to organize under the rla or nlra finally change to federal or state law governing employee classification could impact the status of fedex ground owner operator independent contractor if fedex ground is compelled to convert it independent contractor to employee labor organization could more easily organize these individual our operating cost could increase materially and we could incur significant capital outlay fedex ground relies on owner operator to conduct it linehaul and pickup and delivery operation and the status of these owner operator independent contractor rather than employee is being challenged fedex ground use of independent contractor is well suited to the need of the ground delivery business and it customer evidenced by the strong growth of this business segment we are involved in numerous lawsuit and state tax and other administrative proceeding that claim that the company owner operator or their driver should be treated our employee rather than independent contractor we incur certain cost including legal fee in defending the status of fedex ground owner operator independent contractor we believe that fedex ground owner operator are properly classified independent contractor and that fedex ground is not an employer of the driver of the company independent contractor however adverse determination in these matter could among other thing entitle certain of our owner operator and their driver to the reimbursement of certain expense and to the benefit of wage and hour law and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for fedex ground and could result in change to the independent contractor status of fedex ground owner operator change to state law governing the definition of independent contractor could also impact the status of fedex ground owner operator we may not be able to achieve our profit improvement goal by the end of in we announced profit improvement program primarily through initiative at fedex express and fedex service that include cost reduction modernization of our aircraft fleet transformation of the domestic operation and international profit improvement at fedex express and improved efficiency and lower cost of information technology at fedex service to this end since we have retired from service aircraft and related engine and we have adjusted the retirement schedule of numerous aircraft and engine in an effort to rationalize capacity and modernize our aircraft fleet additionally during we completed voluntary buyout program offering cash buyout to eligible based employee we will continue to work towards our goal of annual profitability improvement at fedex express of billion by the end of our ability to achieve this objective is dependent on number of factor including the health of the global economy and future customer demand particularly for our priority service in light of these factor we may not be able to achieve our goal the transportation infrastructure continues to be target of terrorist activity because transportation asset continue to be target of terrorist activity government around the world are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirement that will increase operating cost and potentially slow service for business including those in the transportation industry for example the transportation security administration requires fedex express to comply with full all cargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains evolving and strict security requirement these requirement are not static but change periodically the result of regulatory and legislative requirement imposing additional security cost and creating level of uncertainty for our operation thus it is reasonably possible that these rule or other future security requirement could impose material cost on or slow our service to our customer moreover terrorist attack directed at fedex or other aspect of the transportation infrastructure could disrupt our operation and adversely impact demand for our service table of content the regulatory environment for global aviation or other transportation right may impact our operation our extensive air network is critical to our success our right to serve foreign point is subject to the approval of the department of transportation and generally requires bilateral agreement between the united state and foreign government in addition we must obtain the permission of foreign government to provide specific flight and service our operation outside of the united state such fedex express growing international domestic operation are also subject to current and potential regulation including certain postal regulation and licensing requirement that restrict make difficult and sometimes prohibit the ability of foreign owned company such fedex express to compete effectively in part of the international domestic transportation and logistics market regulatory action affecting global aviation or transportation right or failure to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation right in important international market could impair our ability to operate our network we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market response to such change concern over climate change including the impact of global warming ha led to significant and international legislative and regulatory effort to limit greenhouse gas ghg emission including our aircraft and diesel engine emission for example in the environmental protection agency the epa issued proposed finding on ghg emission from aircraft and it relationship to air pollution the final finding is regulatory prerequisite to the epa adoption of new certification standard for aircraft emission additionally in the european commission approved the extension of the european union emission trading scheme ets for ghg emission to the airline industry under this decision all fedex express flight that are wholly within the european union are now covered by the ets requirement and each year we are required to submit emission allowance in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emission from such flight in addition the congress ha in the past considered bill that would regulate ghg emission and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future increased regulation regarding ghg emission especially aircraft or diesel engine emission could impose substantial cost on

the asset or group of asset is le than their carrying value if impairment exists an adjustment is made to write the asset down to it fair value and loss is recorded the difference between the carrying value and fair value fair value are determined based on quoted market value discounted cash flow or internal and external appraisal applicable asset to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value we operate integrated transportation network and accordingly cash flow for most of our operating asset to be held and used are assessed at network level not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment in the normal management of our aircraft fleet we routinely idle aircraft and engine temporarily due to maintenance cycle and adjustment of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand level temporarily idled asset are classified available for use and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these asset these temporarily idled asset are assessed for impairment on quarterly basis the criterion for determining whether an asset ha been permanently removed from service and result potentially impaired include but are not limited to our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume level including capacity need during our peak shipping season the introduction of new fleet type or decision to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operation and change to planned service expansion activity at may we had one aircraft temporarily idled this aircraft ha been idled for approximately two month and is expected to return to revenue service in may we retired from service seven boeing aircraft and related engine four

tangible and identifiable intangible net asset of business acquired several factor give rise to goodwill in our acquisition such the expected benefit from synergy of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment in our evaluation of goodwill impairment we perform qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive we proceed to two step process to test goodwill for impairment including comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying value including attributable goodwill fair value for our reporting unit is determined using an income or market approach incorporating market participant consideration and management assumption on revenue growth rate operating margin discount rate and expected capital expenditure fair value determination may include both internal and third party valuation unless circumstance otherwise dictate we perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter pension and postretirement healthcare plan our defined benefit plan are measured using actuarial technique that reflect management assumption for discount rate investment return on plan asset salary increase expected retirement mortality employee turnover and future increase in healthcare cost we determine the discount rate which is required to be the rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled of the measurement date with the assistance of actuary who calculate the yield on theoretical portfolio of high grade corporate bond rated aa or better with cash flow that are designed to match our expected benefit payment in future year our expected rate of return is judgmental matter which is reviewed on an annual basis and revised appropriate during the fourth quarter of we changed our method of accounting for our defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plan under our new method of accounting we will immediately recognize change in the fair value of plan asset and actuarial gain or loss in our operating result annually in the fourth quarter each year further we voluntarily changed our method for determining the expected return on plan asset eroa which is used in the calculation of pension and other postretirement expense for funded postretirement benefit plan for interim period we now use the fair value of plan asset to calculate the eroa the new method of accounting are collectively referred to mark to market or mtm accounting historically we recognized actuarial gain and loss subject to corridor component of other comprehensive income and amortized these gain and loss component of pension and postretirement healthcare expense over the average future service period of the covered employee year previously we used calculated value method to determine the value of plan asset and amortized change in the fair value of plan asset over period no longer than four year we believe the immediate recognition of actuarial gain and loss under mtm accounting is preferable method of accounting it aligns the recognition of change in the fair value of plan asset and liability in the income statement with the fair value accounting principle that are used to measure the net funded status of the plan in our balance sheet mtm accounting also eliminates the impact on future period of the amortization of the increasingly material amount of accumulated actuarial loss resulting from persistently low interest rate and change in demographic assumption the adoption of mtm accounting is voluntary change in accounting principle that is required to be adopted retrospectively therefore all period presented have been recast to conform to the current year presentation reflecting the retirement plan accounting change discussed further in note and note table of content the cumulative effect of the

income tax position based on two step process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any the second step requires to estimate and measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amount we must determine the probability of various possible outcome we reevaluate these uncertain tax position on quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management these reevaluation are based on factor including but not limited to change in fact or circumstance change in tax law successfully settled issue under audit and new audit activity such change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of tax benefit or an increase to

accumulated other comprehensive income disclosure requirement in note of our consolidated financial statement on may the fasb and international accounting standard board issued new accounting standard that will supersede virtually all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principle in the united state and international financial reporting standard which ha been subsequently updated to defer the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year this standard will be effective for beginning in fiscal the fundamental principle of the new guidance are that company should recognize revenue in manner that reflects the timing of the transfer of service to customer and the amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that company expects to receive for the good and service provided the new guidance establishes five step approach for the recognition of revenue based on our preliminary assessment we do not anticipate

valuation allowance primarily represent amount reserved for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards which expire over varying period starting in result of this and other factor we believe that substantial portion of these deferred tax asset may not be realized we establish valuation allowance if it is not likely we will realize our deferred income tax asset in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumption we consider among other thing our future projection of sustained profitability deferred income tax liability the overall business environment our historical financial result and potential current and future tax planning strategy if we were to identify and table of content implement tax planning strategy to recover these deferred tax asset or generate sufficient income of the appropriate character in these jurisdiction in the future it could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowance and reduction of income tax expense we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefit related to the remaining net deferred tax asset in our consolidated balance sheet permanently reinvested earnings of our foreign subsidiary amounted to billion at the end of and billion at the end of we have not recognized deferred tax for federal income tax purpose on those

to be distributed in the form of dividend or otherwise these earnings could be subject to federal income tax and non withholding tax unrecognized foreign tax credit potentially could be available to reduce portion of any tax liability determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability is not practicable due to uncertainty related to the timing and source of any potential distribution of such fund along with other important factor such the amount of associated foreign tax credit cash in offshore jurisdiction associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy totaled million at the end of and million at the end of in approximately of our total enterprise wide income wa earned in company of fedex that are taxable in the united state reduction from due to our adoption of mtm accounting airline our fedex express unit is required by federal aviation administration and other rule to conduct it air operation domestic and international through company however we serve more than country and territory around the world and are required to establish legal entity in many of them most of our entity in those country are operating entity engaged in picking up and delivering package and performing other transportation service we are continually expanding our global network to meet our customer need which requires increasing investment outside the we typically use cash generated overseas to fund these investment and have foreign holding company which manages our investment in several foreign operating company we are subject to taxation in the and various state local and foreign jurisdiction the irs is currently examining our and tax return it is reasonably possible that certain income tax return proceeding will be completed during the next month and could result in change in our balance of unrecognized tax benefit the expected impact of any change would not be material to our consolidated financial statement reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefit is follows in million balance at beginning of year increase for tax position taken in the current year increase for tax position taken in prior year decrease for tax position taken in prior year settlement increase due to acquisition decrease from lapse of statute of limitation change due to currency translation balance at end of year our liability recorded for uncertain tax position include million at may and million at may associated with position that if favorably resolved would provide benefit to our effective tax rate we classify interest related to income tax liability interest expense and if applicable penalty are recognized component of income tax expense the balance of accrued interest and penalty wa million on may and may total interest and penalty included in our consolidated statement of income are immaterial table of content it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for tax position change may result from the conclusion of ongoing audit appeal or litigation in state local federal and foreign tax jurisdiction or from the resolution of various proceeding between the and foreign tax authority our liability for uncertain tax position includes no matter that are individually or collectively material to it is reasonably possible that the amount of the benefit with respect to certain of our unrecognized tax position will increase or decrease within the next month but an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change can not be made however we do not expect that the resolution of any of our uncertain tax position will have material effect on note retirement plan we sponsor program that provide retirement benefit to most of our employee these program include defined benefit pension plan defined contribution plan and postretirement healthcare plan the accounting for pension and postretirement healthcare plan includes numerous assumption such discount rate expected long term investment return on plan asset future salary increase employee turnover mortality and retirement age during the fourth quarter of we adopted mark to market accounting for the recognition of our actuarial gain and loss related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plan described in note the accounting guidance related to postretirement benefit requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan and the recognition in either expense or aoci of unrecognized gain or loss and prior service cost or credit the funded status is measured the difference between the fair value of the plan asset and the projected benefit obligation pbo of the plan summary of our retirement plan cost over the past three year is follows well the amount associated with each component of the pre tax mark to market loss gain in million defined benefit pension plan defined contribution plan postretirement healthcare plan retirement plan mark to market adjustment the component of the pre tax mark to market loss gain are follows in million discount rate change actual versus expected return on asset demographic assumption change total mark to market loss gain the implementation of new mortality table in resulted in an increased participant life expectancy assumption which increased the overall projected benefit obligation by billion the weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan declined from at may to at may the actual rate of return on our pension plan asset of exceeded our expected return of primarily due to favorable investment environment for global equity market the weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan decreased from at may to at may table of content the weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan increased from at may to at may the actual rate of return on our pension plan asset of exceeded our expected return of primarily due to favorable investment environment for global equity and credit market pension plan our largest pension plan cover certain employee age and over with at least one year of service pension benefit for most employee are accrued under cash balance formula we call the portable pension account under the portable pension account the retirement benefit is expressed dollar amount in notional account that grows with annual credit based on pay age and year of credited service and interest on the notional account balance the portable pension account benefit is payable lump sum or an annuity at retirement at the election of the employee the plan interest credit rate varies from year to year based on treasury index prior to certain employee earned benefit using traditional pension formula based on average earnings and year of service benefit under this formula were capped on may for most employee we also sponsor or participate in nonqualified benefit plan covering certain of our employee group and other pension plan covering certain of our international employee the international defined benefit pension plan provide benefit primarily based on earnings and year of service and are funded in compliance with local law and practice postretirement healthcare plan certain of our subsidiary offer medical dental and vision coverage to eligible retiree and their eligible dependent employee covered by the principal plan become eligible for these benefit at age and older if they have permanent continuous service of at least year after attainment of age if hired prior to january or at least year after attainment of age if hired on or after january postretirement healthcare benefit are capped at of the per caput projected employer cost which ha been reached and therefore these benefit are not subject to additional future inflation pension plan assumption our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligation the level of plan asset available to fund those obligation and the expected long term rate of return on plan asset we use measurement date of may for our pension and postretirement healthcare plan management review the assumption used to measure pension cost on an annual basis economic and market condition at the measurement date impact these assumption from year to year actuarial gain or loss are generated for change in assumption and to the extent that actual result differ from those assumed these actuarial gain and loss are immediately recognized and expensed in fourth quarter mark to market adjustment weighted average actuarial assumption for our primary retirement plan which represent substantially all of our pbo and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo are follows pension plan postretirement healthcare plan discount rate used to determine benefit obligation discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost rate of increase in future compensation level used to determine benefit obligation rate of increase in future compensation level used to determine net periodic benefit cost expected long term rate of return on asset consolidated expected long term rate of return on asset segment reporting table of content the expected average rate of return on plan asset is the expected future long term rate of earnings on plan asset and is forward looking assumption that materially affect our pension cost establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension asset is judgmental matter we review the expected long term rate of return on an annual basis and revise it appropriate management considers the following factor in determining this assumption the duration of our pension plan liability which drive the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan asset the type of investment class in which we invest our pension plan asset and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment class to earn over time and the investment return we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the return we could expect if investment were made strictly in indexed fund our consolidated expected long term rate of return on plan asset wa in and and in our actual return in each of the past three year exceeded those amount for our principal domestic pension plan however for we have lowered our eroa assumption for long term return on plan asset to we continue to implement our asset and liability management strategy in lowering this assumption we considered our historical return our current capital market outlook and our investment strategy for our plan asset including the impact of the duration of our plan liability our actual return on plan asset ha contracted from we have increased our asset allocation to lower yielding fixed income investment for the year period ended may our actual annual return were the investment strategy for pension plan asset is to utilize diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolio together with fixed income portfolio to earn long term investment return that meet our pension plan obligation our pension plan asset are invested primarily in publicly tradeable security and our pension plan hold only minimal investment in fedex common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third party pension fund investment manager our largest holding class are corporate fixed income security and government fixed income security which are largely benchmarked against the barclays long government long corporate index and and international large cap equity which are mainly indexed to the index and other global index accordingly we do not have any significant concentration of risk active management strategy are utilized within the plan in an effort to realize investment return in excess of market index part of our strategy to manage pension cost and funded status volatility we have transitioned to liability driven investment strategy to better align plan asset with liability our investment strategy also includes the limited use of derivative financial instrument on discretionary basis to improve investment return and manage exposure to market risk in all case our investment manager are prohibited from using derivative for speculative purpose and are not permitted to use derivative to leverage portfolio following is description of the valuation methodology used for investment measured at fair value cash and cash equivalent these level investment include cash cash equivalent and foreign currency valued using exchange rate the

reporting purpose and are not included in the table above we have several aircraft modernization program underway that are supported by the purchase of and aircraft these aircraft are significantly more fuel efficient per unit than the aircraft type previously utilized and these expenditure are necessary to achieve significant long term operating saving and to replace older aircraft our ability to delay the timing of these aircraft related expenditure is limited without incurring significant cost to modify existing purchase agreement during september fedex express entered into an agreement

containing various class action allegation of wage and hour violation the plaintiff in these lawsuit allege among other thing that they were forced to work off the clock were not paid overtime or were not provided work break or other benefit the complaint generally seek unspecified monetary damage injunctive relief or both we do not believe that material loss is reasonably possible with respect to any of these matter independent contractor lawsuit and state administrative proceeding fedex ground is involved in numerous class action lawsuit including that have been certified class action individual lawsuit and state tax and other administrative proceeding that claim that the company owner operator should be treated employee rather than independent contractor most of the class action lawsuit were consolidated for administration of the pre trial proceeding by single federal court the district court for the northern district of indiana the multidistrict litigation court granted class certification in case and denied it in case on december the court entered an opinion and order addressing all outstanding motion for summary judgment on the status of the owner operator independent contractor employee in sum the court ruled on our summary judgment motion and entered judgment in favor of fedex ground on all claim in of the multidistrict litigation case that had been certified class action finding that the owner operator in those case were contractor matter of the law of state the plaintiff filed notice of appeal in all of these case the seventh circuit heard the appeal in the kansa case in january and in july issued an opinion that did not make determination with respect to the correctness of the district court decision and instead certified two question to the kansa supreme court related to the classification of the plaintiff independent contractor under the kansa wage payment act the other case that are before the seventh circuit were stayed pending decision of the kansa supreme court table of content on october the kansa supreme court determined that factor right to control test applies to claim under the kansa wage payment act and concluded that under that test the class member were employee not independent contractor the case wa subsequently transferred back to the seventh circuit where both party made filing requesting the action necessary to complete the resolution of the appeal the party also made recommendation to the court regarding next step for the other case that are before the seventh circuit fedex ground ha requested that each of those case be separately briefed given the potential difference in the applicable state law from that in kansa during the second quarter of we established an accrual for the estimated probable loss in the kansa case that wa required to be recognized pursuant to applicable accounting standard this amount wa immaterial on july the seventh circuit issued an order and opinion confirming the decision of the kansa supreme court concluding that the class member are employee not independent contractor additionally the seventh circuit referred the other case to representative of the court for purpose of setting case management conference to address briefing and argument for those case the multidistrict litigation court remanded the other eight certified class action back to the district court where they were originally filed because it summary judgment ruling did not completely dispose of all of the claim in those lawsuit three of these matter settled for immaterial amount and have received court approval one of the case is currently pending in the eastern district of arkansas another case wa appealed to the eleventh circuit court of appeal where the court reversed the class wide summary judgment decision on may and remanded the case for trial holding that there are disputed issue of fact to whether the class member are employee or independent contractor two case in oregon and one in california were appealed to the ninth circuit court of appeal where the court reversed the district court decision and held that the plaintiff in california and oregon were employee matter of law and remanded the case to their respective district court for further proceeding in the first quarter of we recognized an accrual for the then estimated probable loss in those case that wa required to be recognized pursuant to applicable accounting standard this amount wa immaterial in june the party in the california case engaged in mediation and reached an agreement to settle the matter for million and we have increased the accrual to that amount the settlement agreement ha been filed with the court for approval in the oregon case material exposure above the accrued amount is reasonably possible we continue to evaluate what fact may arise in the course of discovery and what legal ruling the court may render and how these fact and ruling might impact fedex ground loss for number of reason we are not currently able to estimate range of reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued the number and identity of plaintiff in these lawsuit are uncertain they are dependent on how the class of full time driver is defined and how many individual will qualify based on whatever criterion may be established in addition the party have conducted only limited discovery into damage which could vary considerably from plaintiff to plaintiff and be dependent on evidence pertaining to individual plaintiff which ha yet to be produced in the case further the range of potential loss could be impacted substantially by future ruling by the court including on the merit of the claim on fedex ground defense and on evidentiary issue with respect to the matter that are pending outside of oregon it is reasonably possible that potential loss in some of these lawsuit or change to the independent contractor status of fedex ground owner operator could be material similar to our analysis of loss contingency in the oregon case we continue to evaluate what fact may arise in the course of discovery and what legal ruling the court may render and how these fact and ruling might impact fedex ground loss consequence of many of the same factor described above well others that are specific to these case we are not currently able to estimate range of reasonably possible loss we do not believe that material loss is probable in these matter in addition we are defending contractor model case that are not or are no longer part of the multidistrict litigation these case are in varying stage of litigation and we do not expect to incur material loss in any of these matter adverse determination in matter related to fedex ground independent contractor could among other thing entitle certain of our owner operator and their driver to the reimbursement of certain expense and to the benefit of wage and hour law and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for fedex ground and could result in change to the independent contractor status of fedex ground owner operator in certain jurisdiction we believe that fedex ground owner operator are properly classified independent contractor and that fedex ground is not an employer of the driver of the company independent contractor table of content city and

term and maturity we have interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligation change in interest rate impact our liability associated with these benefit plan well the

negative in however favorable foreign currency fluctuation also may have had an offsetting impact on the price we obtained or the demand for our service which is not quantifiable at may the result of
