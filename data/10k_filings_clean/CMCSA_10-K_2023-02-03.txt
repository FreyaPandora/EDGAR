expense in our medium segment are cyclical result of our periodic broadcast of major sporting event such the olympic game and the super bowl in particular advertising revenue increase due to increased demand for advertising time for these event and distribution revenue increase in the period of broadcast of the olympic game cost and expense also increase result of our production cost for these broadcast and the amortization of the related right fee revenue in cable communication medium and sky is also subject to cyclical advertising pattern and change in viewership level advertising revenue in the united state is generally higher in the second and fourth quarter of each year and in even numbered year due to increase in advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season and advertising related to candidate running for political office and issue oriented advertising respectively revenue in medium also fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired which typically result in additional advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarter of each year advertising revenue in sky typically ha seasonally higher audience level in winter month with lower level in summer month due to the timing of european football season and summer vacation there is also increased competition for advertising at sky during major sporting event aired by public service broadcaster such the fifa world cuptm revenue in studio fluctuates due to the timing nature and number of film released in movie theater on dvd blu ray disc and through various other distribution platform including viewing on demand dtc platform or ott service provider release date are determined by several factor including competition and the timing of

the second half of each year to attract new customer exclusive sport right such european football play key role within sky wider content strategy in europe broadcasting right for major sport are usually tendered through competitive auction process with the winning bidder or bidder acquiring right over to year period this creates some level of cyclicality although the staggered timing of major sport right auction usually give sky time to react to any material change in the competitive dynamic of the prevailing market legislation and regulationour business are subject to various federal state and local law and regulation with some also subject to international law and regulation in particular the communication act of amended the communication act and federal communication commission fcc regulation and policy affect significant aspect of our cable communication and broadcast business in the united state beyond the more significant regulation summarized below legislator and regulator at all level of government frequently consider changing and sometimes change existing statute rule or regulation or interpretation of existing statute rule or regulation or prescribe new one any of which may significantly affect our business and ability to effectively compete these legislator and regulator along with some state attorney general and foreign governmental authority have been active in conducting inquiry and review regarding our service state legislative and regulatory initiative can create patchwork of different and or conflicting state requirement such with respect to privacy and open internet net neutrality regulation that can affect our business and ability to effectively compete annual report on form ktable of contentslegislative and regulatory activity ha increased under the biden administration particularly with respect to broadband network for example congress ha approved ten of billion of dollar in new funding for broadband deployment and adoption initiative and may consider other proposal that address communication issue including whether it rewrite the entire communication act to account for change in the communication marketplace and whether it should enact new permanent open internet net neutrality requirement federal agency likewise may consider adopting new regulation for communication service including broadband state and locality are also increasingly proposing new regulation impacting communication service including broader regulation of broadband network any of these regulation could significantly affect our business and compliance cost in addition united state and foreign regulator and court could adopt new interpretation of existing competition or antitrust law or enact new competition or antitrust law or regulatory tool that could negatively impact our business any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative action may increase our cost or impose additional restriction on our business some of which may be significant we are unable to predict the outcome or effect of any of these potential action or any other legislative or regulatory proposal on our business the following paragraph summarize the more significant legal and regulatory requirement and risk affecting our business communication related regulation in the united statesbroadbandour broadband service are subject to number of regulation and commitment the fcc frequently considers imposing new broadband related regulation such those relating to an open internet and from time to time imposing new regulatory obligation on internet service provider isps such state and locality also consider new broadband related regulation from time to time including those regarding government owned broadband network net neutrality and broadband affordability new broadband regulation if adopted may have adverse effect on our business we may also be subject to additional broadband related commitment condition of receiving federal or state broadband funding broadband deployment and adoption initiativesthere have been and may continue to be substantial broadband deployment funding initiative at the federal and state level that could subsidize other service provider building network within our footprint and ii potential expansion of our network to new area federal agency are adopting rule for recently enacted federal broadband funding program in many case state will disburse these federal broadband fund and may adopt additional requirement on provider that are awarded funding which may impose additional cost constraint and burden on our business we can not predict requirement will ultimately be adopted such fund will be awarded or the impact of these initiative on our business in congress created the affordable connectivity program acp to provide monthly discount toward broadband service for eligible low income household starting in this new longer term program replaced the emergency broadband benefit ebb program established during the covid pandemic we participated in ebb and are participating in acp we can not predict the extent to which eligible household will opt to use their acp benefit towards our broadband service open internet regulationsvarious form of open internet regulation can significantly affect our broadband service in the fcc reversed it prior classification of broadband internet access service telecommunication service under title ii of the communication act and classified it an information service under title in addition it eliminated it prior net neutrality rule prohibiting isps from blocking access to lawful content on the internet impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content application or service throttling prioritizing certain internet traffic in exchange for consideration or in favor of an affiliate paid or affiliated prioritization and generally prohibiting isps from unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging consumer ability to access and use the lawful internet content application service or device of their choosing or unreasonably interfering with or disadvantaging edge provider ability to make lawful content application service or device available to consumer general conduct standard the fcc stated that jurisdiction to regulate isp conduct would rest at the federal trade commission ftc and it expressly preempted all state open internet law in addition the fcc revised the transparency rule to add requirement that isps disclose any blocking and throttling practice and any paid or affiliated prioritization practice associated with their broadband offering we have disclosed that we do not block throttle or engage in paid or affiliated prioritization and have committed not to block throttle or discriminate lawful content the ftc ha authority to enforce these public commitment and the fcc ha authority to enforce compliance with it transparency rule comcast annual report on form of contentsthe fcc decision wa challenged and in the court of appeal for the district of columbia largely upheld the fcc decision including the classification of broadband an information service and repeal of it prior rule however it vacated the fcc express preemption of all state open internet law but noted that state law may nevertheless conflict with federal law or policy and be preempted on case by case basis several state have passed or introduced legislation or have adopted executive order that impose open internet requirement in variety of way and new state legislation may be introduced and adopted in the future such attempt by the state to regulate have the potential to create differing and or conflicting state regulation the fcc under the biden administration likely will revisit the regulatory classification of broadband internet access service and reclassify it telecommunication service which would authorize the fcc to subject it to traditional common carriage regulation under title ii of the communication act under title ii framework the fcc could potentially regulate our customer rate speed data usage threshold or other term for internet service and could prohibit or seriously restrict arrangement between and internet content application and service provider including backbone interconnection arrangement any fcc action could impact state open internet initiative and also could prompt further litigation congress may also consider legislation addressing these regulation and the regulatory framework for broadband internet access service we can not predict whether or how the rule might be changed the impact of potential new legislation or the outcome of any litigation municipally owned broadband networksa number of local municipality operate municipally owned broadband network and there may be further effort by local government to expand or create government owned network particularly in light of federal funding for broadband deployment certain state have enacted law that restrict or prohibit local municipality from operating municipally owned broadband network and there may be effort in other state legislature to restrict the development of government owned network although others may choose to ease or facilitate such network much of the federal funding authorized for broadband deployment is conditioned on state agreeing to make it available for potential use by government owned network although the funding prioritizes deployment to unserved area and location we can not predict how successful any of those effort will be and how they might affect our business video the video marketplace continues to become even more competitive particularly with dtc streaming and other ott service provider there are number of law and regulation that apply solely to multichannel video programming distributor mvpds or cable operator such our cable communication business and to cable network and local broadcast television station operated by nbcuniversal these law and regulation can constrain our ability to compete particularly against dtc streaming and other ott service provider which are not subject to these same requirement cable pricing and packagingwhile our video service are not subject to rate regulation certain state entity monitor and challenge in court the marketing and advertising of our service and some have attempted to regulate the service package we offer and our billing practice we can not predict the outcome of any current litigation with state entity or whether other state may pursue similar action cable franchisingcable operator generally operate their cable system under nonexclusive franchise granted by local or state franchising authority while the term and condition of franchise vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction franchise typically last for fixed term obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fee and meet service quality customer service and other requirement and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provision franchising authority also may require adequate channel capacity facility and financial support for public educational and governmental access programming and other in kind contribution the communication act also contains provision governing the franchising process including renewal procedure designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denial of renewal and unreasonable renewal condition we believe that our franchise renewal prospect are generally favorable but can not guarantee the future renewal of any individual franchise the fcc adopted an order in that prohibits state and local authority from imposing duplicative franchise and or fee requirement on the provision of broadband and other non cable service affirming that franchise fee were subject to federal statutory cap of of cable service revenue and could not include other revenue the order further required that in kind contribution such courtesy service generally should be treated franchise fee subject to that cap the order wa substantially upheld by the court of appeal for the sixth circuit several locality have attempted generally unsuccessfully to date to impose franchise fee on dtc streaming and other ott service provider annual report on form ktable of contentsprogram carriagefcc regulation prohibit from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated video programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of it non affiliation in the selection term or condition for it carriage in addition cable operator and other mvpds in the united state are prohibited from requiring condition of carriage financial interest in or exclusive distribution right for video programming network we have been involved in program carriage dispute at the fcc well in the court and may be subject to new complaint in the future program accessthe communication act and fcc regulation generally prevent cable network affiliated with cable operator from favoring affiliated cable operator over competing mvpds the fcc and congress have considered proposal that would require company that own multiple cable network to make each of their network available individually when negotiating distribution agreement with mvpds and potentially with dtc streaming and other ott service provider we currently offer our cable network on packaged basis in tier and in various case individually we have been involved in program access dispute at the fcc and may be subject to new complaint in the future must carry retransmission consentcable operator are required to carry without compensation programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television station an alternative to this must carry requirement local broadcast television station may choose to negotiate with the cable operator for retransmission consent under which the station give up it must carry right and instead seek to negotiate carriage agreement with the cable operator which frequently will involve payment to the station we currently pay certain local broadcast television station in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of the station broadcast programming to our video service customer and expect to continue to be subject to demand for increased payment and other concession from local broadcast television station failure to reach retransmission consent agreement with broadcaster could result in the loss of popular programming on our video service every three year each local commercial broadcast television station must elect for each cable system either must carry or retransmission consent similar regulatory scheme applies to satellite provider for the three year period from january to december all of our owned nbc and telemundo local broadcast television station elected retransmission consent although we have reached retransmission consent agreement with almost all mvpds in the past there can be no assurance that we will always be able to renew those agreement under favorable term or at all broadcast licensinglocal broadcast television station may be operated only in accordance with license issued by the fcc upon finding that the grant of the license will serve the public interest convenience and necessity the fcc grant broadcast television station license for year cycle which may be renewed with or without condition the fcc renewed all of our broadcast television station license without condition during the last license renewal cycle the current television license renewal cycle began in and some of our license have been renewed although our license have been renewed in prior cycle there can be no assurance that we will always obtain renewal grant broadcast ownership restrictionsthe communication act and fcc regulation impose certain limitation on local and national television ownership well limit on foreign ownership in broadcast television station some of these limitation currently are under review at the fcc including the national television ownership limit the local television ownership limit and the prohibition on each of the four major broadcast television network abc cbs fox and nbc from under common ownership or control with another

the fcc reallocates other spectrum band that cable communication and nbcuniversal use which could disrupt our service and impose additional cost voicewe provide voice service using voip technology the

service discontinuance and certain regulatory filing requirement the fcc ha not yet ruled on whether voip service such ours should be classified an information service or telecommunication service under the communication act the classification determination is important because telecommunication service are regulated more extensively than information service the court of appeal for the eighth circuit ha held that voip is an information service and preempted state regulation of voip and the supreme court ha declined to review that determination but that ruling remains limited to the seven state located in that circuit state regulatory commission and legislature in other jurisdiction may continue to consider imposing regulatory requirement on our voice service long the regulatory

highly competitive and dynamic industry and our business and result of operation could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively all of our business operate in intensely competitive consumer driven rapidly changing environment we compete with growing number of company that provide broad range of communication product and service and entertainment sport news and information content to consumer there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against our competitor or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our business below is summary of our most significant source of competition for more detailed description of the competition facing our business see item business and refer to the competition discussion within that section cable communication and sky broadband service compete primarily against wireline telecommunication company including many that are increasing deployment of fiber based network wireless telecommunication company offering internet service using variety of technology including and wireless broadband service and fixed wireless network certain electric cooperative and municipality in the united state that own and operate their own broadband network and db and newer satellite broadband provider broadband deployment funding initiative at the federal and state level including part of the america rescue plan act of may result in other service provider deploying new subsidized internet access network within our footprint and in case where we agree to receive subsidy may impose constraint on how we conduct our business in certain area competition for video service offered by cable communication and sky consists primarily of dtc streaming and other ott service provider db provider and telecommunication company our voice and wireless service primarily compete with wireless and wireline telecommunication provider many of our competitor offer bundled product and service with favorable pricing to customer which ha increased competition nbcuniversal and sky face substantial and increasing competition from provider of similar type of entertainment sport news and information content well from other form of entertainment and recreational activity nbcuniversal and sky must compete to obtain talent popular content including sport programming and other resource required to successfully operate their business this competition ha intensified dtc streaming and other ott service provider develop high quality programming and acquire live sport programming right to attract viewer consolidation of or cooperation between our competitor including supplier and distributor of content may increase competition in all of these area may the emergence of additional competitor with significant resource greater efficiency of scale fewer regulatory burden and more competitive pricing and packaging that are competing with our business in all form of content distribution and production for example such consolidation or cooperation may allow competitor to offer free or lower cost streaming service potentially on an exclusive basis through unlimited data usage plan for internet or wireless phone service the ability of our business to compete effectively also depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituency including our customer consumer advertiser business partner employee investor and government authority in addition our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customer with satisfactory customer experience change in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our business and challenge existing business model distribution platform for viewing and purchasing content have been and will likely continue to be developed that further increase the number of competitor that all our business face and challenge existing business model consumer increasingly turn to dtc streaming and other ott service the number of cable communication video customer and amount of subscriber fee paid to nbcuniversal television network decrease even cable communication broadband service have become more important to consumer dtc streaming and other ott service have driven and will continue to drive change in consumer behavior consumer seek more control over when where and how they consume content and access communication service and how much they pay for such content comcast annual report on form of contentscable communication continues to experience accelerated net loss in it video and voice customer for example in europe more of sky new video customer have recently subscribed and may continue to subscribe to now sky dtc streaming service instead of it traditional dth video service although we have attempted to adapt our video service offering enhance our broadband service for changing consumer behavior and offer new programming such peacock the continuing trend of content owner delivering their content directly to consumer rather than through or in addition to traditional video distribution channel continues to disrupt traditional distribution business model the increase in dtc streaming and other ott service provider well in gaming and virtual reality product and service also ha significantly increased the number of entertainment choice available to consumer which ha intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally ha been distributed and viewed by consumer the use of dtc streaming and other ott service reduces traditional television viewership coupled with time shifting technology such dvr and on demand service ha caused and likely will continue to cause audience rating decline for our television programming channel in addition more programming provider offer their content directly to consumer through their own apps or platform they may reduce the quantity and quality of the programming they license to nbcuniversal or sky television channel or to peacock our result of operation may be impacted we license our own content exclusively on our content platform including peacock rather than receiving license revenue from third party for right to such content our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitor or change in consumer behavior including among younger consumer and shifting business model could have an adverse effect on our competitive position business and result of operation decline in advertiser expenditure or change in advertising market could negatively impact our business we compete for the sale of advertising time with digital medium distributor website and search engine other television network and station well with all other advertising platform such radio and print we derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising and decline in expenditure by advertiser including through traditional linear television distribution model could negatively impact our result of operation decline can be caused by the economic prospect of specific advertiser or industry increased competition for the leisure time of viewer such from social medium and video game audience fragmentation increased viewing of content through dtc streaming and other ott service provider increased use of time shifting and advertising blocking technology regulatory intervention regarding where and when advertising may be placed or economic condition generally in addition advertiser have shifted portion of their total expenditure to digital medium and this trend may continue or accelerate their willingness to purchase advertising from may be adversely affected by lower audience rating and reduced viewership which many of nbcuniversal network and some of sky television channel have experienced and likely will continue to experience or from the level of popularity or perceived acceptance of peacock advertising sale and rate also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodology do not accurately reflect actual viewership level programming expense for our video service are increasing on per subscriber basis which could adversely affect cable communication video business we expect programming expense for our video service to continue to be the largest single expense item for our cable communication segment and to continue to increase on per subscriber basis part of cable communication programming expense include payment to certain local broadcast television station in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video service customer we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demand for payment and other concession from local broadcast television station these market factor may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the medium industry which may further increase our programming expense if we are unable to offset programming cost increase through rate increase the sale of additional service cost management or other initiative the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our cable communication segment result of operation moreover our contract with content provider expire there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable term or at all in which case we may be unable to provide such content part of cable communication video service and our business and result of operation could be adversely affected annual report on form ktable of contentsnbcuniversal and sky success depends on consumer acceptance of their content and their business may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance nbcuniversal and sky create and acquire medium and entertainment content the success of which depends substantially on consumer taste and preference that often change in unpredictable way the success of these business depends on our ability to consistently create acquire market and distribute television programming filmed entertainment theme park attraction and other content that meet the changing preference of the broad domestic and international consumer market we have invested and will continue to invest substantial amount in our content including in the production of original content for nbcuniversal including peacock and sky in our film and for new theme park and theme park attraction before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance in addition there can be no assurance that peacock will continue to grow or sustain it revenue or user base or successfully compete standalone dtc streaming service nbcuniversal and sky also obtain significant portion of their content from third party such movie studio television production company sport organization and other supplier sometimes on an exclusive basis competition for popular content particularly for sport programming is intense and at time we may increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitor for popular content we also may be unable to license popular third party content for nbcuniversal and sky television programming channel if medium company determine that licensing the content to is not in their strategic best interest for example content creator have launched and may continue to launch their own dtc streaming or other ott service forgoing license fee from to provide their content directly to consumer or they may license their content to our competitor on an exclusive basis entering into or renewing contract for such programming right or acquiring additional right ha in the past resulted and may result in the future in significantly increased cost particularly with respect to long term contract for sport programming right for nbcuniversal and sky our result of operation and cash flow over the term of contract depend on number of factor including the strength of the advertising market audience size the timing and amount of right payment and the ability to secure distribution from impose surcharge on or obtain carriage on multichannel video provider or to grow and retain subscriber to our own dtc service there can be no assurance that revenue from these contract will exceed our cost for the right well the other cost of producing and distributing the programming if our content doe not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if we can not obtain or retain right to popular content on acceptable term or at all nbcuniversal and sky business may be adversely affected the loss of programming distribution and licensing agreement or the renewal of these agreement on le favorable term could adversely affect our business nbcuniversal cable television network depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreement with traditional and virtual multichannel video provider the number of subscriber to nbcuniversal cable television network ha been and likely will continue to be reduced result of fewer subscriber to multichannel video provider in addition nbcuniversal broadcast television network depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreement with third party local broadcast television station in the market where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station our owned local broadcast television station must elect with respect to retransmission by certain multichannel video provider either must carry status in which we require the provider to carry the station without paying any compensation to or retransmission consent in which we give up our right to mandatory carriage and instead seek to negotiate the term and condition of carriage including the amount of compensation if any paid to by such provider sky also depends on it ability to secure and maintain wholesale distribution agreement for it television channel with multichannel video provider for all of these type of arrangement nbcuniversal and sky ability to renew agreement on favorable term may be affected by industry consolidation and new participant entering the market for distribution of content on digital platform there can be no assurance that any of these agreement will be entered into or renewed in the future on acceptable term the inability to enter into or renew these agreement could reduce our revenue and the reach of our programming which could adversely affect nbcuniversal and sky business comcast annual report on form of contentsless favorable european telecommunication access regulation the loss of sky transmission access agreement with satellite or telecommunication provider or the renewal of these agreement on le favorable term could adversely affect sky business sky relies on various third party telecommunication provider to deliver it video broadband voice and wireless phone service to it customer for example sky relies on satellite transponder capacity leased from third party to provide most of it video service in addition under the current regulatory regime in the united kingdom ireland and italy sky access network owned by third party telecommunication provider to offer it broadband and phone service in many case on regulated term including price if there is change in regulation in these market the regulated term could become le favorable moreover specific pricing term of sky wholesale fiber access are not regulated result if sky is only able to enter into or renew it transmission agreement with satellite or telecommunication operator on le favorable term it would adversely affect sky ability to compete and if it is ultimately unable to do so on commercially viable term or if these operator were to terminate their agreement sky may be unable to deliver certain of it service to customer in one or more of the market in which it operates which would adversely affect sky business and result of operation our business depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property right and on not infringing the intellectual property right of others we rely on our intellectual property such patent copyright trademark and trade secret well license and other agreement with our vendor and other third party to use various technology conduct our business operation and sell our product and service legal challenge to our intellectual property right and claim of intellectual property infringement by third party could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreement on unfavorable term incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question from importing into the united state or other jurisdiction in which we operate hardware or software that us such intellectual property or from the continuation of our business currently conducted we may need to change our business practice if any of these event occur which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our result of operation even if we believe any such challenge or claim are without merit they can be time consuming costly to defend and may divert management attention and resource away from our business moreover if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain license from our vendor and other third party on reasonable term our business could be adversely affected in addition intellectual property constitutes significant part of the value of nbcuniversal and sky business and their success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property right of the content they create or acquire against third party misappropriation reproduction or infringement the unauthorized reproduction distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affect our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content well from the sale of advertising in connection with our content and increase our cost due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property right piracy and other unauthorized us of content are made easier and the enforcement of intellectual property right more challenging by technological advance that allow the conversion of programming film and other content into digital format which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of high quality unauthorized copy in particular piracy of programming and film through unauthorized distribution platform continues to present challenge for nbcuniversal business and certain entity may stream our broadcast television content illegally online without our consent and without paying any compensation it also present similar challenge for sky business including result of illegal retransmission of sport event while piracy is challenge in the united state it is particularly prevalent in many part of the world that lack developed copyright law effective enforcement of copyright law and technical protective measure like those in effect in the united state if any or international law intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property right are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technology that facilitate piracy we may be unable to effectively protect our right the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our cost of enforcing our right may increase annual report on form ktable of contentswe may be unable to obtain necessary hardware software and operational support we depend on third party vendor to supply with significant amount of the hardware software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our product and service some of these vendor represent our primary source of supply or grant the

potential difficulty there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulty associated with these vendor or that we could effectively mitigate our risk with respect to any such difficulty if any of these vendor experience operating or financial difficulty or any other supply chain compliance related issue if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they breach or terminate their agreement with or are otherwise unable to meet our specification or provide the equipment product or service we need in timely manner or at all or at reasonable price our ability to provide some product or service may be adversely affected and we may incur additional cost our business depend on keeping pace with technological development our success is to large extent dependent on our ability to acquire develop adopt and leverage new and existing technology and our competitor use of certain type of technology and equipment may provide them with competitive advantage new technology can materially impact our business in number of way including affecting the demand for our product the distribution method of our product and content to our customer the way in which our customer can purchase and view our content and the growth of distribution platform available to advertiser for example current and new wireless internet technology including and wireless broadband service and fixed wireless network continue to evolve rapidly and may allow for greater speed and reliability for those service compared with prior technology in addition some company and municipality are building advanced fiber based network that provide very fast internet access speed we expect advance in communication technology to continue to occur in the future if we choose technology or equipment that is not effective or attractive to consumer that employed by our competitor if we fail to employ technology desired by consumer before our competitor do so or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiative our business and result of operation could be adversely affected we also will continue to incur additional cost we execute our technology initiative such the deployment of multigigabit symmetrical speed by leveraging our docsis technology and the development and enhancement of various streaming platform there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiative in manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to successfully compete in the future we also may generate le revenue or incur increased cost if change in our competitor product offering require that we offer certain service or enhancement at lower or no cost to our customer or that we increase our research and development expenditure cyber attack information or security breach or technology disruption or failure may negatively impact our ability to conduct our business or result in the misuse of confidential information all of which could adversely affect our business reputation and result of operation network and information system and other technology including those that are related to our network management customer service operation and programming delivery and are embedded in our product and service are critical to our business activity in the ordinary course of our business there are constant attempt by third party to cause system related event and security incident and to identify and exploit vulnerability in security architecture and system design these incident include computer hackings cyber attack computer virus worm or other destructive or disruptive software denial of service attack phishing attack malicious social engineering and other malicious activity incident also may be caused inadvertently by or our third party vendor such process breakdown and vulnerability in security architecture or system design cyber threat and attack are constantly evolving and are growing in sophistication and frequency which increase the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them some cyber attack have had and in the future can have cascading impact that unfold with increasing speed across network information system and other technology across the world and create latent vulnerability in our and third party vendor system and other technology moreover we also obtain certain confidential proprietary and personal information about our customer personnel and vendor and in some case provide this information to third party vendor who agree to protect it we face the risk that this information may become compromised through cyber attack or data breach misappropriation misuse leakage falsification or accidental release or loss of information due to the nature of our business we may be at disproportionately heightened risk of these type of incident occurring because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form we also incorporate third

perform our business operation all of which expose to cyber attack on such third party supplier and service provider comcast annual report on form of contentswhile we develop and maintain system and operate extensive program that seek to prevent security incident from occurring these effort are costly and must be constantly monitored and updated in the face of sophisticated and rapidly evolving

cover our loss or otherwise adequately compensate for disruption to our business that may result in addition any such event could lead to litigation or cause regulator in the united state and internationally to impose significant fine or other remedial measure including with respect to relevant customer privacy rule or otherwise have an adverse effect on our company despite our effort we

distributor retailer and content creator among others to satisfy their obligation to acquisition and other strategic initiative present many risk and we may not realize the financial and strategic goal that we had contemplated from time to time we make acquisition and investment and may pursue other strategic initiative such peacock in connection with such acquisition and strategic initiative we may incur significant or unanticipated expense fail to realize anticipated benefit and synergy have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business disrupt relationship with current

and other circumstance could also result in the impairment of goodwill and long lived asset additionally federal regulatory or antitrust agency such the fcc or doj or international regulator may impose restriction on the operation of our business result of our seeking regulatory approval for any significant acquisition and strategic initiative or may dissuade from pursuing certain transaction the occurrence of any of these event could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation annual report on form ktable of contentswe face risk relating to business internationally that

display and sale of advertising import or export restriction tariff sanction and trade regulation difficulty in developing staffing and managing foreign operation issue related to occupational safety

accounting judgment and estimate with the audit committee of our board of director and the audit committee ha reviewed the related disclosure below see also note and valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rightswe ass the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset including cable franchise right annually of july or more frequently whenever event or substantive change in circumstance indicate that the asset might be impaired the assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factor to determine whether the existence of event or circumstance lead to determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit or an indefinite lived intangible asset is le than it carrying amount quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment result in more likely than not determination or if qualitative assessment is not performed in connection with our impairment assessment process in order to support our qualitative assessment we typically perform quantitative assessment of our cable franchise right and reporting unit approximately once every four year goodwillgoodwill result from business combination and represents the excess amount of the consideration paid over the identifiable asset and liability recorded in the acquisition we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have concluded that our reporting unit are generally the same our reportable segment we evaluate the determination of our reporting unit periodically or whenever event or substantive change in circumstance occur when performing quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit primarily based on discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment including market participant estimate of future cash flow expected to be generated by the business and the selection of discount rate when performing this analysis we also consider multiple of earnings from comparable public company and recent market transaction pursuant to our practice of performing quantitative assessment of our reporting unit approximately once every four year our current year impairment testing for goodwill in our cable communication and nbcuniversal segment wa based on quantitative assessment based on these assessment the estimated fair value of these reporting unit substantially exceeded their carrying value and no impairment wa required the goodwill in our sky segment resulted from our acquisition of sky in the fourth quarter of and ha been in close proximity to it carrying value we performed quantitative assessment for goodwill in our sky reporting unit in the current year and determined that the fair value had declined resulting in an impairment of billion see note in preparing the quantitative assessment we estimated the fair value of the sky reporting unit using discounted cash flow analysis the significant judgment in the discounted cash flow analysis for the sky reporting unit included estimated future cash flow generated by the business including the estimated impact of macroeconomic condition in the sky territory and the selection of the discount rate which increased by basis point compared to the analysis in we evaluated the fair value indicated under the discounted cash flow model considering multiple of earnings from comparable public company and recent market transaction change in market condition law and regulation and key assumption made in future quantitative assessment including expected cash flow competitive factor and discount rate could negatively impact the result of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an additional impairment charge cable franchise rightsour cable franchise right asset result from agreement we have with state and local government that allow to construct and operate cable business within specified geographic area the value of franchise is derived from the economic benefit we receive from the right to solicit new customer and to market additional service in particular service area the amount we record for cable franchise right are primarily result of cable system acquisition typically when we acquire cable system the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise right often these cable system acquisition include multiple franchise area we currently serve more than franchise area in the united state we have concluded that our cable franchise right have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factor that limit the period over which these right will contribute to our cash flow accordingly we do not amortize our cable franchise right for purpose of impairment testing we have grouped the recorded value of our various cable franchise right into our three cable communication division or unit of account we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level annual report on form ktable of contentswhen performing quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise right primarily based on discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment including the estimate of future cash flow and the selection of discount rate pursuant to our practice of performing quantitative assessment of cable franchise right approximately once every four year our current year impairment testing wa based on quantitative assessment based on this assessment the estimated fair value of our franchise right substantially exceeded their carrying value and no impairment wa required change in market condition law and regulation and key assumption made in future quantitative assessment including expected cash flow competitive factor and discount rate could negatively impact the result of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge film and television contentwe capitalize cost for owned film and television content including direct cost production overhead print cost development cost and interest well acquired library we have determined that the predominant monetization strategy for the substantial majority of our content is on an individual basis amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued cost associated with participation and residual payment are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method which recognizes the cost in the same ratio the associated ultimate revenue our estimate of ultimate revenue for film generally include revenue from all source that are expected to be earned within year from the date of film initial release these estimate are based on the distribution strategy and historical performance of similar content well factor unique to the content the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for film intended for theatrical release is the film theatrical performance subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of film ha historically exhibited high correlation to it theatrical performance upon film release our estimate of revenue from succeeding market including from content licensing across multiple platform and home entertainment sale are revised based on historical relationship and an analysis of current market trend with respect to television series or other owned television programming the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond it initial license window initial estimate of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue attributed to the initial license window once it is determined that television series or other owned television programming can be licensed beyond the initial license window revenue estimate for these additional window or platform such and international syndication home entertainment and other distribution platform are included in ultimate revenue revenue estimate for produced episode include revenue expected to be earned within year of delivery of the initial episode or if still in production year from the delivery of the most recent episode if later we capitalize the cost of licensed content when the license period begin the content is made available for use and the cost of the license are known licensed content is amortized the associated program are used incorporating estimated viewing pattern we recognize the cost of multiyear live event sport right the right are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value estimated relative value is generally based on term of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverable within the contract capitalized film and television cost are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering event are identified the substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis licensed content that is not part of film group is tested for impairment primarily on channel network or platform basis with the exception of our broadcast network and owned local broadcast television station which are tested on daypart basis sport right are accounted for executory contract and are not subject to impairment when performing an impairment assessment we estimate fair value primarily based on discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment including
