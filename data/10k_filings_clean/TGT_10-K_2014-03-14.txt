business is subject to many risk set forth are the significant risk that we face if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailer our result of operation could be adversely affected the retail business is highly competitive in the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guest shopping experience by creating an attractive value proposition through careful combination of price merchandise assortment convenience guest service loyalty program and marketing effort our ability to create personalized guest experience through the collection and use of guest data is increasingly important to our ability to differentiate from other retailer guest perception regarding the cleanliness and safety of our store the functionality and reliability of our digital channel our in stock level and other factor also affect our ability to compete no single competitive factor is dominant and action by our competitor on any of these factor could have an adverse effect on our sale gross margin and expense we sell many product under our owned and exclusive brand these brand are an important part of our business because differentiate from other retailer generally carry higher margin equivalent national brand product and represent significant portion of our overall sale if one or more of these brand experience loss of consumer acceptance or confidence our sale and gross margin could be adversely affected the continuing migration and evolution of retailing to online and mobile channel ha increased our challenge in differentiating ourselves from other retailer in particular consumer are able to quickly and conveniently comparison shop with digital tool which lead to decision based solely on price we work with our vendor to offer unique and distinctive merchandise and encourage our guest to shop with confidence with our price match policy failure to effectively execute in these effort action by our competitor in response to these effort or failure of our vendor to manage their channel and content could hurt our ability to differentiate ourselves from other retailer and result have an adverse effect on sale gross margin and expense our continued success is substantially dependent on positive perception of target which if eroded could adversely affect our business and our relationship with our guest and team member we believe that one of the reason our guest prefer to shop at target and our team member choose target place of employment is the reputation we have built many year for serving our four primary constituency guest team member the community in which we operate and shareholder to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve grow and leverage the value of target reputation reputational value is based in large part on perception while reputation may take decade to build any negative incident can quickly erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social medium publicity governmental investigation or litigation those type of incident could have an adverse impact on perception and lead to tangible adverse effect on our business including consumer boycott lost sale loss of new store development opportunity or team member retention and recruiting difficulty for example we experienced weaker than expected segment sale following the announcement of the data breach and are unable to determine whether will be long term impact to our relationship with our guest and whether we will need to engage in significant promotional or other activity to regain their trust if we are unable to successfully develop and maintain relevant and reliable multichannel experience for our guest our sale result of operation and reputation could be adversely affected our business ha evolved from an in store experience to interaction with guest across multiple channel in store online mobile and social medium among others our guest are using computer tablet mobile phone and other device to shop in our store and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspect of our business we currently provide full and mobile version of our website target com application for mobile phone and tablet and interact with our guest through social medium multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing guest expectation and new development and technology investment by our competitor if we are unable to attract and retain team member or contract with third party the specialized skill needed to support our multichannel effort implement improvement to our guest facing technology in timely manner or provide convenient and consistent experience for our guest regardless of the ultimate sale channel our ability to compete and our result of operation could be adversely affected in addition if target com and our other guest facing technology system do not appeal to our guest or reliably function designed we may experience loss of guest lost sale or be exposed to fraudulent purchase which if significant could adversely affect our reputation and result of operation if we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preference our sale gross margin and profitability could suffer substantial part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend right decision and effectively manage our inventory in broad range of merchandise category including apparel home décor seasonal offering food and other merchandise failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer taste preference spending pattern and other lifestyle decision and personalize our offering to our guest may result in lost sale spoilage and increased inventory markdowns which would lead to deterioration in our result of operation by hurting our sale gross margin and profitability our earnings are highly susceptible to the state of macroeconomic condition and consumer confidence in the united state most of our store and all of our digital sale are in the united state making our result highly dependent on consumer confidence and the health of the economy in addition significant portion of our total sale is derived from store located in five state california texas florida minnesota and illinois resulting in further dependence on local economic condition in these state deterioration in macroeconomic condition or consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many way including slowing sale growth or reduction in overall sale and reducing gross margin these consideration impact the success of our credit card program even though we no longer own consumer credit card receivables portfolio we share in the economic performance of the credit card program with td deterioration in macroeconomic condition could adversely affect the volume of new credit account the amount of credit card program balance and the ability of credit card holder to pay their balance these condition could result in receiving lower profit sharing payment we rely on large global and changing workforce of target team member contractor and temporary staffing if we do not effectively manage our workforce and the concentration of work in certain global location our labor cost and result of operation could be adversely affected with approximately team member our workforce cost represent our largest operating expense and our business is dependent on our ability to attract train and retain the appropriate mix of qualified team member contractor and temporary staffing many team member are in entry level or part time position with historically high turnover rate our ability to meet our labor need while controlling our cost is subject to external factor such unemployment level prevailing wage rate collective bargaining effort health care and other benefit cost and changing demographic if we are unable to attract and retain adequate number and an appropriate mix of qualified team member contractor and temporary staffing our operation guest service level and support function could suffer those factor together with increasing wage and benefit cost could adversely affect our result of operation of march none of our team member were working under collective bargaining agreement we are periodically subject to labor organizing effort if we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreement in the future it could adversely affect our labor cost and we operate our business we have concentration of support function located in india there ha been greater political financial environmental and health instability than the united state an extended disruption of our operation in india could adversely affect certain operation supporting stability and maintenance of our digital channel and information technology development if our capital investment in technology new store and remodeling existing store do not achieve appropriate return our competitive position financial condition and result of operation may be adversely affected our business is becoming increasingly reliant on technology investment and the return on these investment are le predictable than building new store and remodeling existing store we are currently making and will continue to make significant technology investment to support our multichannel effort implement improvement to our guest facing technology and transform our information process and computer system to more efficiently run our business and remain competitive and relevant to our guest these technology initiative might not provide the anticipated benefit or may provide on delayed schedule or at higher cost we must monitor and choose the right investment and implement them at the right pace targeting the wrong opportunity failing to make the best or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our need could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition or result of operation in addition our growth also depends in part on our ability to build new store and remodel existing store in manner that achieves appropriate return on our capital investment we compete with other retailer and business for suitable location for our store many of our expected new store site are located in fully developed market which are generally more time consuming and expensive undertaking than expansion into undeveloped suburban and ex urban market interruption in our supply chain or increased commodity price and supply chain cost could adversely affect our gross margin expense and result of operation we are dependent on our vendor to supply merchandise in timely and efficient manner if vendor fails to deliver on it commitment whether due to financial difficulty or other reason we could experience merchandise of stock that could lead to lost sale in addition large portion of our merchandise is sourced directly or indirectly from outside the united state with china our single largest source political or financial instability trade restriction the outbreak of pandemic labor unrest transport capacity and cost port security weather condition natural disaster or other event that could slow port activity and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of merchandise and or adversely affect our result of operation in addition change in the cost of procuring commodity used in our merchandise or the cost related to our supply chain including vendor cost labor fuel tariff currency exchange rate and supply chain transparency initiative could have an adverse effect on gross margin expense and result of operation failure to address product safety concern could adversely affect our sale and result of operation if our merchandise offering including food drug and child product do not meet applicable safety standard or our guest expectation regarding safety we could experience lost sale and increased cost and be exposed to legal and reputational risk all of our vendor must comply with applicable product safety law and we are dependent on them to ensure that the product we buy comply with all safety standard event that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concern including food or drug contamination could expose to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recall and other liability in addition negative guest perception regarding the safety of the product we sell could cause our guest to seek alternative source for their need resulting in lost sale in those circumstance it may be difficult and costly for to regain the confidence of our guest the data breach we experienced in ha resulted in government inquiry and private litigation and if our effort to protect the security of information about our guest and team member are unsuccessful future issue may result in additional costly government enforcement action and private litigation and our sale and reputation could suffer the nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of information about our guest and team member we have program in place to detect and respond to data security incident however because the technique used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage system change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long period of time we may be unable to anticipate these technique or implement adequate preventive measure in addition hardware software or application we develop or procure from third party may contain defect in design or manufacture or other problem that could unexpectedly compromise information security unauthorized party may also attempt to gain access to our system or facility through fraud trickery or other form of deceiving our team member contractor and temporary staff the fourth quarter of all incident we experienced were insignificant the data breach we experienced wa significant and went undetected for several week we experienced weaker than expected segment sale immediately following the announcement of the data breach and we are currently facing more than civil lawsuit filed on behalf of guest payment card issuing bank and shareholder in addition state and federal agency including state attorney general the federal trade commission and the sec are investigating event related to the data breach including how it occurred it consequence and our response those claim and investigation may have an adverse effect on how we operate our business and our result of operation if we experience additional significant data security breach or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breach we could be exposed to additional government enforcement action and private litigation in addition our guest could further lose confidence in our ability to protect their information which could cause them to discontinue using our redcards or pharmacy service or stop shopping with altogether failure to comply with federal state local and international law or change in these law could increase our cost reduce our margin and lower our sale our business is subject to wide array of law and regulation in the united state canada and other country in which we operate significant workforce related legislative change could increase our expense and adversely affect our operation example of possible workforce related legislative change include change to an employer obligation to recognize collective bargaining unit the process by which collective bargaining agreement are negotiated or imposed minimum wage requirement and health care mandate in addition change in the regulatory environment affecting medicare reimbursement privacy and information security product safety supply chain transparency or environmental protection among others could cause our expense to increase without an ability to pas through any increased expense through higher price for example we are currently facing government inquiry related to the data breach that may result in the imposition of fine or other penalty in addition any legislative or regulatory change adopted in reaction to the recent retail industry data breach could increase or accelerate our compliance cost also our pharmacy and clinic operation are governed by various regulation and significant change in or our noncompliance with these regulation could have material adverse effect on our compliance cost and result of operation in addition if we fail to comply with other applicable law and regulation including wage and hour law the foreign corrupt practice act and local anti bribery law we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our result of operation by increasing our cost reducing our margin and lowering our sale weather condition where our store are located may impact consumer shopping pattern which alone or together with natural disaster particularly in area where our sale are concentrated could adversely affect our result of operation uncharacteristic or significant weather condition can affect consumer shopping pattern particularly in apparel and seasonal item which could lead to lost sale or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our short term result of operation in addition our three largest state by total sale are california texas and florida area where natural disaster are more prevalent natural disaster in those state or in other area where our sale are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our store or distribution center and cause delay in the distribution of merchandise from our vendor to our distribution center and store which could adversely affect our result of operation by increasing our cost and lowering our sale change in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our net income number of factor influence our effective income tax rate including change in tax law tax treaty interpretation of existing law and our ability to sustain our reporting position on examination change in any of those factor could change our effective tax rate which could adversely affect our net income in addition our operation outside of the united state may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate if we are unable to access the capital market or obtain bank credit our financial position liquidity and result of operation could suffer we are dependent on stable liquid and well functioning financial system to fund our operation and capital investment in particular we have historically relied on the public debt market to fund portion of our capital investment and the commercial paper market and bank credit facility to fund seasonal need for working capital our continued access to these market depends on multiple factor including the condition of debt capital market our operating performance and maintaining strong debt rating if rating agency lower our credit rating it could adversely impact our ability to access the debt market our cost of fund and other term for new debt issuance each of the credit rating agency review it rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same in addition we use variety of derivative product to manage our exposure to market risk principally interest rate and equity price fluctuation disruption or turmoil in the financial market could reduce our ability to meet our capital requirement or fund our working capital need and lead to loss on derivative position resulting from counterparty failure which could adversely affect our financial position and result of operation significant disruption in our computer system and our inability to adequately maintain and update those system could adversely affect our operation and our ability to maintain guest confidence we rely extensively on our computer system to manage inventory process guest transaction manage guest data communicate with our vendor and other third party service redcard account and summarize and analyze result and on continued and unimpeded access to the internet to use our computer system our system are subject to or interruption from power outage telecommunication failure computer virus and malicious attack security breach and catastrophic event if our system are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial repair or replacement cost experience data loss and impediment to our ability to manage inventory or process guest transaction and encounter lost guest confidence which could adversely affect our result of operation the data breach we experienced negatively impacted our ability to timely handle customer inquiry and we experienced weaker than expected segment sale following the announcement of the data breach we continually make significant technology investment that will help maintain and update our existing computer system implementing significant system change increase the risk of computer system disruption additionally the potential problem and interruption associated with implementing technology initiative could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency and could impact the guest experience and guest confidence if we do not positively differentiate the target experience and appeal to our new canadian guest our financial result could be adversely affected in fiscal we opened target store in canada which wa our first retail store expansion outside of the united state our initial sale and operating result in canada have not met our initial expectation improving our sale in canada is contingent on our ability to deploy new marketing program that positively differentiate from other retailer in canada and achieve market acceptance by canadian guest in addition our sale and operating result in canada are dependent on our ability to manage our inventory to offer the expected assortment of merchandise to our canadian guest while avoiding overstock situation and general macroeconomic condition in canada if we do not effectively execute our marketing program and manage our inventory in canada our financial result could be adversely affected disruption in relationship with third party provide service in connection with certain aspect of our business could adversely affect our operation we rely on third party to support variety of business function including our canadian supply chain portion of our technology development and system our multichannel platform and distribution network operation credit and debit card transaction processing and extension of credit for our redcard reward loyalty program if we are unable to contract with third party having the specialized skill needed to support those strategy or integrate their product and service with our business or if those third party fail to meet our performance standard and expectation including with respect to data security our reputation sale and result of operation could be adversely affected in addition we could face increased cost associated with finding replacement provider or hiring new team member to provide these service in house we experienced significant data security breach in the fourth quarter of fiscal and are not yet able to determine the full extent of it impact and the impact of government investigation and private litigation on our result of operation which could be material the data breach we experienced involved the theft of certain payment card and guest information through unauthorized access to our network our investigation of the matter is ongoing and it is possible that we will identify additional information that wa accessed or stolen which could materially worsen the loss and reputational damage we have experienced for example the intrusion wa initially identified we thought the information stolen wa limited to payment card information but later discovered that other guest information wa also stolen we are currently subject to number of governmental investigation and private litigation and other claim relating to the data breach and in the future we may be subject to additional investigation and claim of this sort these investigation and claim could have material adverse impact on our result of operation or profitability our financial liability arising from such investigation and claim will depend on many factor one of which is whether at the time of the data breach the portion of our network that handle payment card data wa in compliance with applicable payment card industry standard while that portion of our network wa determined to be compliant by an independent third party assessor in the fall of we expect the forensic investigator working on behalf of the payment card network to claim that we were not in compliance another factor is whether and if to extent any fraud loss or other expense experienced by cardholder card issuer and or the payment card network on or with respect to the payment card account affected by the data breach can be properly attributed to the data breach and whether and if so to what extent it would in any event be our legal responsibility in addition the governmental agency investigating the data breach may seek to impose on fine and or other monetary relief and or injunctive relief that could materially increase our data security cost adversely impact how we operate our network and collect and use guest information and put at competitive disadvantage with other retailer we believe that the greatest risk to our business arising out of the data breach is the negative impact on our reputation and loss of confidence of our guest well the possibility of decreased participation in our redcards reward loyalty program which our internal analysis ha indicated drive meaningful incremental sale we experienced weaker than expected segment sale after the announcement of the data breach but are unable to determine whether there will be long term impact to our relationship with our guest or whether we will need to engage in significant promotional or other activity to regain their trust which could have material adverse impact on our

enforcement effort to identify the responsible party expense incurred and amount accrued in the fourth quarter of we recorded million of pretax data breach related expense and expected insurance proceeds of million for net expense of million million after tax or per diluted share these expense were included in our consolidated statement of operation selling general and administrative expense sg but were not part of our segment result expense include cost to investigate the data breach provide credit monitoring service to our guest increase staffing in our call center and procure legal and other professional service the million of fourth quarter expense also includes an accrual related to the expected payment card network claim by reason of the data breach the ultimate amount of these claim will likely include amount for incremental counterfeit fraud loss and non ordinary course operating expense such card reissuance cost that the payment card network believe they or their issuing bank have incurred in order for to have liability for such claim we believe that court would have to find among other thing that at the time of the data breach the portion of our network that handle payment card data wa noncompliant with applicable data security standard in manner that contributed to the data breach and the network operating rule around reimbursement of operating cost and counterfeit fraud loss are enforceable while an independent third party assessor found the portion of our network that handle payment card data to be compliant with applicable data security standard in the fall of we expect the forensic investigator working on behalf of the payment card network nonetheless to claim that we were not in compliance with those standard at the time of the data breach we base that expectation on our understanding that in case like where prior to data breach the entity suffering the breach been found by an independent third party assessor to be fully compliant with those standard the network approved forensic investigator nonetheless regularly claim that the breached entity wa not in fact compliant with those standard result we believe it is probable that the payment card network will make claim we expect to dispute the payment card network anticipated claim and we think it is likely that our dispute would lead to settlement negotiation consistent with the experience of other entity that have suffered similar payment card breach we believe such negotiation would effect combined settlement of both the payment card network counterfeit fraud loss allegation and their non ordinary course operating expense allegation we based our year end accrual on the expectation of reaching negotiated settlement of the payment card network anticipated claim and not on any determination that it is probable we would be found liable on these claim were they to be litigated currently we can only reasonably estimate loss associated with settlement of the network expected claim for non ordinary course operating expense the year end accrual not include any amount associated with the network expected claim for alleged incremental counterfeit fraud loss because the loss associated with settling such claim while probable in our judgment is not reasonably estimable in part because we have not yet received third party fraud reporting from the payment card network we are not able to reasonably estimate range of possible loss in excess of the year end accrual related to the expected settlement of the payment card network claim because the investigation into the matter is ongoing and there are significant factual and legal issue to be resolved we believe that the ultimate amount paid on payment card network claim could be material to our result of operation in future period and governmental investigationsin addition more than action have been filed in court in many state and other claim have been or may be asserted against on behalf of guest payment card issuing bank shareholder or others seeking damage or other related relief allegedly arising out of the data breach state and federal agency including the state attorney general the federal trade commission and the sec are investigating event related to the data breach including how it occurred it consequence and our response although we are cooperating in these investigation we may be subject to fine or other obligation which may have an adverse effect on how we operate our business and our result of operation while loss from these matter is reasonably possible we can not reasonably estimate range of possible loss because our investigation into the matter is ongoing the proceeding remain in the early stage alleged damage have not been specified there is uncertainty to the likelihood of class or class being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified and there are significant factual and legal issue to be resolved further we do not believe that loss from these matter is probable therefore we have not recorded loss contingency liability for litigation claim and governmental investigation in the fourth quarter see note of the note to consolidated financial statement included in item financial statement and supplementary data future costswe expect to incur significant investigation legal and professional service expense associated with the data breach in future period we will recognize these expense service are received we also expect to incur additional expense associated with incremental fraud and reissuance cost on target redcards insurance coverageto limit our exposure to data breach loss we maintain million of network security insurance coverage above million deductible this coverage and certain other insurance coverage may reduce our exposure we will pursue recovery to the maximum extent available under the policy of february we have recorded million receivable for cost we believe are reimbursable and probable of recovery under our insurance coverage which partially offset the million of expense relating to the data breach future capital investmentswe plan to accelerate previously planned investment of approximately million to equip our proprietary redcards and all of our store card reader with chip enabled smart card technology by the first quarter of in addition we may accelerate or make additional investment in our information technology system but we are unable to estimate such investment because the nature and scope ha not yet been determined we do not expect such amount to be material to any fiscal period effect on sale and guest loyaltywe believe the data breach adversely affected our fourth quarter segment sale prior to our december announcement of the data breach our segment fourth quarter comparable sale were positive followed by meaningfully negative comparable sale result following the announcement comparable sale began to recover in january the collective interaction of year over year change in the retail calendar the number of day between thanksgiving and christmas combined with the broad array of competitive consumer behavioral and weather factor

received included cash of billion equal to the gross par value of the receivables at the time of closing and million beneficial interest asset the beneficial interest asset effectively represents

discretionary amount determined to be appropriate off balance sheet arrangement other than the unrecorded contractual obligation above we do not have any arrangement or relationship with entity that are not consolidated into the financial statement critical accounting estimatesour analysis of operation and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statement prepared in accordance with gaap preparation of these consolidated financial statement requires to make estimate and assumption affecting the reported amount of asset and liability at the date of the consolidated financial statement reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period and related disclosure of contingent asset liability in the note to consolidated financial statement we describe the significant accounting policy used in preparing the consolidated financial statement our estimate are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance actual result could differ under other assumption or condition however we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in future estimate or assumption our senior management ha discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of director the following item in our consolidated financial statement require significant estimation or judgment inventory and cost of sale we use the retail inventory method to account for the majority of our inventory and the related cost of sale under this method inventory is stated at cost using the last in first out lifo method determined by applying cost to retail ratio to each merchandise grouping ending retail value the cost of our inventory includes the amount we pay to our supplier to acquire inventory freight cost incurred in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution center and store and import cost reduced by vendor income and cash discount the majority of our distribution center operating cost including compensation and benefit are expensed to cost of sale in the period incurred since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market condition our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market we reduce inventory for estimated loss related to shrink and markdowns our shrink estimate is based on historical loss verified by physical inventory count historically our actual physical inventory count result have shown our estimate to be reliable markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise ha diminished inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic condition change including changing consumer demand guest preference changing consumer credit market or increasing competition we believe these risk are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turn in le than three month inventory wa million and million at february and february respectively and is further described in note of the note to consolidated financial statement vendor income receivable cost of sale and sg expense are partially offset by various form of consideration received from our vendor this vendor income is earned for variety of vendor sponsored program such volume rebate markdown allowance promotion and advertising allowance well for our compliance program we establish receivable for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on the agreement in place this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned the majority of all year end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that the assumption used in our estimate will change significantly historically adjustment to our vendor income receivable have not been material vendor income receivable wa million and million at february and february respectively and is described further in note of the note to consolidated financial statement long lived asset long lived asset are reviewed for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flow independent of other asset an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flow from the operation and or disposition of the asset are le than their carrying amount measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over it fair value fair value is measured using discounted cash flow or independent opinion of value appropriate we recorded impairment of million million and million in and respectively and are described further in note of february percent decrease in the fair value of asset we intend to sell or close would result in additional impairment of million in historically we have not realized material loss upon sale of long lived asset insurance self insurance we retain substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability worker compensation property loss and team member medical and dental claim however we maintain stop loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risk liability associated with these loss include estimate of both claim filed and loss incurred but not yet reported we use actuarial method which consider number of factor to estimate our ultimate cost of loss general liability and worker compensation liability are recorded at our estimate of their net present value other liability referred to above are not discounted our worker compensation and general liability accrual wa million and million at february and february respectively we believe that the amount accrued are appropriate however our liability could be significantly affected if future occurrence or loss development differ from our assumption for example percent increase or decrease in average claim cost would impact our self insurance expense by million in historically adjustment to our estimate have not been material refer to item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk for further disclosure of the market risk associated with these exposure we maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain event including network security matter of february we have recognized million insurance recovery receivable relating to the data breach because we believe recovery is probable however it is possible that the insurance carrier could dispute our claim and that we may be unable to collect the recorded receivable tax we pay income tax based on the tax statute regulation and case law of the various jurisdiction in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amount of deductible and taxable item and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matter in dispute with tax authority the benefit of uncertain tax position are recorded in our financial statement only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax position would withstand challenge by taxing authority we periodically reassess these probability and record any change in the financial statement appropriate liability for uncertain tax position including interest and penalty were million and million at february and february respectively we believe the resolution of these matter will not have material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statement of february we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of million which are available to offset future income these carryforwards are primarily related to the start up operation of the canadian segment and expire between and we establish valuation allowance for any portion of our deferred tax asset that we believe will not be realized we have evaluated the positive and negative evidence and consider it more likely than not that these carryforwards will be fully utilized prior to expiration therefore we have not established valuation allowance income tax are described further in note of the note to consolidated financial statement pension and postretirement health care accounting we maintain funded qualified defined benefit pension plan well several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plan and postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team member the cost for these plan are determined based on actuarial calculation using the assumption described in the following paragraph eligibility and the level of benefit varies depending on team member full time or part time status date of hire and or length of service the benefit obligation and related expense for these plan are determined based on actuarial calculation using assumption about the expected long term rate of return the discount rate and compensation growth rate the assumption used to determine the period end benefit obligation also establish the expense for the next year with adjustment made for any significant plan or participant change our expected long term rate of return on plan asset of percent is determined by the portfolio composition historical long term investment performance and current market condition our compound annual rate of return on qualified plan asset wa percent percent percent and percent for the year year year and year period respectively one percentage point decrease in our expected long term rate of return would increase annual expense by million the discount rate used to determine benefit obligation is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bond using yield for maturity that are in line with the duration of our pension liability our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with change in interest rate percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million based on our experience we use graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger shorter service pension eligible team member than it doe for older longer service pension eligible team member pension and postretirement health care benefit are further described in note of the note to consolidated financial statement legal and other contingency we are exposed to other claim and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various method to resolve these matter in manner that we believe serf the best interest of our shareholder and other constituent when loss is probable we record an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss when no point of loss is more likely than another we record the lowest amount in the estimated range of loss and disclose the estimated range we do not record liability for reasonably possible loss contingency but do disclose range of reasonably possible loss if they are material and we are able to estimate such range if we can not provide range of reasonably possible loss we explain the factor that prevent from determining such range historically adjustment to our estimate have not been material we believe the accrual recorded in our consolidated financial statement properly reflect loss exposure that are both probable and reasonably estimable with the exception of data breach related loss exposure we do not believe any of the currently identified claim or litigation will materially affect our result of operation cash flow or financial condition however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainty and unfavorable ruling could occur if an unfavorable ruling were to occur it may cause material adverse impact on the result of operation cash flow or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs or future period for data breach related exposure we are unable to reasonably estimate range of probable loss in excess of the recorded payment card network contingent loss we believe that loss from the payment card network in excess of the amount recorded in fiscal are reasonably possible and that these loss could be material to our result of operation in future period but we are unable to estimate range of such reasonably possible we are also unable to estimate range of reasonably possible loss arising from data breach related litigation and governmental investigation see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation and note of the note to the consolidated financial statement included in item financial statement and supplementary data for further information on the data breach related contingency new accounting pronouncementswe do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncement will have material effect on our financial statement forward looking statementsthis report contains forward looking statement which are based on our current assumption and expectation these statement are typically accompanied by the word expect may could believe would might anticipates or word of similar import the principal forward looking statement in this report include our financial performance statement regarding the adequacy of and cost associated with our source of liquidity the fair value and amount of the beneficial interest asset the continued execution of our share repurchase program our expected capital expenditure the impact of change in the expected effective income tax rate on net income the expected compliance with

to recognize deferred tax asset and liability including foreign net operating loss carryforwards and the resolution of tax matter all such forward looking statement are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statement contained in the private security litigation reform act of amended although we believe there is reasonable basis for the forward looking statement our actual result could be materially different the most important factor which could cause our actual result to differ from our forward looking statement are set forth on our description of risk factor in item to this form which should be read in conjunction with the forward looking statement in this report forward looking statement speak only of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskat february our exposure to market risk wa primarily from interest rate change on our debt obligation of which are at libor plus floating rate our interest rate exposure is primarily due to the extent by which our floating rate debt obligation differ from our floating rate short term investment at february our floating rate debt exceeded our floating rate short term investment by approximately billion result based on our balance sheet position at february the annualized effect of percentage point increase in floating interest rate on our floating rate debt obligation net of our short term investment would be to decrease earnings before income tax by approximately million in general we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short term investment over time but that may vary in different interest rate environment see further description of our debt and derivative instrument in note and of the note to consolidated financial statement we record our general liability and worker compensation liability at net present value therefore these liability fluctuate with change in interest rate periodically in certain interest rate environment we economically hedge portion of our exposure to these interest rate change by

decrease in interest rate would be to decrease earnings before income tax by million in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuation on our qualified defined benefit pension plan percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million the value of our pension liability is inversely related to change in interest rate to protect against

more fully described in note and note of the note to consolidated financial statement we are exposed to market return on accumulated team member balance in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan we control the risk of offering the nonqualified plan by making investment in life insurance contract and prepaid forward contract on our own common stock that offset substantial portion of our economic exposure to the return on these plan the annualized effect of one percentage point change in market return on our nonqualified defined contribution plan inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicle used to manage our economic exposure would not be significant there have been no other material change in our primary risk exposure or management of market risk since the

connection with operating lease see footnote to the other noncurrent liability table in note for additional detail commitment and contingenciesdata breachin the fourth quarter of we experienced data breach in which an intruder stole certain payment card and other guest information from our network the data breach based on our investigation to date we believe that the intruder accessed and stole payment card data from approximately million credit and debit card account of guest who shopped at our store between november and december through malware installed on our point of sale system in our store on december we removed the malware from virtually all register in our store payment card data used in transaction made by additional guest in the period between december and december wa stolen prior to our disabling malware on one additional register that wa disconnected from our system when we completed the initial malware removal on december in addition the intruder stole certain guest information including name mailing address phone number or email address for up to million individual our investigation of the matter is ongoing and we are supporting law enforcement effort to identify the responsible party expense incurred and amount accrued in the fourth quarter of we recorded million of pretax data breach related expense and expected insurance proceeds of million for net expense of million million after tax or per diluted share these expense were included in our consolidated statement of operation selling general and administrative expense sg but were not part of our segment result expense include cost to investigate the data breach provide credit monitoring service to our guest increase staffing in our call center and procure legal and other professional service the million of fourth quarter expense also include an accrual for the estimated probable loss related to the expected payment card network claim by reason of the data breach the ultimate amount of these claim will likely include amount for incremental counterfeit fraud loss and non ordinary course operating expense such card reissuance cost that the payment card network believe they or their issuing bank have incurred in order for to have liability for such claim we believe that court would have to find among other thing that at the time of the data breach the portion of our network that handle payment card data wa noncompliant with applicable data security standard in manner that contributed to the data breach and the network operating rule around reimbursement of operating cost and counterfeit fraud loss are enforceable while an independent third party assessor found the portion of our network that handle payment card data to be compliant with applicable data security standard in the fall of we expect the forensic investigator working on behalf of the payment card network nonetheless to claim that we were not in compliance with those standard at the time of the data breach we base that expectation on our understanding that in case like ours where prior to data breach the entity suffering the breach had been found by an independent third party assessor to be fully compliant with those standard the network approved forensic investigator nonetheless regularly claim that the breached entity wa not in fact compliant with those standard result we believe it is probable that the payment card network will make claim against we expect to dispute the payment card network anticipated claim and we think it is probable that our dispute would lead to settlement negotiation consistent with the experience of other entity that have suffered similar payment card breach we believe such negotiation would effect combined settlement of both the payment card network counterfeit fraud loss allegation and their non ordinary course operating expense allegation we based our year end accrual on the expectation of reaching negotiated settlement of the payment card network anticipated claim and not on any determination that it is probable we would be found liable on these claim were they to be litigated currently we can only reasonably estimate loss associated with settlement of the network expected claim for non ordinary course operating expense the year end accrual doe not include any amount associated with the network expected claim for alleged incremental counterfeit fraud loss because the loss associated with settling such claim while probable in our judgment is not reasonably estimable in part because we have not yet received third party fraud reporting from the payment card network we are not able to reasonably estimate range of possible loss in excess of the year end accrual related to the expected settlement of the payment card network claim because the investigation into the matter is ongoing and there are significant factual and legal issue to be resolved we believe that it is reasonably possible that the ultimate amount paid on payment card network claim could be material to our result of operation in future period litigation and governmental investigationsin addition more than action have been filed in court in many state and other claim have been or may be asserted against on behalf of guest payment card issuing bank shareholder or others seeking damage or other related relief allegedly arising out of the data breach state and federal agency including the state attorney general the federal trade commission and the sec are investigating event related to the data breach including how it occurred it consequence and our response although we are cooperating in these investigation we may be subject to fine or other obligation while loss from these matter is reasonably possible we can not reasonably estimate range of possible loss because our investigation into the matter is ongoing the proceeding remain in the early stage alleged damage have not been specified there is uncertainty to the likelihood of class or class being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified and there are significant factual and legal issue to be resolved further we do not believe that loss from these matter is probable therefore we have not recorded loss contingency liability for litigation claim and governmental investigation in we will continue to evaluate information it becomes known and will record an estimate for loss at the time or time when it is both probable that loss ha been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable future costswe expect to incur significant investigation legal and professional service expense associated with the data breach in future period we will recognize these expense service are received we also expect to incur additional expense associated with incremental fraud and reissuance cost on target redcards coverageto limit our exposure to data breach loss we maintain million of network security insurance coverage above million deductible this coverage and certain other insurance coverage may reduce our exposure we will pursue recovery to the maximum extent available under the policy of february we have recorded million receivable for cost we believe are reimbursable and probable of recovery under our insurance coverage which partially offset the million of expense relating to the data breach other contingencieswe are exposed to other claim and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various method to resolve these matter in manner that we believe serf the best interest of our shareholder
