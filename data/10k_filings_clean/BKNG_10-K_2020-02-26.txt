competition we compete globally with both online and traditional travel and restaurant reservation and related service the market for the service we offer are intensely competitive constantly evolving and subject to rapid change and current and new competitor can launch new service at relatively low cost of our current and potential competitor such google apple alibaba tencent amazon and facebook have significantly more customer or user consumer data and financial and other resource than we do and they may be able to leverage other aspect of their business search or mobile device business to enable them to compete more effectively with for example google ha entered various aspect of the online travel market and ha grown rapidly in this area including by offering flight meta search product google flight hotel meta search product google hotel ad vacation rental meta search product it book on google reservation functionality google travel planning tool that aggregate it flight hotel and

addition amazon ha previously experimented with online travel and ha recently partnered with booking com to provide travel deal to prime user in certain country and with an otc in india to offer domestic flight through amazon pay currently or may in the future compete with variety of company including online travel reservation service large online company including search social networking

provider such accommodation provider rental car or car or ride sharing company and airline many of which have their branded online platform to which they drive business online travel search and price comparison service generally referred to meta search service online restaurant reservation service and company offering technology service and software solution to travel service provider for more information regarding current and potential competitor and the competitive nature of the market in which we operate please see part item risk factor intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance in this annual report on form operation and technology our business is supported by multiple system and platform which designed with an emphasis on scalability performance reliability redundancy and security these system and platform are generally independent among our brand though some have become increasingly connected or shared our software system

protect our proprietary right in our service we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreement with employee and contractor and nondisclosure agreement with party with we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information we also have procured various intellectual property license from third party see part item risk factor we face risk related to our intellectual property seasonalitythe majority of our gross booking are generated in the first half of the year consumer plan and reserve their spring and summer vacation in europe and north america however we generally recognize revenue from these booking the travel begin at check in which can be in quarter other than when the associated reservation are booked in contrast we expense the substantial majority of our marketing activity the expense is incurred which in the case of performance marketing in particular is typically in the quarter in which associated reservation are booked result of this potential timing difference when we record marketing expense and when we recognize associated revenue we experience our highest level of profitability in the third quarter of the year which is when we experience the highest level of accommodation check in for the year for our european and north american business the first quarter of the year is typically our lowest level of profitability and may experience additional volatility in earnings growth rate due to these seasonal timing factor for our asia pacific business we experience the highest level of accommodation check in in the fourth quarter the relative growth rate for our business fluctuate the quarterly distribution of our operating result may vary for additional information regarding factor affecting the seasonality of our business see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation seasonality employee at december we employed approximately employee of which approximately were based in the united state and approximately were based outside the united state we also retain independent contractor to support our customer service website content translation and system support function we have never had work stoppage and we consider our relation with our employee to be good although we have work council or employee representative in certain country our employee are not represented by labor union and are not covered by collective bargaining agreement our future success will depend in part on our ability to continue to attract integrate retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial employee for whom competition is intense see part item risk factor we rely on the performance of highly skilled employee and if we are unable to retain or motivate key employee or hire retain and motivate qualified employee our business would be harmed company website we maintain website with the address www bookingholdings com www booking com www priceline com www kayak com www agoda com www rentalcars com and www opentable com among others we are not including the information contained on our website part of or incorporating

material with or furnish such material to the sec these report and other information are also available free of charge at www sec gov in addition the company code of conduct is available through the www bookingholdings com website and any amendment to or waiver of the code of conduct will be disclosed on that website risk factor the following risk factor and other information included in this annual report on form should be carefully considered the risk and uncertainty described below are not the only one we face additional risk and uncertainty not presently known to or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business result of operation or financial condition if any of the following risk occur our business financial condition operating result and cash flow could be materially adversely affected decline or disruption in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance our financial result and prospect are almost entirely dependent upon the sale of travel service travel including accommodation including hotel motel resort home apartment and other unique place to stay rental car and airline ticket reservation is significantly dependent on discretionary spending level result sale of travel service tend to decline during general economic downturn and recession and time of political or economic uncertainty consumer engage in le discretionary spending are concerned about unemployment or inflation have reduced access to credit or experience other concern or effect that reduce their ability or willingness to travel perceived or actual adverse economic condition including slow slowing or negative economic growth high or rising unemployment rate inflation and weakening currency and concern over government response such higher tax or tariff increased interest rate and reduced government spending could impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand political uncertainty condition or event such the united kingdom transition of the european union brexit including uncertainty in the implementation of brexit and other political concern can also negatively affect consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand at time we experience volatility in transaction growth rate increased cancellation rate and weaker trend in accommodation average daily rate adrs across many region of the world particularly in those country that appear to be most affected by economic and political uncertainty which we believe are due at least in part to these macro economic condition and concern economic or political disruption could cause contribute to or be indicative of deteriorating macro economic condition which in turn could negatively affect travel to or from such country or the travel industry in general and therefore have an adverse impact on our result of operation while lower occupancy rate have historically resulted in accommodation provider increasing their distribution of accommodation reservation through third party intermediary such our remuneration for accommodation reservation transaction change proportionately with price and therefore lower adrs generally have negative effect on our accommodation reservation business and on our revenue and result of operation these and other macro economic uncertainty such oil price geopolitical tension and differing central bank monetary policy have led to significant volatility in the exchange rate between the dollar and the euro the british pound sterling and other currency significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate stock market and oil price can also impact consumer travel behavior for example although lower oil price may lead to increased travel activity consumer have more discretionary fund and airline fare decrease decline in oil price may be indicative of broader macro economic weakness which in turn could negatively affect the travel industry our business and result of operation conversely higher oil price may result in higher airfare and decreased travel activity which can negatively affect our business and result of operation since the united kingdom brexit vote in global market and foreign currency exchange rate have experienced increased volatility including decline in the value of the british pound sterling compared to the dollar although the united kingdom ha formally left the european union many uncertainty remain in the transition period during which the united kingdom will negotiate it future relationship with the european union and other nation after finalization of the transition period of the united kingdom exit from the european union among other thing the united kingdom could lose access to the single european union market and travel between the united kingdom and european union country could be restricted we could face new regulatory cost and challenge if regulation and policy diverge from those of the european union or if additional business license are required since the term of the united kingdom exit from the european union and or the european economic area are uncertain we are unable to predict the effect brexit will have on our business and result of operation the uncertainty of macro economic factor and their impact on consumer behavior which may differ across region make it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trend and the timing and degree of their impact on our market and business which in turn could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business and adversely affect our result of operation addition event beyond our control such oil price stock market volatility terrorist attack unusual or extreme weather or natural disaster such earthquake hurricane tsunami flood fire drought and volcanic eruption travel related health concern including pandemic and epidemic such coronaviruses ebola and zika political instability change in economic condition war and regional hostility imposition of tax tariff or surcharge by regulatory authority change in trade policy or trade dispute change in immigration policy travel related accident or increased focus on the environmental impact of travel have previously and may in the future disrupt travel limit the ability or willingness of traveler to visit certain location or otherwise result in decline in travel demand and adversely affect our business and result of operation because these event or concern and the full impact of their effect are largely unpredictable they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumer and therefore demand for our service and our relationship with travel service provider and other partner any of which can adversely affect our business and result of operation certain jurisdiction particularly in europe are considering regulation intended to address the issue of overtourism including by restricting access to city center or popular tourist destination or limiting accommodation offering in surrounding area such by restricting construction of new hotel or the renting of home or apartment such regulation could adversely affect travel to or our ability to offer accommodation in such market which could negatively impact our business growth and result of operation the united state ha implemented or proposed or is considering various travel restriction and action that could affect trade policy or practice which could also adversely affect travel to or from the united state result of the recent coronavirus outbreak originating in china we began in january to experience and continue to experience significant decline in travel demand and increase in customer cancellation predominantly related to travel to from or in china and certain other asian market though concern about the coronavirus are also negatively impacting travel demand and therefore our business generally some country have implemented travel ban or restriction and some airline have suspended or limited flight to or from china we are working with our traveler and travel service provider partner to address cancellation request for refund rebookings and similar matter in addition like many other company we have instructed or allowed employee in high risk area to work from home or not report to work which especially if this persists for prolonged period of time may have an adverse impact on our employee ability to service traveler operation and system the ultimate extent of the coronavirus outbreak and it impact on travel in currently affected country or more broadly is unknown and impossible to predict with certainty result the full extent to which the coronavirus will impact our business and result of operation is unknown however decreased travel demand resulting from the outbreak ha had negative impact and is likely to have negative and material impact on our business growth and result of operation in addition we may incur additional customer service cost in connection with servicing traveler affected by the outbreak which would also have negative impact on our result of operation intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance we compete globally with both online and traditional travel and restaurant reservation and related service the market for the service we offer are intensely competitive constantly evolving and subject to rapid change and current and new competitor can launch new service at relatively low cost some of our current and potential competitor such google apple alibaba tencent amazon and facebook have significantly more customer or user consumer data and financial and other resource than we do and they may be able to leverage other aspect of their business search or

of the world largest company and other large established company with substantial resource and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating internet traffic offer travel or travel related search meta search and or reservation booking service and may create additional inroad into online travel google travel meta search service google hotel ad and google flight have grown rapidly and have achieved significant market share in relatively short time meta search service leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search result for the consumer specific itinerary across travel service provider accommodation rental car company or airline online travel company otc and other online platform and in many instance compete directly with for customer meta search service intend to appeal to consumer by showing broader travel search result than may be available through otcs or other online platform which could lead to travel service provider or others gaining larger share of search traffic google leverage it general search business to promote it meta search offering by showing meta search result at the top of it organic search result further tripadvisor and trivago two other leading meta search company support their meta search service with significant brand and performance marketing through our kayak meta search service we compete directly with these and other meta search service if we are unable to effectively compete with these company our business and result of operation could be harmed consumer may favor travel service offered by meta search platform or search company over otcs which could reduce traffic to our travel reservation platform increase consumer awareness of our competitor brand and service and our marketing and other customer acquisition cost to the extent any such consumer behavior lead to growth in our kayak meta search business such growth may not result in sufficient increase in revenue from our kayak meta search business to offset any related decrease in revenue or increase in marketing and other customer acquisition cost experienced by our otc brand further meta search service may evolve into more traditional otcs by offering consumer the ability to make travel reservation directly through their platform for example tripadvisor allows consumer to make reservation at some accommodation while staying on tripadvisor through it instant booking offering which includes participation by many of the leading global hotel chain google also provides reservation service through book on google to the extent we participate in any such offering provided by meta search service resulting reservation could be le profitable and could cannibalize business that would otherwise come directly to or through other more profitable channel if consumer book travel service through service such tripadvisor instant booking google book on google meta search website or directly with travel service provider after visiting meta search platform or using meta search utility on traditional search engine without using an otc like or if meta search service limit our participation within their search result or evolve into more traditional otcs we may need to increase our marketing or other customer acquisition cost to maintain or grow our reservation booking and our business and result of operation could be adversely affected over the year there ha been proliferation of new channel through which accommodation provider can offer reservation the market for travel service ha evolved for example company such airbnb and expedia group offer service providing alternative accommodation property owner particularly individual an online place to list their accommodation where traveler can search and book such property and compete directly with our alternative accommodation service in addition airbnb which owns hoteltonight offer some hotel reservation through it online platform further meta search service may lower the cost for new company to enter the market by providing distribution channel without the cost of promoting the new entrant brand to drive consumer directly to it platform new travel related service are frequently being introduced to the market for example in google launched google travel which combine it hotel flight and package offering into one website with trip planning tool some of our competitor and potential competitor offer variety of online service such food delivery shopping gaming or search service many of which are used by consumer more frequently than online travel service result competitor or potential competitor that ha established other more frequent online interaction with consumer may be able to more easily or cost effectively acquire customer for it online travel service than we can for example some competitor or potential competitor with more frequent online interaction with consumer are seeking to create super apps where consumer can use many online service without leaving that company app in particular in market such asia where online activity including commerce is conducted primarily through apps on mobile device if any of these platform are successful in offering new travel related service or service similar to to consumer would otherwise use our platform or if we are unable to offer our service to consumer within these super apps our customer acquisition effort could be le effective and our customer acquisition cost including our brand and performance marketing expense could increase either of which would harm our business and result of operation although we believe that providing an extensive collection of property excellent customer service and an intuitive easy to use consumer experience are important factor influencing consumer decision to make reservation for many consumer particularly in certain market the price of the travel service is the primary factor determining whether consumer will book reservation result it is increasingly important to offer travel service such accommodation reservation at competitive price whether through discount coupon closed user group rate or loyalty program or otherwise discounting and couponing coupled with high degree of consumer shopping behavior is particularly common in asian market in some case our competitor are willing to make little or no profit on transaction or offer travel service at loss in order to gain market share result in certain market we may need to provide discount or other incentive in order to be competitive which may make it difficult for to maintain or grow market share and to maintain historical profit margin these initiative may also result in lower adrs and lower revenue percentage of gross booking part of our strategy to provide more payment option to consumer and travel service provider booking com is increasingly processing transaction on merchant basis where it facilitates payment on behalf of customer this allows booking com to present consumer with more pricing option if we are unable to effectively offer competitive price our market share business and result of operation could be materially adversely affected travel service provider including hotel chain rental car company and airline with which we conduct business compete with in online channel to drive consumer to their own platform in lieu of third party distributor such travel service provider may charge lower price and in some instance offer advantage such loyalty point or special discount to member of closed user group such loyalty program participant or consumer with registered account any of which could make their offering more attractive to consumer than our service for example many large hotel chain have instituted additional initiative such increased discounting and incentive to encourage consumer to book accommodation directly through their online platform we also offer various incentive to consumer and may need to offer additional or increased advantage to maintain or grow our reservation booking which adversely impact our profit margin further among travel service provider such marriott international acquisition of starwood hotel resort in could result in lower rate of commission paid to otcs increased discounting and greater incentive for consumer to join closed user group such travel service provider expand their offering if we are not effective our competitor including hotel chain in offering discounted price and other incentive to consumer our ability to grow and compete and our result of operation could be harmed we are exposed to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate we conduct substantial majority of our business outside the united state but we report our result in dollar result we face exposure to movement in foreign currency exchange rate the financial result of our international business are translated from local currency principally euro and british pound sterling into dollar when the dollar strengthens other currency in which we transact it generally in our foreign currency denominated net asset gross booking revenue operating expense and net income are lower expressed in dollar when the dollar weakens against other currency in which we transact it generally did in and our foreign currency denominated net asset gross booking revenue operating expense and net income are higher expressed in dollar foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation on transaction denominated in currency other than the functional currency result in gain and loss that are reflected in our financial result recent year have seen significant volatility in the exchange rate between the euro the british pound sterling the dollar and other currency significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate can affect consumer travel behavior for example the strengthening of the dollar relative to the euro in made it more expensive for european to travel to the united state consumer traveling from country whose currency ha weakened against other currency may book lower adr accommodation choose to shorten or cancel their international travel plan or choose to travel domestically rather than internationally any of which could adversely affect our gross booking revenue and result of operation in particular when expressed in dollar volatility in foreign currency exchange rate and it impact on consumer behavior which may differ across region make it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trend and the timing and degree of their impact on our market and business which in turn make it more difficult to manage our business and forecast our financial and operational performance we face risk related to the growth rate and the global expansion of our business we derive substantial portion of our revenue and have significant operation outside the united state our international business include our netherlands based otc brand booking com including rentalcars com based in the united kingdom our asia based otc brand agoda and to lesser extent kayak international meta search service and opentable international restaurant reservation business our international otc operation have historically achieved significant year over year growth in their gross booking in particular with respect to their accommodation reservation service these growth rate which have contributed significantly to our growth in consolidated revenue and earnings have generally declined over time the absolute level of our gross booking increased and online travel growth rate have declined other factor may also slow the growth rate of our international business including for example worldwide or regional economic condition strengthening of the dollar versus the euro the british pound sterling and other currency decline in adrs increase in cancellation adverse change in travel market condition and the competitiveness of the market any decline in the growth rate of our international business would have negative impact on our revenue and earnings growth rate and consequence our stock price our strategy involves continued expansion throughout the world many region have different economic condition custom language currency consumer expectation level of consumer acceptance and use of online platform for commerce legislation regulatory environment including labor law and custom tax law and level of political stability and we are subject to associated risk typical of international business international market may have strong local competitor with an established brand and travel service provider or restaurant relationship that may make expansion in that market difficult or costly and take more time than anticipated in addition compliance with legal regulatory or tax requirement in multiple jurisdiction place demand on our time and resource and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse legal regulatory or tax consequence in some market such china legal and other regulatory requirement may prohibit or limit participation by foreign business such by making foreign ownership or management of internet or travel related business illegal or difficult or may make direct participation in those market uneconomic which could make our entry into and expansion in those market difficult or impossible require that we work with local partner or result in higher operating cost certain market in which we operate that are in earlier stage of development have lower operating margin compared to more mature market which could have negative impact on our overall profit margin these market increase in size over time if we are unsuccessful in expanding in new and existing market and effectively managing that expansion our business and result of operation could be adversely affected we intend to continue to invest in adding accommodation available for reservation on our platform such hotel motel resort home apartment and other unique place to stay the growth rate of our accommodation may vary in part result of removing accommodation from our platform from time to time many of the newer accommodation we add to our travel reservation service especially in highly penetrated market may have fewer room or higher credit risk and may appeal to smaller subset of consumer hostel and bed and breakfast because alternative accommodation are often either single unit or small collection of independent unit these property generally represent more limited booking opportunity than hotel motel and resort which generally have more unit to rent per property further alternative accommodation in general may be subject to increased seasonality due to local tourism season weather or other factor or may not be available at peak time due to use by the property owner we also experience lower profit margin with respect to alternative accommodation property due to certain additional cost related to offering these accommodation on our platform we increase our alternative accommodation business these different characteristic negatively impact our profit margin and to the extent these property represent an increasing percentage of the property added to our platform we expect that our room night growth rate and property growth rate will continue to diverge over time since each such alternative accommodation property ha fewer booking opportunity result of the foregoing the percentage of alternative accommodation property increase the number of reservation per property will likely continue to decrease in addition our alternative accommodation reservation business grows we may incur increasing number of complaint related to non existent property or property that are significantly different than described in the listing well claim of liability based on event occurring at such property such robbery injury death and other similar event such complaint or claim could result in negative publicity and increased cost which could adversely affect our reputation business and result of operation further the regulatory environment related to some alternative accommodation such home and apartment is evolving and law regulation or property association rule could impose restriction or burden on these property owner and manager that limit or negatively affect their ability to rent their property some jurisdiction have adopted or are considering statute or ordinance that prohibit owner and manager from renting certain property for fewer than stated number of consecutive day or for more than an aggregate total number of day per year or that require owner or manager to obtain license to rent their property in addition several jurisdiction have adopted or are considering adopting statute or ordinance requiring online platform that list certain alternative accommodation to obtain license to list such accommodation and or to comply with other restriction or requirement this dynamic regulatory environment requires to expend significant time and resource and could negatively impact the growth and or size of our alternative accommodation reservation business we believe that the increase in the number and variety of accommodation provider that participate on our platform and the corresponding access to accommodation room night ha been key driver of the growth of our accommodation reservation business the breadth of our accommodation booking typically make an attractive source of consumer demand for our accommodation provider however accommodation provider may wish to limit the amount of business that flow through single distribution channel also certain jurisdiction particularly in europe are considering regulation intended to address the issue of overtourism including by restricting accommodation offering in city center or near popular tourist destination such by restricting construction of new hotel or the renting of home or apartment such restriction could also include limiting the number of tourist permitted to visit and stay near popular area during peak season or general matter result we may experience constraint on the number of listing or accommodation room night actually available to which could negatively impact our business growth rate and result of operation the number of our employee worldwide ha grown from approximately at december to approximately at december which growth is mostly comprised of hire by our international operation the growth of our operation may make it more difficult to hire train retain motivate and manage the required employee historically our brand operated on largely independent basis and many of them focused on particular service or geography we look to develop the connected trip we are increasing the collaboration cooperation and interdependency among our brand we manage this shift in addition to managing organic growth and growth through acquisition we may find it difficult to maintain the beneficial aspect of our corporate culture at the brand company and throughout the organization whole in addition expansion increase the complexity of our business and place additional strain on our management operation technical performance financial resource and administrative legal tax internal control and financial reporting function our current and planned employee system procedure and control may not be adequate to support and effectively manage this growth and increased complexity especially we employ employee in multiple geographic location around the world and increase the number and variety of our product and payment system the implementation of new information technology payment enterprise resource planning erp or other system could be disruptive and or costly or we may experience difficulty successfully integrating new system into existing system or migrating to new system from existing system any of which could adversely affect our business and result of operation rely on performance and brand marketing channel to generate significant amount of traffic to our platform and grow our business we believe that maintaining and strengthening our brand are important aspect of our effort to attract and retain customer we have invested considerable money and resource in the establishment and maintenance of our brand and we will continue to invest resource in brand marketing and other brand building effort to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brand in addition effective performance marketing ha been an important factor in our growth and we believe it will continue to be important to our future success our competitor spend increasingly more on advertising and other marketing effort we are required to spend more in order to maintain our brand recognition and in the case of performance marketing to maintain and grow traffic to our platform through performance marketing channel we may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness and acceptance of our brand and even if we are successful in our branding effort such effort may not be cost effective for instance we have observed increased brand marketing by otcs meta search service and travel service provider which may make our brand marketing effort more expensive and le effective if we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness and acceptance of our brand in cost effective manner our business market share and result of operation would be materially adversely affected our online performance marketing efficiency expressed performance marketing expense percentage of revenue is impacted by number of factor that are subject to variability and that are in some case outside of our control including adrs cost per click cancellation rate foreign currency exchange rate our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customer and the extent to which consumer come directly to our website or mobile apps for booking for example competition for desired ranking in search result and or decline in ad click by consumer could increase our cost per click and reduce our performance marketing efficiency we use third party website including online search engine primarily google meta search and travel research service and affiliate marketing the primary mean of generating traffic to our website growth of some of these channel ha slowed our performance marketing expense ha increased significantly and our performance marketing efficiency ha declined in recent year trend we expect to continue though the rate of decrease may fluctuate and there may be period of stable or increasing return on investment roi from time to time further at time we may pursue strategy of increasing performance marketing roi which could negatively affect our gross booking and revenue growth rate when evaluating our performance marketing spend we consider several factor for each channel such the customer experience on the advertising platform the incrementality of the traffic we receive and the anticipated repeat rate from particular platform well other factor pursuing strategy of improving performance marketing roi we did beginning in the third quarter of through the fourth quarter of along with factor such competitor action in the bidding environment the amount of marketing invested by these channel to generate demand and overall performance marketing platform traffic growth trend which have shown volatility and long term deceleration of growth rate may also impact growth rate for performance marketing channel any reduction in our performance marketing efficiency could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation whether through reduced revenue or revenue growth or through performance marketing expense increasing faster than revenue and thereby reducing margin and earnings growth we believe that number of factor could cause consumer to increase their shopping activity making travel purchase increased shopping activity reduces our performance marketing efficiency and effectiveness because traffic becomes le likely to result in reservation through our platform and such traffic is more likely to be obtained through paid performance marketing channel than through direct channel further consumer may favor travel service offered by search or meta search company over otcs which could reduce traffic to our travel reservation platform increase consumer awareness of our competitor brand and platform increase our marketing and other customer acquisition cost and adversely affect our business margin and result of operation to the extent any such increased shopping behavior lead to growth in our kayak meta search business such growth may not result in sufficient increase in revenue from our kayak meta search business to offset any related decrease in revenue or increase in marketing and other customer acquisition cost experienced by our otc brand we may not be able to keep up with rapid technological or other market change the market in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standard consolidation frequent new service announcement introduction and enhancement and changing consumer demand and preference we may not be able to keep up with these rapid change in addition these market characteristic are heightened by the progress of technology adoption in various market including the continuing adoption of the internet and online commerce in certain geography and the emergence and growth of the use of smartphones tablet and other smart device including those with voice and artificial intelligence capability for mobile commerce transaction new development in other area such cloud computing could make entering our market easier for competitor due to lower upfront technology cost result our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technology to adapt our service online platform to evolving industry standard and local preference and to continually innovate and improve the performance feature and reliability of our service and online platform in response to competitive service offering and the evolving demand of the marketplace in particular it is increasingly important for to effectively offer our service on mobile device through mobile apps and mobile optimized website and to tailor our service to varying device and platform any failure by to successfully develop and achieve consumer adoption of our mobile platform would have material and adverse effect on our growth market share business and result of operation further to the extent mobile device or platform enable user to block advertising content our advertising revenue and our ability to market our brand and acquire new consumer may be negatively affected we believe that ease of use comprehensive functionality and the look and feel of our mobile platform are increasingly competitively critical consumer obtain more of their travel and restaurant service through mobile device and platform result we intend to continue to spend significant resource maintaining developing and enhancing our mobile platform and other technology and platform additionally our ability to achieve our long term strategy to build the connected trip depends on successfully integrating and developing new and evolving technology which is likely to require increased financial and personnel investment that could have an adverse impact on our result of operation we achieve the expected return on these investment however these effort may not be successful in improving the travel experience or retaining and attracting new customer which would harm our business and result of operation further technical innovation often result in bug vulnerability and other system failure any such bug vulnerability or failure especially in connection with significant technical implementation or change could result in lost business harm to our brand or reputation consumer complaint and other adverse consequence any of which could adversely affect our business and result of operation we believe that another critical component to our future success will be our ability to enhance our payment capability including by offering alternative payment solution to consumer even when those payment solution may not be accepted by the travel service provider or restaurant alternate payment provider such alipay paytm and wechat pay operate closed loop payment system with direct connection to both consumer and merchant in many market particularly in asia where credit card are not readily available and or commerce is largely carried out through mobile device these and other emerging alternative payment method are the exclusive or preferred mean of payment for many consumer therefore if we are unable to offer consumer their preferred method of payment by integrating new or emerging payment method into our platform we may not be able to effectively offer our service to these consumer which would limit our growth opportunity in these market and our business and result of operation could be harmed furthermore the overall size of our business continues to grow the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass wider range of service and technology including service and technology that may be outside of our historical core business and our ability to keep pace may slow our current and potential competitor range from large and established company to emerging start ups emerging start ups may be able to innovate and focus on developing particularly new product or service faster than we can or may foresee consumer need for new service or technology before we do some of our larger competitor or potential competitor have more resource or more established or varied relationship with consumer than we have and they could use these advantage in way that could affect our competitive position including by making acquisition entering or investing in travel reservation business investing in research and development and competing aggressively for highly skilled employee for example because consumer often utilize other online service more frequently than online travel service competitor or potential competitor that ha established other more frequent online interaction with consumer may be able to more easily or cost effectively acquire consumer for it online travel service than we can in addition the widespread adoption of new internet networking or telecommunication technology or other technological change including new device and service such amazon echo and alexa and google home and google assistant developing technology such artificial intelligence chatbot and virtual reality technology and the creation of super apps where consumer can use many online service without leaving particular app could require to incur substantial expenditure to modify or adapt our service or infrastructure to these new technology which could adversely affect our result of operation or financial condition any failure to implement or adapt to new technology in timely manner or at all could adversely affect our ability to compete increase our consumer acquisition cost or otherwise adversely affect our business and therefore adversely affect our brand market share and result of operation our processing storage use and disclosure of personal data expose to risk of internal or external security breach and could give rise to liability and or damage to reputation the security of data when engaging in commerce is essential to maintaining consumer and travel service provider confidence in our service cyberattacks by individual group of hacker and state sponsored organization are increasing in frequency and sophistication and are constantly evolving any security breach whether instigated internally or externally on our system or third party system could significantly harm our reputation and therefore our business brand market share and result of operation consumer who use certain of our service provide with their credit card information we require user and password in order to access our information technology system we also use encryption and authentication technology to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent unauthorized access to our data or account computer circumvention capability new discovery or advance or other development including our own act or omission could result in compromise or breach of consumer data for example third party may attempt to fraudulently induce employee travel service provider partner or consumer to disclose user name password or other sensitive information phishing which may in turn be used to access our information technology system or to defraud our partner or consumer third party may also attempt to take over consumer account by using password usernames and other personal information obtained elsewhere to attempt to login to consumer account on our platform we have experienced targeted and organized phishing and account takeover attack and we expect to continue to experience these event in the future these risk are likely to increase we expand our offering integrate our product and service and store and process more data including personal information our effort to protect information from unauthorized access may be unsuccessful or may result in the rejection of legitimate attempt to book reservation through our service any of which could result in lost business and could materially and adversely affect our business reputation and result of operation our existing security measure may not be successful in preventing security breach party whether internal external an affiliate or unrelated third party that is able to circumvent our security system could steal consumer information or transaction data or other proprietary information in the last few year several major company experienced high profile security breach that exposed their system and information and or their consumer or employee personal information and it is expected that these type of event will continue to occur we have heightened risk of security breach due to some of our operation being located in certain international jurisdiction we expend significant resource to protect against security breach and regularly increase our security related expenditure to maintain or increase our system security we have experienced and responded to cyberattacks which we believe have not had significant impact on the integrity of our system or the security of data including customer data maintained by these issue are likely to become more difficult to manage we expand the number of place where we operate and the number and variety of service we offer and the tool and technique used in such attack become more advanced security breach could result in severe damage to our information technology infrastructure including damage that could impair our ability to offer our service or the ability of consumer to make reservation or conduct search through our service well loss of consumer financial or other data that could materially and adversely affect our ability to conduct our business satisfy our commercial obligation or meet our public reporting requirement in timely fashion or at all security breach could also result in negative publicity damage our reputation expose to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability subject to regulatory penalty and sanction or cause consumer to lose confidence in our security and choose to use the service of our competitor any of which would have negative effect on our brand market share result of operation and financial condition our insurance policy have coverage limit and may not be adequate to reimburse for all loss caused by security breach we also face risk associated with security breach affecting third party conducting business over the internet consumer generally are concerned with security and privacy on the internet and any publicized security problem could negatively affect consumer willingness to provide private information or effect online commercial transaction generally including through our service some of our business is conducted with third party marketing affiliate which may generate travel reservation through our infrastructure or through other system additionally our consumer personal data could be affected by security breach at third party upon which we rely such travel service provider payroll provider health plan provider payment processor or gd security breach at any such third party marketing affiliate travel service provider payment processor gd or other third party on which we rely such the security breach experienced by sabre in may could be perceived by consumer security breach of our system and in any event could result in negative publicity subject to notification requirement damage our reputation expose to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject to regulatory penalty and sanction in addition such third party may not comply with applicable disclosure requirement or with parameter within which we permit them to process data which could expose to liability in the operation of our business we receive and store large volume of personally identifiable data and payment information this data is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation in numerous jurisdiction around the world the european union general data protection regulation the gdpr which went into effect in may is designed to unify data protection within the european union under single law which ha resulted and will continue to result in significantly greater compliance burden and cost for under the gdpr fine of up to million euro or up to of the annual global revenue of the infringer whichever is greater could be imposed several data protection authority have already imposed significant fine on company of various size across industry sector for violation of the gdpr the california consumer privacy act the ccpa which went into effect in january ha created new data privacy right for user in california and ha resulted and will continue to result in additional complexity and cost related to compliance many other jurisdiction continue to consider adopting or may adopt similar data protection regulation these regulation are typically intended to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction well to give individual greater right and or control over how their data is processed these law and their interpretation continue develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction additionally some of these regulation such the ccpa give consumer private right of action against company for violation of these rule in many case these law apply not only to third party transaction but also to transfer of information between and our subsidiary including employee information while we have invested and continue to invest significant resource to comply with the gdpr ccpa and other privacy regulation many of these regulation are new extremely complex and subject to interpretation non compliance with these law could result in negative publicity damage to our reputation significant penalty or other legal liability if legislation or regulation are expanded to require change in our business practice or if governing jurisdiction interpret or implement their legislation or regulation in way that negatively affect our business our result of operation financial condition or competitive position could be adversely affected our business could be negatively affected by change in online search and meta search algorithm and dynamic or traffic generating arrangement we use google to generate significant portion of the traffic to our platform and to lesser extent we use other search and meta search service to generate traffic to our platform principally through pay per click marketing campaign the pricing and operating dynamic on these search and meta search platform can experience rapid change commercially technically and competitively for example google frequently update and change the logic which determines the placement and display of result of consumer search such that the placement of link to our platform can be negatively affected and our cost to improve or maintain our placement in search result can increase the european commission ha fined google significant amount for anti competitive behavior relating to it comparison shopping service and online search advertising service change by google in how it present travel search result including it promotion of it travel meta search service or the manner in which it conduct the auction for placement among search result whether result of court order investigation or other reason may be competitively disadvantageous to and may impact our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our platform which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business market share and result of operation recently google announced modification to it flight display model including that it would not be charging airline and otcs for sending referral from google flight result airline and otc partner may choose to limit or eliminate their use of other meta search service or may demand cost saving from their other meta search service and or google may receive access to discounted fare not provided to meta search service that charge for referral any of which could adversely affect our meta search business profit margin and result of operation similarly change by our other search and meta search partner in how they present travel search result or the manner in which they conduct the auction for placement among search result may be competitively disadvantageous to and may impact our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our platform in addition if travel search traffic decline or grows le quickly than in the past our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our platform through performance marketing on general search platform may be adversely affected which could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation in addition we purchase online traffic from number of other source including some operated by our competitor in the form of pay per click arrangement that can be terminated with little or no notice if one or more of such arrangement is terminated our business market share and result of operation could be adversely affected we rely on various third party distribution channel marketing affiliate to distribute accommodation rental car and airline ticket reservation should one or more of such third party cease distribution of reservation made through or suffer deterioration in it search or meta search ranking due to change in search or meta search algorithm or otherwise our business market share and result of operation could be negatively affected system capacity constraint system failure or denial of service or other attack could harm our business and our reputation we have experienced rapid growth in consumer traffic to our online platform the number of accommodation on our extranets and the geographic breadth of our operation if our system can not be expanded to cope with increased demand or fail to perform we could experience unanticipated disruption in service slower response time decreased customer service and customer satisfaction and delay in the introduction of new service any of which could impair our reputation damage our brand and materially and adversely affect our result of operation further an online business we are dependent on the internet and maintaining connectivity between and consumer source of internet traffic such google and our travel service provider and restaurant consumer increasingly turn to mobile and other smart device we also become dependent on consumer access to the internet through mobile carrier and their system disruption in internet access such the denial of service attack against dyn in october that resulted in service outage for several major internet company whether generally in specific market or otherwise especially if widespread or prolonged could materially adversely affect our business and result of operation while we do maintain redundant system and hosting service it is possible that we could experience an interruption in our business and we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate for all loss that may occur computer hardware for operating our service is currently located at hosting facility around the world these system and operation are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error computer virus flood fire power loss telecommunication failure and similar event they are also subject to break in sabotage intentional act of vandalism terrorism and similar misconduct despite any precaution we may take the occurrence of any disruption of service due to any such misconduct natural disaster or other unanticipated problem at such facility or the failure by such facility to provide our required data communication capacity could result in lengthy interruption or delay in our service any system failure that cause an interruption or delay in service could impair our reputation damage our brand result in lost business or result in consumer choosing to use competitive service any of which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation our existing security measure may not be successful in preventing attack on our system and any such attack could cause significant interruption in our operation for instance from time to time we have experienced denial of service type attack on our system that have made portion of our website slow or unavailable for period of time there are numerous other potential form of attack such phishing where third party attempt to infiltrate our system or acquire information by posing legitimate inquiry or electronic communication account takeover attack sql injection where third party attempt to insert malicious code into our software through data entry field in our website in order to gain control of the system and attempting to use our website platform to launch denial of service attack on another party each of which could cause significant interruption in our operation and potentially adversely affect the value of our brand operation and result of operation or involve in legal or regulatory proceeding we expend significant resource in an attempt to prepare for and mitigate the effect of any such attack reduction in the availability and response time of our online service could cause loss of substantial business volume during the occurrence of any such attack on our system and measure we may take to divert suspect traffic in the event of such an attack could result in the diversion of bona fide customer these issue are likely to become more difficult to manage we expand the number of place where we operate and the variety of service we offer and the tool and technique used in such attack become more advanced successful attack could result in negative publicity damage our reputation and prevent consumer from booking travel service researching travel service or making restaurant reservation through during the attack any of which could cause consumer to use the service of our competitor which would have negative effect on the value of our brand our market share business and result of operation we rely on certain third party computer system and third party service provider including gd and computerized central reservation system of the accommodation rental car and airline industry in connection with providing some of our service any damage to breach of or interruption in these third party service and system or deterioration in their performance could prevent from booking related accommodation rental car and airline reservation and have material adverse effect on our business brand and result of operation our agreement with some third party service provider are terminable upon short notice and often do not provide recourse for service interruption in the event our arrangement with any such third party is terminated we may not be able to find an alternative source of system support on timely basis or on commercially reasonable term and result it could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation we depend upon various third party to process payment including credit card for our merchant transaction around the world in addition we rely on third party to provide credit card number which we use payment mechanism for merchant transaction if any such third party were wholly or partially compromised our cash flow could be disrupted or we may not be able to generate merchant transaction and related revenue until such time replacement process could be put in place with different vendor and this could have negative effect on our business reputation and result of operation we do not have completely formalized or comprehensive disaster recovery plan in every geographic region in which we conduct business in the event of certain system failure we may not be able to switch to back up system immediately and the time to full recovery could be prolonged like many online business we have experienced system failure from time to time in addition to placing increased burden on our engineering staff these outage create significant amount of consumer question and complaint that need to be addressed by our customer support employee any unscheduled interruption in our service could result in an immediate loss of revenue that could be substantial increase customer service cost harm our reputation and result in some consumer switching to our competitor if we experience frequent or persistent system failure our reputation and brand could be permanently and significantly harmed we have taken and continue to take step to increase the reliability and redundancy of our system these step are expensive may reduce our margin and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime we use both internally developed system and third party system to operate our service including transaction processing order management and financial and accounting system if the number of consumer using our service increase substantially or if critical third party system stop operating designed we may need to significantly expand and upgrade our technology transaction processing system financial and accounting system or other infrastructure we may not be able to our system and infrastructure to accommodate such condition in timely manner and depending on the system affected our transactional financial and accounting system could be impacted for meaningful amount of time before upgrade expansion or repair many of our process and system including those related to processing and recording revenue are highly automated and involve multiple input from various it system which can mitigate the risk of human error but which can also make testing troubleshooting and auditing more difficult result it may be difficult to quickly detect and correct error embedded in these process or system consumer adoption and use of mobile device creates challenge and may enable device company such google and apple to compete directly with widespread adoption of mobile device such the iphone android enabled smartphones and tablet such the ipad coupled with the web browsing functionality and development of thousand of apps available on these device is driving substantial online traffic and commerce to mobile platform we have experienced significant shift of business both direct and indirect to mobile platform and our advertising partner are also seeing rapid shift of traffic to mobile platform some competitor offer last minute discount for mobile accommodation reservation advertising and distribution opportunity may be more limited on mobile device given their smaller screen size the revenue earned on mobile transaction may be le than typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing pattern for example accommodation reservation made on mobile device typically are for shorter length of stay have lower adrs and are not made far in advance further given the device size and technical limitation of tablet and smartphones mobile consumer may not be willing to download multiple apps from multiple company providing similar service and instead prefer to use one or limited number of apps for their mobile travel and restaurant research and reservation activity result the consumer experience with mobile apps well brand recognition and loyalty are likely to become increasingly important our mobile offering have received generally strong review and are driving material and increasing share of our business we believe that mobile booking present an opportunity for growth and are necessary to maintain and grow our business consumer increasingly turn to mobile device instead of personal computer result it is increasingly important for to develop and maintain effective mobile platform to provide consumer with an appealing easy to use mobile experience if we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new user friendly and differentiated mobile offering and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platform or if our mobile offering are not used by consumer we could lose market share and our business future growth and result of operation could be adversely affected google android operating system is the leading smartphone operating system in the world result google ha the ability to leverage it android operating system to give it travel service competitive advantage either technically or with prominence on it google play app store or within it mobile search result further google is the leading internet search service and ha leveraged it search popularity to promote it travel service the european commission ha fined google significant amount for breaching european union antitrust rule by imposing restriction on android device manufacturer and mobile network operator including by mandating the pre installation of google apps and limiting access to it google play app store in addition the european commission decision requires google to end those practice or face penalty payment of up to of the average daily worldwide turnover of alphabet google parent company google ha appealed the european commission decision and it is not yet clear how or whether the decision will affect google business including it travel service apple the producer of among other thing the iphone and ipad obtained patent for itravel mobile app that would allow traveler to check in for travel reservation in

which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and cash flow for example booking com is the subject of tax proceeding in france and ha been assessed approximately million euro the majority of which represents penalty and interest we believe that booking com ha been and continues to be in compliance with french tax law and we are contesting the assessment in january we were required to pay the assessment for the year through million euro in order to preserve our right to contest the assessment for that period in court though the payment is not an admission that we owe the tax see note to our consolidated financial statement for more information regarding certain tax contingency in general government are increasingly focused on way to increase tax revenue which ha contributed to an increase in audit activity more aggressive position taken by tax authority more time and difficulty to resolve any audit or dispute and an increase in new tax legislation any such additional tax or other assessment may be in excess of our current tax provision or may require to modify our business practice in order to reduce our exposure to additional tax going forward any of which could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition in december the tax cut and job act the tax act wa enacted into

we are unable to operate our business so that beat doe not impact our effective tax rate result of operation and cash flow would be materially adversely affected the tax law change made by the tax act are broad and complex and there continues to be significant uncertainty about how the tax act will be interpreted at both the federal and state level the interpretation and implementation of the tax act and regulation rule or guidance that have been or may be adopted under or result from the tax act have had and could have negative impact on our result of operation and cash flow additionally there have been significant change made and proposed to international tax law that increase the complexity burden and cost of tax compliance the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd initiated the base erosion and profit shifting beps project to ensure international tax standard keep pace with change in global business practice and to address situation where multinational business may pay little or no tax in certain jurisdiction by shifting profit away from jurisdiction in which the profit generating activity take place the oecd is working towards consensus based solution by the end of to address the challenge posed to the current tax system by the digitalization of the economy the oecd secretariat current proposal aim to ensure that multinational business are taxed in jurisdiction where they are conducting significant business but do not have physical presence by establishing new nexus rule determining where tax should be paid and new profit allocation rule determining what portion of profit should be taxed certain country and number of member state have taken step to unilaterally introduce digital service tax to address the issue of multinational business carrying on business in their jurisdiction without physical presence and therefore generally not subject to income tax in those jurisdiction in july france passed legislation that introduced digital service tax which is retroactively applicable of january although the french tax authority have postponed the requirement to pay the digital service tax until december the french government ha not repealed the tax and is merely postponing the payment of the tax to see if consensus is reached by the oecd during on how online business should be taxed consequently we continue to accrue for the tax in because we will owe the tax to france if no consensus is reached by the oecd and france doe not repeal the tax italy and turkey have also passed legislation that introduces digital service tax of and respectively that will be effective in several other country are also considering adopting digital service tax for example the united kingdom ha proposed legislation to implement digital

parliament for approval in january that would tax digital service at many question remain to the enactment form and application of these digital service tax for example it is not clear whether all country will allow deduction of digital service tax for income tax purpose or whether there is potential for double taxation on the same transaction the interpretation and implementation of the various digital service tax especially if there is inconsistency in the application of these tax across tax jurisdiction could have materially adverse impact on our result of operation and cash flow further digital service tax may not apply to our competitor such hotel chain and smaller otcs which harm our business and competitive position change to international tax law including new definition of permanent establishment new nexus and profit allocation rule or change affecting the benefit of preferential tax regime such the dutch innovation box tax discussed below could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings and adversely impact our effective tax rate further change to tax law and additional reporting requirement could increase the complexity burden and cost of compliance due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activity any change in or international taxation of our activity or the combined effect of tax law in multiple jurisdiction may increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the complexity and cost associated with tax compliance especially if change are implemented or interpreted inconsistently across tax jurisdiction and adversely affect our cash flow and result of operation we are also subject to non income based tax such value added payroll sale use excise net worth property hotel occupancy and good and service tax

litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse development in these pending or future case and proceeding additionally several jurisdiction have adopted or may adopt law that require to collect and remit sale tax on behalf of travel service provider which in some instance may negatively impact our revenue adverse tax decision or new law could have material adverse effect on our business margin cash flow and result of operation an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation may encourage the commencement of additional litigation audit proceeding or other regulatory inquiry in addition an unfavorable outcome or settlement of these action or proceeding could result in substantial liability for past and or future booking including among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost we may not be able to maintain our innovation box tax benefit the netherlands corporate income tax law provides that income generated from qualifying innovative activity is taxed at the rate of innovation box tax rather than the dutch statutory rate of portion of booking com earnings currently qualifies for innovation box tax treatment in the innovation box tax benefit reduced our consolidated income tax expense by million in the dutch government approved reduction in it corporate income tax rate from to effective in furthermore the dutch government ha proposed an increase in the innovation box tax rate from to which if enacted could be effective beginning in in order to be eligible for innovation box tax treatment booking com must among other thing apply for and obtain research and development certificate from dutch governmental agency every six month confirming that the activity that booking com intends to be engaged in over the subsequent six month period are innovative the certificate is current but should booking com fail to secure such certificate in any future period for example because the governmental agency doe not view booking com new or anticipated activity innovative or should this agency determine that the activity performed in prior period were not performed contemplated or did not comply with the agency requirement booking com may lose it certificate and result the innovation box tax benefit may be reduced or eliminated booking com intends to apply for continued innovation box tax treatment for future period however booking com application may not be accepted or if accepted the amount of qualifying earnings may be reduced the loss of the innovation box tax benefit or any material portion thereof whether due to change in tax law or determination by the dutch government that booking com activity are not innovative or for any other reason would substantially increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our result of operation and cash flow we are dependent on provider of accommodation rental car and airline ticket and on restaurant we rely on provider of accommodation rental car and airline ticket and on restaurant to make their service available to consumer through our arrangement with travel service provider generally do not require them to make available any specific quantity of accommodation reservation rental car or airline ticket or to make accommodation reservation rental car or airline ticket available in any geographic area for any particular route or at any particular price similarly our arrangement with restaurant generally do not require them to provide all of their available table and reservation to customer through we are in regular dialogue with our major travel service provider about the nature and of their participation in our service significant reduction on the part of any of our major travel service provider or provider that are particularly popular with consumer in their participation in our service for sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal could have material adverse effect on our business market share and result of operation to the extent any of those major or popular travel service provider ceased to participate in our service in favor of one of our competitor service or decided to require consumer to purchase service directly from them our business market share and result of operation could be harmed during period of higher occupancy rate accommodation provider may decrease their distribution of accommodation reservation through third party intermediary like in particular through our discount service further consolidation among travel service provider increase the potential adverse effect of decision by any particular significant travel service provider such large hotel chain airline or rental car company to withdraw from or reduce it participation in our service also increase to the extent restaurant limit the availability of reservation through opentable consumer may not continue to use our service and or our revenue and result of operation could be adversely affected especially if reservation during highly desirable time on high volume day are not made available through kayak meta search service depends on access to information related to travel service pricing schedule availability and other related information from otcs and travel service provider to attract consumer many of kayak agreement with otcs and travel service provider are short term agreement that may be terminated on day notice to the extent otcs or travel service provider no longer provide such information to kayak kayak ability to provide comprehensive travel service information to consumer could be diminished and it brand business and result of operation could be harmed to the extent consumer do not view kayak reliable source of comprehensive travel service information fewer consumer would likely visit it website which would also likely have negative impact on kayak advertising revenue and result of operation in addition if otcs or travel service provider choose not to advertise with kayak or choose to reduce or eliminate the fee paid to kayak for referral from query result kayak business and result of operation could be adversely affected we rely on the performance of highly skilled employee and if we are unable to retain or motivate key employee or hire retain and motivate qualified employee our business would be harmed our performance is largely dependent on the talent and effort of highly skilled individual our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled employee for all area of our organization in particular the contribution of key senior management in the united state europe and asia are critical to the overall management of our business we may not be able to retain the service of any member of our senior management or other key employee the loss of whom could harm our business and competitive position we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy in addition competition for well qualified employee in all aspect of our business including software engineer mobile communication talent and other technology professional is intense our international success in particular ha led to increased effort by our competitor and others to hire our international employee these difficulty may be amplified by evolving restriction on immigration travel or availability of visa or work permit for skilled technology worker the competition for talent in our industry ha in the past and may in the future increase our personnel expense which may adversely affect our result of operation our continued ability to compete effectively and to innovate and develop product service technology and enhancement depends on our ability to attract new employee and to retain and motivate existing employee if we do not succeed in attracting well qualified employee or retaining training managing and motivating existing employee our business competitive position reputation and result of operation would be adversely affected our business is subject to various competition anti trust consumer protection and online commerce law rule and regulation around the world and the size of our business grows scrutiny of our business by legislator and regulator in these area may intensify we the travel industry and the technology industry generally are subject to competition anti trust and consumer protection law and regulation around the world these law and regulation evolve and change and their interpretation application and enforcement can also change be unpredictable or be affected by changing political or social pressure we expand our business into new area including our evolution towards the connected trip we may become subject to additional law and regulation at time online travel platform including have been the subject of investigation or inquiry by various national competition authority ncas or other governmental authority for example we have been and continue to be involved in investigation related to whether booking com contractual parity arrangement with accommodation provider sometimes also referred to most favored nation or mfn provision are anti competitive because they require accommodation provider to provide booking com with room rate condition or availability that are at least favorable those offered to other otcs or through the accommodation provider website to resolve and close certain of the investigation we have from time to time made commitment to the investigating authority regarding future business or activity for example booking com ha made commitment to several ncas including agreeing to narrow the scope of it parity arrangement in order to resolve parity related investigation we have also been involved in investigation or inquiry involving consumer protection matter for example in october the united kingdom nca the competition and market authority or cma launched consumer protection law investigation into the clarity accuracy and presentation of information on hotel booking site with specific focus on the display of search result ranking claim regarding discount method of pressure selling such allegedly creating false impression regarding room availability and failure to disclose hidden charge in connection with this investigation in june the cma announced that it would proceed with enforcement action against number of hotel booking site booking com agoda and kayak along with number of other otcs voluntarily agreed to certain commitment with the cma addressing it concern in resolution of this investigation which took effect on september among other thing the commitment provided to the cma include showing price inclusive of all mandatory tax and charge providing information about the effect of money earned on search result ranking on or before the search result page and making certain adjustment to how discount and statement concerning popularity or availability are shown to consumer the cma ha stated that it expects all market participant to adhere to the same standard regardless of whether they formally signed the commitment the commitment concluded the cma investigation without finding of infringement or an admission of wrongdoing by the otcs involved result of additional inquiry from other ncas in the european economic area booking com ha made similar commitment with the consumer protection cooperation network to be applicable across the beginning in june there are consumer protection investigation or inquiry in other country well including in hungary italy and brazil and other country may decide to investigate these or similar issue generally or with respect to specific business including ours and we are unable to predict the outcome of any such other investigation or inquiry to the extent that any such other investigation or inquiry result in additional commitment fine damage or other remedy our business financial condition and result of operation could be harmed market evolve and ncas or other governmental authority continue to monitor our industry new investigation of the industry generally or of specifically could and have occurred including revisiting issue that were the subject of prior investigation for example working group of european ncas france germany belgium hungary ireland italy the netherlands czech republic the united kingdom and sweden wa established by the european commission to monitor the effect of the narrow parity clause in europe this working group ha decided to keep the sector under review and ass the competitive situation in due course also while we believe that we are complying with our commitment investigating authority or third party may determine that we are not complying with the commitment we have made and decide to pursue legal action to compel compliance or seek other remedy further in september the swiss price surveillance office opened an investigation into the level of commission of booking com in switzerland and the investigation is ongoing we are cooperating with regulator where applicable but we are unable to predict what if any effect any investigation or resolution thereof including the effect of any commitment we might make will have on our business industry practice or online commerce more generally to the extent that regulatory authority impose fine on or require change to our business practice or to those currently common to the industry our business competitive position and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected negative publicity regarding competition and or consumer law investigation could adversely affect our brand and therefore our business market share and result of operation competition and consumer law related investigation legislation or issue have and could in the future result in private litigation another area of increased scrutiny particularly in europe involves contractual search term bidding restriction where one contracting party agrees not to bid on certain key search term related to the other party such other party name although we are generally moving away from these type of agreement in some of our contract we or the other party have agreed to bidding restriction if bidding restriction are held to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable or if we remove them from all of our contract our performance marketing cost may increase if bidding on affected key word especially those related to becomes more expensive which could adversely affect our performance marketing efficiency business and result of operation recently there ha been increased legislative and public focus on the technology industry especially technology company become larger in some instance country have passed legislation that go further to restrict business activity than action taken by ncas or other regulatory authority for example france italy belgium and austria have passed legislation prohibiting parity contract clause in their entirety additionally the eu platform to business regulation which come into effect in july will regulate the relationship between online platform such booking com and european business user of online platform this new regulation will require online platform to provide additional disclosure to european business partner such term related to search result ranking and preferential pricing well provide for process to handle any dispute among other change new law and regulation and changing public perception relating to the technology industry could impact our service require to change our business practice or otherwise cause to incur additional operating cost to comply with or address these development further market condition change result of investigation litigation legislation or political or social pressure we may decide to voluntarily modify our business practice beyond what is required the full effect of which may not be known when making the decision but which could harm our competitive position and adversely affect our business and result of operation with additional attention on the size of travel or technology company generally our size and market share may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisition our ability to expand into complementary business or our latitude in dealing with travel service provider such by limiting our ability to provide discount rebate or incentive or to exercise contractual right any of which could adversely affect our business result of operation or ability to grow and compete regulatory and legal requirement and uncertainty could subject to business constraint increased compliance cost and complexity or otherwise harm our business the service we offer and could offer in the future are subject to legal regulation including law ordinance rule licensing requirement and other requirement and regulation of national and local government and regulatory authority around the world many of which are evolving and subject to the possibility of new or revised interpretation our ability to provide our service is and will continue to be affected by such regulation for example we began offering optional rental car related insurance product to customer protecting them against accidental damage to their rental vehicle which subject to certain insurance regulation and related increased compliance cost and complexity any of which could negatively impact our business and result of operation law in some country relating to data localization registration travel agent and other local requirement could if applicable to adversely affect our ability to conduct business in those country any increase in the number or complexity of the law and regulation applicable to and our business could increase our compliance cost and burden and negatively affect our business and result of operation for example in the european union the package travel directive the package directive set out broad requirement such local registration certain mandatory financial guarantee industry specific value added tax regime disclosure requirement and other rule regulating the provision of travel package and linked travel arrangement the package directive also creates additional liability for provider of travel package which could be the otc for performance of the travel service within packaged trip under certain circumstance certain part of our business are already subject to the broad scope of the package directive it relates to linked travel arrangement and our offering continue to diversify and expand we may become subject to additional requirement of the package directive compliance with this directive could be costly and complex or result of these requirement we could choose to limit offering that would otherwise be beneficial for the business any of which could adversely affect our business result of operation or ability to grow and compete the implementation of unfavorable regulation or unfavorable interpretation of existing regulation by judicial or regulatory body could require to incur significant compliance cost cause the development of the affected market to become impractical and otherwise have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation for example in connection with lawsuit begun in by the association of turkish travel agency turkish court ordered in that booking com must meet certain registration requirement in order to offer turkish hotel and accommodation to turkish resident if booking com doe not successfully appeal this decision or meet the turkish registration requirement booking com will be unable to resume offering turkish hotel and accommodation to turkish resident which would continue to negatively impact our result of operation another example is that the government announced in may that it will no longer suspend the right of private party to bring litigation under title iii of the cuban liberty and solidarity libertad act of popularly known the helm burton act allowing certain individual whose property wa confiscated by the cuban government beginning in to sue anyone who traffic in the property in question in court we are defendant in number of these lawsuit which seek remedy including the value of the expropriated property generally the applicable hotel plus interest treble damage attorney fee and cost we believe that we have meritorious defense to existing and potential claim and that the result of any related litigation will not be material to our business financial condition or result of operation however litigation is uncertain and there is little judicial history or interpretation of the relevant claim and defense in particular applied to business like ours result there can be no assurance that there will not be an adverse outcome to any such litigation or that such an outcome would not result in an adverse impact on our business financial condition or result of operation certain jurisdiction particularly in europe are considering regulation intended to address the issue of overtourism including restriction that may adversely affect our ability to offer accommodation in particular alternative near city center or popular tourist destination to the extent any such regulation require online platform such ours to comply with additional restriction related to offering reservation for accommodation tour and activity or other travel service in such area we could be subject to increased legal and compliance cost and our business growth and result of operation could be adversely affected compliance with the law and regulation of multiple jurisdiction increase our cost of business these law and regulation which vary and sometimes conflict include the foreign corrupt practice act the bribery act and local law which also prohibit corrupt payment to governmental official or third party data privacy requirement labor relation law tax law anti trust or competition law or sanctioned country or sanctioned person mandate and consumer protection law violation of these law and regulation could result in fine and or criminal sanction against our officer or our employee and or prohibition on the conduct of our business any such violation could result in prohibition on our ability to offer our service in one or more country could delay or prevent potential acquisition and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion effort our ability to attract and retain employee our business and our operating result even if we comply with these law and regulation doing business in certain jurisdiction could harm our reputation and brand which could adversely affect our result of operation or stock price in addition these restriction may provide competitive advantage to our competitor unless they are also subject to comparable restriction our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risk and manage these difficulty we are also subject to variety of other regulatory legal and public policy risk and challenge in managing an organization operating in various country including those related to regulatory change or other government action additional complexity to comply with regulation in multiple jurisdiction well overlapping or inconsistent legal regime in particular with respect to tax labor consumer protection digital content advertising promotion privacy and anti trust law difficulty in transferring fund from or converting currency in certain country reduced protection for intellectual property right in some country and change in social or political condition or policy relating to wide range of sustainability topic our business ha grown substantially over the last several year we have expanded into new geography and added new service in addition we have made effort and expect to make further effort to integrate access to travel service across our various brand these change add complexity to legal and tax compliance and our internal control and our increased size and operating history may increase the likelihood that we will be subject to regulatory scrutiny or audit by tax authority in various jurisdiction in addition by virtue of booking com size and presence in the netherlands it wa recently required to establish supervisory board to oversee the strategy and operation of booking com while we do not expect the existence of the supervisory board to have significant impact on our operation under certain circumstance this governance structure could require booking com to obtain supervisory board approval in order to take certain action which could result in delay or other unanticipated strategic or operational challenge there are various risk associated with the facilitation of payment from consumer including risk related to fraud compliance with evolving rule and regulation and reliance on third party our result have been and will likely continue to be negatively impacted by consumer purchase made using fraudulent credit card claim the consumer did not authorize the purchase or consumer who have closed bank account or have insufficient fund in their bank account to satisfy payment we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit card on our platform or in connection with other fraudulent transaction on our platform well other payment dispute with consumer accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting chargebacks we must also continually implement and evolve measure to detect and reduce the risk of fraud in particular these method become increasingly sophisticated if we are unable to combat the use of fraudulent credit card on our website our business profit margin result of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected we believe that an important component of our future success will be our ability to offer consumer their preferred method of payment in the most efficient manner on all our platform and result we are increasingly processing transaction on merchant basis where we facilitate payment from traveler through the use of credit card and other payment method such paypal alipay paytm and wechat pay while processing transaction on merchant basis allows to process transaction for property that do not otherwise accept credit card and to increase our ability to offer variety of method and flexible transaction term to consumer we incur additional payment processing cost which are typically higher for foreign currency transaction and other cost related to these transaction such cost related to fraudulent payment and transaction and fraud detection our merchant transaction continue to grow in addition to the revenue from these transaction we may experience significant increase in these cost and our result of operation and profit margin could be materially adversely affected in particular if we experience significant increase in non variable cost related to fraudulent payment and transaction the growth in processing transaction on merchant basis also requires to manage our global system and process associated with these transaction on larger scale which introduces additional complexity and increase administrative burden and cost which could adversely affect our result of operation the increase in payment processing may also subject the business to additional regulation including financial service regulation or other regulatory regime applicable to highly regulated business which could result in increased compliance cost and complexity including those associated with the implementation of new or advanced internal control for example the payment service directive ha further complicated the authentication process for accepting credit card result of this directive payment made on our platform by consumer in the european economic area are subject to strong customer authentication which requires the consumer to engage in additional step to authenticate their transaction this new process could cause consumer transaction to take longer to process or otherwise inconvenience the consumer which could result in consumer choosing not to utilize our platform often or at all the implementation of this process ha resulted and may continue to result in increased compliance cost and administrative burden for our business evolves or we change the way we facilitate payment on our platform and new money transmission and online payment rule come into effect we may become subject to new payment and financial service law and regulation including those relating to money transmission license anti money laundering banking privacy and security of our process among others compliance with this changing regulatory environment could create significant additional compliance cost and burden or it could lead to modify our business plan or operation any of which could negatively impact our business result of operation and profit margin we are also subject to payment card association rule and obligation under our contract with payment card processor including the payment card industry and data security standard the standard under the standard and these association rule and obligation if information is compromised we could be liable to payment card issuer for associated expense and penalty and in some case we could be restricted in our ability to accept payment card under certain circumstance we are also subject to periodic audit self assessment and other assessment of our compliance with the standard which could result in additional expense and administrative burden in addition if we fail to follow payment card industry security standard even if no consumer information is compromised we could incur significant fine or experience significant increase in payment card transaction cost additionally compliance with the standard may not prevent all security incident if we are fined or required to pay additional processing fee or if our ability to accept payment card is restricted in any way result of our failure to comply with these payment card industry rule or otherwise it could adversely impact our business result of operation and profit margin we rely on bank and other payment processor to execute certain component of the payment process we generally pay these third party interchange fee and other processing and gateway fee to help facilitate payment from consumer to travel service provider result if we are unable to maintain our relationship with these third party on favorable term or if these fee are increased for any reason our profit margin business and result of operation could be harmed additionally if these third party experience service disruption consumer and travel service provider could have difficulty making or receiving payment which could adversely impact our reputation business and result of operation in addition in the event that one of our major travel service provider voluntarily or involuntarily declares bankruptcy we could experience an increase in chargebacks from customer with travel reservation with such travel service provider for example airline that participate in our service and declare bankruptcy or cease operation may be unable or unwilling to honor ticket sold for their flight our policy in such event is to direct customer seeking refund or exchange to the airline and or their credit card company and not to provide remedy ourselves however we have experienced in the past and could experience in the future an increase in chargebacks from customer with ticket on airline that ceased operation which could adversely impact our result of operation our stock price is highly volatile the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuation in response to factor such the following some of which are beyond our control financial or operating result that vary from the expectation of security analyst and investor or our publicly disclosed estimate quarterly variation in our financial or operating result change in expectation to our future financial or operating performance including estimate by security analyst and investor or our publicly disclosed estimate of future performance worldwide economic condition in general and in europe in particular fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate particularly between the dollar and the euro change in interest rate occurrence of significant security breach announcement of technological innovation or new service by or our competitor change in our capital structure change in market valuation of other internet or online service company announcement by or our competitor of price reduction promotion significant contract acquisition strategic partnership joint venture or capital commitment loss of major travel service provider participant such hotel chain rental car company or airline from our service change in the status of our intellectual property right lack of success in the expansion of our business model geographically business interruption such may result from natural disaster health concern such the coronavirus or other event announcement by third party of significant claim or initiation of litigation proceeding against or adverse development in pending proceeding addition or departure of key personnel and trading volume fluctuation sale of substantial number of share of our common stock including through the conversion of our convertible note could adversely affect the market price of our common stock by introducing large number of seller to the market given the volatility that exists for our share such sale could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly in addition fluctuation in our stock price and our price to earnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum hedge or day trading investor who often shift fund into and out of stock rapidly exacerbating price fluctuation in either direction particularly when viewed on quarterly basis the trading price of internet company stock in general including ours have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuation to the extent that the public perception of the prospect of internet or commerce company is negative our stock price could decline regardless of our result other broad market and industry factor may decrease the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance market fluctuation well general political and economic condition such recession interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation political instability brexit change in trade policy trade dispute or natural disaster health concern such the coronavirus or terrorist attack affecting significant market for our business such europe or the united state could cause our stock price to decline negative market condition could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or the value of our stock for purpose of acquiring other company or business we have in the past been defendant in security class action litigation security class action litigation ha often been brought against company following period of volatility in the market price of it security to the extent our stock price decline or is volatile we may in the future be the target of additional litigation this additional litigation could result in cost and divert management attention and resource either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation we face increased risk if the level of our debt increase we have substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future including through public or private offering of debt security our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have significant consequence which could include requiring the dedication of portion of our cash flow from operation to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purpose including capital expenditure share repurchase and acquisition increased vulnerability to downturn in our business to competitive pressure and to adverse change in general economic and industry condition decreased or lost ability to obtain additional financing on term acceptable to for working capital capital expenditure acquisition share repurchase or other general corporate purpose and decreased flexibility when planning for or reacting to change in our business and industry our ability to make payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic condition industry cycle and financial business and other factor affecting our result of operation and financial condition many of which are beyond our control further we may not have access to equity or debt market or other source of financing or such financing may not be available to on commercially reasonable term to repay or refinance our debt it come due or in the case of our convertible note upon conversion we face risk related to our intellectual property we regard our intellectual property critical to our success and we rely on domain name trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreement with our employee travel service provider partner and others to protect our proprietary right we have filed various application for protection of certain aspect of our intellectual property in the united state and other jurisdiction and we currently hold number of issued patent in several jurisdiction further in the future we may acquire additional patent or patent portfolio which could require significant cash expenditure however we may choose not to patent or otherwise register some of our intellectual property and instead rely on trade secret or other mean of protecting our intellectual property we have licensed in the past and may license in the future certain of our proprietary right such trademark or copyrighted material to third party and these licensee may take action that diminish the value of our proprietary right or harm our reputation we also have procured various intellectual property license from third party in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our service are made available online particularly in certain jurisdiction in which we operate in which theft of intellectual property may be more prevalent we may be required to expend significant time and resource to prevent infringement or to enforce our intellectual property right we believe that our intellectual property right help to protect our business we endeavor to defend our intellectual property right diligently but intellectual property litigation is extremely expensive and time consuming and may divert managerial attention and resource from our business objective we may not be able to successfully defend our intellectual property right or they may not be sufficient to effectively protect our business which could materially adversely affect our business brand and result of operation from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we have been subject to and are currently subject to legal proceeding and claim relating to the intellectual property right of others and we expect that third party will continue to assert intellectual property claim in particular patent claim against particularly we expand the complexity and scope of our business successful infringement claim against could result in significant monetary liability or prevent from operating our business or portion of our business or require to change business practice or develop non infringing intellectual property which could require significant effort and expense in addition resolution of claim may require to obtain license to use intellectual property right belonging to third party which may be expensive to procure or possibly to cease using those right altogether any of these event could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition value of our investment could decline which could adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation we maintain an investment portfolio of various holding type and maturity our portfolio includes marketable debt security equity security of publicly traded company the value of which are subject to market price volatility and investment in private company our investment in marketable debt security and preferred stock classified debt security for accounting purpose are generally classified available for sale and consequently are recorded in our balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gain or loss net of tax reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheet if such investment suffer market price decline we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investment below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be other than temporary see note to our consolidated financial statement for the accounting change to the other than temporary impairment model effective january for period beginning on or after january change in the fair value of our investment in publicly traded equity security are recognized in net income and these change have had and are likely to continue to have significant impact on our quarterly net income our investment in equity security other than those classified debt security for accounting purpose of private company are primarily measured at cost le impairment if any plus or minus change resulting from observable price change in orderly transaction for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer with change in value also recognized in net income see note to our consolidated financial statement we have invested significant amount in trip com group convertible note and ad we have also invested in other chinese internet company meituan dianping meituan and didi chuxing didi see note to our consolidated financial statement for more information regarding our investment in trip com group meituan and didi security the value of these security is subject to the risk associated with trip com group meituan and didi respective business well any change by the chinese government in foreign investment law or elevated scrutiny or regulation of foreign investment in chinese company for example trip com group is cayman island company operating in china through what is commonly referred to variable interest entity or vie structure where it conduct part of it business through contractual relationship with affiliated chinese entity although vie structure are commonly used by chinese internet and commerce company there are substantial uncertainty regarding the interpretation and application of people republic of china prc law and regulation to vie structure and it is possible that the prc government may view the vie structure violation of prc law vie contractual relationship are not effective in providing control over the affiliated chinese company direct ownership and trip com group would have to rely on the prc legal system to enforce those contract in the event of breach by one of these entity further conflict of interest could arise to the extent trip com group officer or director are also shareholder officer or director of the affiliated chinese entity any of these risk could materially and adversely affect trip com group business and therefore the value of our investment in trip com group similar vie structure consideration and risk apply with respect to our investment in security of meituan and didi each of which is cayman island company operating in china through vie structure our investment in private company are inherently risky in that such company are typically at an early stage of development may have no or limited revenue may not be or ever become profitable may not be able to secure additional funding or their technology service or product may not be successfully developed or introduced to the market further our ability to liquidate any such investment is typically dependent on liquidity event such public offering or acquisition no public market exists for such security valuation of privately held company are inherently complex and uncertain due to the lack of liquid market for such security if we determine that any of our investment in such company have experienced decline in value we are required to recognize the change in net income for example in we recognized impairment totaling million related to investment in two private company and in we recognized an impairment of million related to an investment in one private company we could lose the full amount of any of our investment and any impairment of our investment could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation investment in new business strategy and acquisition could disrupt our ongoing business and present risk not originally contemplated our mission is to make it easier for everyone to experience the world result our strategy involves evaluating and potentially entering complementary business in furtherance of that mission we have invested and in the future may invest in new business strategy and acquisition for example we acquired fareharbor in april to increase our ability to offer local activity and experience such tour and attraction we also have acquired and in the future may acquire business similar to those we already operate in an effort to expand our geographic market acquire technology or product or to otherwise improve or grow our business for example in july we acquired the momondo group and in november we acquired hotelscombined in each case among other thing to enhance the global reach of our meta search service endeavor may involve significant risk and uncertainty including diversion of management attention from current operation greater than expected liability and expense inadequate return on capital new risk with which we are not familiar legal compliance obligation that previously did not apply to integration risk and difficulty and unidentified issue not discovered in our investigation and evaluation of those strategy and acquisition result entering new business involves risk and cost that could if realized have an adverse effect on our business reputation result of operation profit margin cash flow or financial condition well on our ability to achieve the expected benefit of any such investment or acquisition we may decide to make minority investment including through joint venture in which we have limited or no management or operational control the controlling person in such case may have business interest strategy or goal that are inconsistent with ours and decision of the company or venture in which we invested may result in harm to our reputation or business or adversely affect the value of our investment substantial portion of our goodwill and intangible asset were acquired in acquisition if we determine that any of our goodwill and intangible asset or any goodwill or intangible asset acquired in future transaction experience decline in value we may be required to record we have in the past an impairment which could materially adversely affect our result of operation further we may issue share of our common stock in these transaction which could result in dilution to our stockholder we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired business or combine internal business the integration of acquired business requires significant time and resource and we may not manage these process successfully further our business develop and market condition change we have integrated business that had been managed independently and integrated certain function across business and we may do so in the future these integration may be of varying degree depending on many factor such business compatibility strategic goal or geographic location among others integration are complex often involve additional or unexpected cost and create variety of issue and risk including disruption or harm to the business involved disruption to our other business including result of the need for management to spend time and attention on the integration difficulty combining different company culture system reporting structure title and job description and compensation scheme problem retaining key personnel in particular at the acquired or integrated company loss of travel service provider restaurant or partner of the acquired business and difficulty implementing and maintaining effective control procedure and policy we may not successfully integrate company or achieve the strategic financial or operating objective of the acquisition or integration any of which could adversely affect our business result of operation or the value of our acquisition

report on form we evaluate certain operating and financial measure on both an reported and constant currency basis we calculate constant currency by converting our current year period financial result for transaction recorded in currency other than dollar using the corresponding prior year period monthly average exchange rate rather than the current year period monthly average exchange rate overviewour mission is to make it easier for everyone to experience the world we seek to empower people to cut through travel barrier such money time language and overwhelming option so they can use our service to easily and confidently get where they want to go stay where they want to stay dine where they want to dine pay how they want to pay and experience what they want to experience we connect consumer wishing to make travel reservation with provider of travel service around the world through our online platform through one or more of our brand consumer can book broad array of accommodation including hotel motel resort home apartment bed and breakfast hostel and other property make car rental reservation or arrange for an airport taxi make dinner reservation or book cruise flight vacation package tour or activity consumer can also use our meta search service to easily compare travel reservation information such airline ticket hotel reservation and rental car reservation information from hundred of online travel platform at once in addition we offer various other service to consumer and partner such certain travel related insurance product and restaurant management service to restaurant we offer these service through six primary consumer facing brand booking com kayak priceline agoda rentalcars com and opentable while historically our brand operated on largely independent basis and many of them focused on particular service accommodation reservation or geography we are increasing the collaboration cooperation and interdependency among our brand in our effort to provide consumer with the best and most comprehensive service we also seek to maximize the benefit of our scale by sharing resource and technological innovation co developing new service and coordinating activity in key market among our brand for example booking com the world leading brand for booking online accommodation reservation based on room night booked offer rental car and other ground transportation service flight restaurant reservation tour and activity reservation and other service many of which are supported by our other brand similarly hotel reservation available through booking com are also generally available through agoda and priceline see note to the consolidated financial statement segment reporting for information on our operating segment our result include fareharbor and hotelscombined since they were acquired in april and november respectively we refer to our company and all of our subsidiary and brand collectively booking holding the company we our or our business is driven primarily by international result which consist of the result of booking com agoda and rentalcars com and the international business of kayak and opentable this classification is independent of where the consumer resides where the consumer is physically located while using our service or the location of the travel service provider or restaurant for example reservation made through booking com at hotel in new york by consumer in the united state is part of our international result in our international business the substantial majority of which is generated by booking com represented approximately of our consolidated revenue significant majority of our revenue including significant majority of our international revenue is earned in connection with facilitating accommodation reservation see note to the consolidated financial statement for more geographic information we derive substantially all of our revenue from enabling consumer to make travel service reservation we also earn revenue from credit card processing rebate and customer processing fee advertising service restaurant reservation and restaurant management service and various other service such travel related insurance revenue recent coronavirus outbreak ha had significant and negative impact on our business during the first quarter of in particular in china and certain other asian market though concern about the coronavirus are also negatively impacting travel demand and therefore our business generally in the more affected market like china we have seen significant increase in cancellation and reduction in new booking and adrs have also been negatively affected the ultimate impact of the outbreak on our business is impossible to predict with certainty and therefore the full extent to which the coronavirus will impact our business and result of operation is unknown however decreased travel demand resulting from the outbreak ha had negative impact and is likely to have negative and material impact on our business growth and result of operation for more information see part item risk factor decline or disruption in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance over the last several year we have experienced significant growth in our accommodation reservation service we believe this growth is the result of among other thing the broader shift of travel purchase from offline to online the widespread adoption of mobile device and the growth of travel overall we also believe this growth is the result of the continued innovation and execution by our team around the world to increase the number and the variety of accommodation we offer consumer increase and improve content build distribution and improve the consumer experience on our online platform well consistently and effectively marketing our brand through performance and brand marketing effort these year over year growth rate have generally decelerated given the size of our accommodation reservation business and the general slowing growth rate of the online travel market discussed below we expect that our year over year growth rate will generally continue to decelerate though the rate of deceleration may fluctuate and there may be period of acceleration from time to time we are global business and online travel growth rate vary across the world depending on numerous factor including local and regional economic condition individual disposable income access to the internet and adoption of commerce online travel growth rate have generally slowed in market such north america and europe where online activity is high and consumer have been engaging in commerce transaction for many year while online travel growth rate remain relatively high in market such asia pacific where income are rising more quickly and the increased availability and use of mobile device ha accelerated the growth of internet usage and travel commerce transaction over the long term we expect online travel growth rate to slow market continue to mature however we believe that the opportunity to continue to grow our business exists for the market in which we operate including in both mature and fast growing market further we believe that this opportunity for growth exists because we feel we provide significant value to travel service provider regardless of size or geography due to our global reach and online marketing expertise for example we believe that accommodation provider of all size from large hotel chain to small independent hotel and alternative accommodation such home and apartment benefit from using our service which enable them to reach broader audience of potential customer our growth ha primarily been generated by the worldwide accommodation reservation business of booking com which is our most significant brand and ha been due in part to the availability of large number of property through booking com booking com included approximately property on it website at december consisting of approximately hotel motel and resort and approximately home apartment and other unique place to stay compared to approximately property including approximately hotel motel and resort and approximately home apartment and other unique place to stay at december booking com categorizes property listed on it website either hotel motel and resort which group together more traditional accommodation type including hostel and inn or home apartment and other unique place to stay also referred to alternative accommodation which encompasses all other type of accommodation including bed and breakfast villa apart hotel and beyond we intend to continue to improve the accommodation choice available for reservation on our platform however the growth rate of our accommodation may vary in part result of removing accommodation from our platform from time to time many of the newer accommodation we add to our travel reservation service especially in highly penetrated market may have fewer room or higher credit risk and may appeal to smaller subset of consumer hostel and bed and breakfast because alternative accommodation are often either single unit or small collection of independent unit these property generally represent more limited booking opportunity than hotel motel and resort which generally have more unit to rent per property further alternative accommodation in general may be subject to increased seasonality due to local tourism season or other factor or may not be available at peak time due to use by the property owner we may also experience lower profit margin with respect to these property due to certain additional cost such increased customer service cost related to offering these accommodation on our platform our alternative accommodation business ha grown these different characteristic have negatively impacted our profit margin and we expect this trend to continue to the extent these property represent an increasing percentage of the property added to our platform we expect that our room night growth rate and property growth rate will continue to diverge over time since each such property ha fewer booking opportunity result of the foregoing the percentage of alternative accommodation property increase the number of reservation per property will likely continue to decrease we believe that continuing to expand the number and variety of accommodation available through our service in particular booking com will help to continue to grow our accommodation reservation business we are constantly innovating to grow our business by among other thing providing best in class user experience with intuitive easy to use online platform website and mobile apps to ensure that we are meeting the need of online consumer while aiming to exceed their expectation part of these ongoing effort we have long term strategy to build more integrated offering of multiple element of travel which we refer to the connected trip although we expect our effort to build the connected trip may increase revenue growth over time we may see negative impact on our operating margin in the near term we incur the expense associated with these investment further to the extent our non accommodation service grow faster than our accommodation service whether part of the connected trip or otherwise our operating margin may be negatively affected if we experience an increasing mix of revenue from lower margin service part of our strategy to provide more payment option to consumer and travel service provider increase the number and variety of accommodation available on booking com and enable the growth of our in destination activity business booking com is increasingly processing transaction on merchant basis where it facilitates payment from traveler for the service provided this allows booking com to process transaction for travel service provider and to increase it ability to offer secure and flexible transaction term to consumer such the form and timing of payment we believe that adding these type of service offering will benefit consumer and travel service provider well our gross booking room night and earnings growth rate however this result in additional expense for personnel payment processing customer chargebacks including those related to fraud and other expense related to these transaction which are recorded in personnel and sale and other expense in our consolidated statement of operation well associated incremental revenue in the form of credit card rebate for example which are recorded in merchant revenue this business continues to grow we expect these expense to continue to increase which would negatively impact our operating margin despite increase in associated incremental revenue component of revenue and expense related to our merchant business may be recognized in different period these timing factor could impact our operating margin well the relationship between our gross booking and revenue in particular period especially our merchant business increase percentage of our overall business we compete globally with both online and traditional provider of travel and restaurant reservation and related service the market for the service we offer are intensely competitive constantly evolving and subject to rapid change and current and new competitor can launch new service at relatively low cost some of our current and potential competitor such google apple alibaba tencent amazon and facebook have significantly more customer or user consumer data and financial and other resource than we do and they may be able to leverage other aspect of their business search or mobile device business to enable them to compete more effectively with for example google ha entered various aspect of the online travel market and ha grown rapidly in this area including by offering flight meta search product google flight hotel meta search product google hotel ad vacation rental meta search product it book on google reservation functionality and integrating it hotel and restaurant meta search product into it google map app well google travel planning tool which aggregate it flight hotel and package product in one website our market are also subject to rapidly changing condition including technological development consumer behavior change regulatory change and travel service provider consolidation we expect these trend to continue for example we have experienced significant shift of both direct and indirect business to mobile platform and our advertising partner are also seeing rapid shift of traffic to mobile platform advertising and distribution opportunity may be more limited on mobile device given their smaller screen size in addition the revenue earned on mobile transaction may be le than typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing pattern for example accommodation reservation made on mobile device typically are for shorter length of stay have lower accommodation average daily rate adrs and are not made far in advance for more detail regarding the competitive trend and risk we face see part item business competition part item risk factor intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance and consumer adoption and use of mobile device creates challenge and may enable device company such google and apple to compete directly with and we may not be able to keep up with rapid technological or other market change although we believe that providing an extensive collection of property excellent customer service and an intuitive easy to use consumer experience are important factor influencing consumer decision to make reservation for many consumer particularly in certain market the price of the travel service is the primary factor determining whether consumer will book reservation result it is increasingly important to offer travel service such accommodation reservation at competitive price whether through discount coupon closed user group rate or loyalty program or otherwise these have resulted and in the future may result in lower adrs and lower revenue percentage of gross booking discounting and couponing coupled with high degree of consumer shopping behavior is particularly common in asian market in some case our competitor are willing to make little or no profit on transaction or offer travel service at loss in order to gain market share we have observed trend of declining constant currency accommodation adrs which we expect to continue though the rate of decline may fluctuate and there may be period of stable or increasing adrs we believe the trend of declining adrs is partially driven by the negative impact of the changing geographical mix of our business lower adr region like asia pacific are generally growing faster than higher adr region like western europe well pricing pressure within local market from time to time resulting from competitive condition weakening economic condition or change in travel pattern these declining adr trend have resulted in and may continue to result in our gross booking growing at lower rate of growth than our accommodation room night we have established widely used and recognized commerce brand through marketing and promotional campaign historically our performance marketing expense have increased significantly however more recently we have experienced more moderate growth rate trend we expect to continue our performance marketing expense is primarily related to the use of online search engine primarily google meta search and travel research service and affiliate marketing to generate traffic to our website more recently growth of some of these channel ha slowed performance marketing expense were billion billion and billion for the year ended december and respectively we also invested million million and million in brand marketing for the year ended december and respectively primarily related to cost associated with producing and airing television advertising online video advertising for example on youtube and facebook online display advertising and other brand marketing we intend to continue strategy of promoting brand awareness through both online and offline marketing effort including by expanding brand campaign into additional market which we expect will increase our brand marketing expense over time we have observed increased brand marketing by other otcs meta search service and travel service provider which may make our brand marketing effort more expensive and le effective performance marketing efficiency expressed performance marketing expense percentage of total revenue is impacted by number of factor that are subject to variability and that are in some case outside of our control including adrs cost per click cancellation rate foreign currency exchange rate our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customer and the extent to which consumer come directly to our platform for booking for example competition for desired ranking in search result and or decline in ad click by consumer could increase our cost per click and reduce our performance marketing efficiency change by google or any of our other search or meta search partner in how it present travel search result including if applicable by placing it own offering at or near the top of search result or the manner in which it conduct the auction for placement among search result may be competitively disadvantageous to and may impact our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our website we have observed long term trend of decreasing performance marketing return on investment roi more recently we have observed period of stable or increasing roi however it is uncertain whether this trend will continue or if roi will return to the prior trend of declining over time we may from time to time we did beginning in the third quarter of through the fourth quarter of pursue strategy of improving our performance marketing roi which could negatively impact growth and positively impact performance marketing efficiency and profitability when evaluating our performance marketing spend we consider several factor for each channel such the customer experience on the advertising platform the incrementality of the traffic we receive and the anticipated repeat rate from particular platform well other factor the amount of business we obtain through each performance marketing channel is impacted by numerous factor including bidding decision by and our competitor including decision to optimize performance marketing roi and the marketing effort and success of those channel to attract consumer and generate demand see part item risk factor we rely on performance and brand marketing channel to generate significant amount of traffic to our platform and grow our business and our business could be negatively affected by change in online search and meta search algorithm and dynamic or traffic generating arrangement in recent year we experienced significant increase in our cancellation rate which negatively affected our marketing efficiency and result of operation beginning in the third quarter of our cancellation rate have generally decreased which ha benefited our marketing efficiency and result of operation we believe that many factor influence cancellation rate and it is uncertain whether future cancellation rate will continue to decrease stabilize or return to their prior trend of generally increasing over time perceived or actual adverse economic condition including slow slowing or negative economic growth high or rising unemployment rate inflation and weakening currency and concern over government response such higher tax or and reduced government spending could impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand further political uncertainty condition or event such the united kingdom decision to leave the european union brexit including uncertainty in the implementation of brexit and other political concern can also negatively affect consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand at time we have experienced volatility in transaction growth rate increased cancellation rate and weaker trend in adrs across many region of the world particularly in those country that appear to be most affected by economic and political uncertainty which we believe are due at least in part to these macro economic condition and concern for more detail see part item risk factor decline or disruption in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance these and other macro economic uncertainty such geopolitical tension and differing central bank monetary policy have led to significant volatility in the exchange rate between the dollar and the euro the british pound sterling and other currency significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate stock market and oil price can also impact consumer travel behavior noted earlier our international business represents substantial majority of our financial result therefore because we report our result in dollar we face exposure to movement in foreign currency exchange rate the financial result and the financial condition of our international business are translated from local currency principally euro and british pound sterling into dollar result both the absolute amount of and percentage change in our foreign currency denominated net asset gross booking revenue operating expense and net income expressed in dollar are affected by foreign currency exchange rate change our foreign currency denominated gross booking revenue operating expense and net income expressed in dollar are lower for the year ended december than they would have been had foreign currency exchange rate remained where they were for the year ended december for example total revenue from our international operation grew for the year ended december compared to the year ended december but without the impact of change in foreign currency exchange rate grew year over year on constant currency basis by approximately since our expense are generally denominated in foreign currency on basis similar to our revenue our operating margin have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuation historically the aggregate principal value of our euro denominated long term debt and accrued interest thereon provided hedge against the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation on the net asset of one of our euro functional currency subsidiary beginning in the second quarter of we have only designated certain portion of the aggregate principal value of our euro denominated debt hedge and result we have recognized foreign currency transaction gain or loss the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on the euro denominated debt that is not designated hedging instrument for accounting purpose are recognized in foreign currency transaction and other in the consolidated statement of operation see note to our consolidated financial statement for more information see part item risk factor we are exposed to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate we generally enter into derivative instrument to minimize the impact of short term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our consolidated operating result into dollar however such derivative instrument are short term in nature and not designed to hedge against currency fluctuation that could impact growth rate for our gross booking or revenue see note to our consolidated financial statement for additional information on our derivative contract many taxing authority are increasingly focused on way to increase tax revenue and have targeted large multinational technology company in these effort result many country have implemented or are considering adoption of digital service tax that imposes tax on revenue earned from digital advertisement and the use of online platform even when there is no physical presence in the jurisdiction currently rate for this tax range from to of revenue deemed generated in the jurisdiction the digital service tax currently in effect have negatively impacted our result of operation and if many other country pas similar legislation the collective impact of all of these measure could have materially adverse impact on our result of operation and cash flow for more information see note to our consolidated financial statement and part item risk factor we may have exposure to additional tax liability many national government have conducted or are conducting investigation into competitive practice within the online travel industry and we may be involved or affected by such investigation and their result some country have adopted or proposed legislation that could also affect business practice within the online travel industry for example france italy belgium and austria have passed legislation prohibiting parity contract clause in their entirety also number of government are investigating or conducting information gathering exercise with respect to compliance by otcs with consumer protection law including practice related to the display of search result and search ranking algorithm claim regarding discount disclosure of charge and availability and similar messaging for more information on these investigation and their potential effect on our business see note to our consolidated financial statement and part item risk factor our business is subject to various competition anti trust consumer protection and online commerce law and regulation around the world and the size of our business grows scrutiny of our business by legislator and regulator in these area may intensify in addition to the price parity and consumer protection investigation from time to time national competition authority other governmental agency trade association and private party take legal action including commencing legal proceeding that may affect our operation in general increased regulatory focus on online business including online travel business like ours could result in increased compliance cost or otherwise adversely affect our business seasonalitythe majority of our gross booking are generated in the first half of the year consumer plan and reserve their spring and summer vacation in europe and north america however we generally recognize revenue from these booking when the travel begin at check in which can be in quarter other than when the associated reservation are booked in contrast we expense the substantial majority of our marketing activity the expense is incurred which in the case of performance marketing in particular is typically in the quarter in which associated reservation are booked result of this potential timing difference between when we record marketing expense and when we recognize associated revenue we experience our highest level of profitability in the third quarter of the year which is when we experience the highest level of accommodation check in for the year for our european and north american business the first quarter of the year is typically our lowest level of profitability and may experience additional volatility in earnings growth rate due to these seasonal timing factor for our asia pacific business we experience the highest level of accommodation check in in the fourth quarter the relative growth rate for our business fluctuate the quarterly distribution of our operating result may vary for several year we experienced an expansion of the booking window the average time between the making of travel reservation and the travel which impact the relationship between our gross booking recognized at the time of booking and our revenue recognized at the time of check in however we saw contraction of the booking window throughout and future change in the length of the booking window will affect the degree to which our gross booking and revenue occur in the same period and result whether our gross booking growth rate and revenue growth rate converge or diverge in addition the date on which certain holiday fall can have an impact on our quarterly result for example in easter fell on april and easter related travel began in the second quarter when the associated revenue wa recognized by comparison in easter wa on april and meaningful amount of easter related travel began in the week leading up to the holiday with the associated revenue being recognized in the first quarter of result of the shift in easter timing relative to our first quarter year over year growth rate in revenue operating income and operating margin were negatively impacted and our second quarter year over year growth rate were positively impacted the timing of other holiday such ramadan can also impact our quarterly year over year growth rate the impact of seasonality can be exaggerated in the short term by the gross booking growth rate of the business for example in period where our gross booking growth rate substantially decelerates our operating margin typically benefit from relatively le variable marketing expense in addition revenue growth is typically le impacted by decelerating gross booking growth in the near term due to the benefit of revenue related to reservation booked in previous quarter but any such deceleration would negatively impact revenue growth in subsequent period conversely in period where our gross booking growth rate accelerates our operating margin are typically negatively impacted by relatively more variable marketing expense in addition revenue growth is typically le impacted by accelerating gross booking growth in the near term but any such acceleration would positively impact revenue growth in subsequent period portion of the revenue recognized from such gross booking will occur in future quarter other factorswe believe that our future success depends in large part on our ability to continue to profitably grow our brand worldwide and over time to offer other travel and travel related service factor beyond our control such oil price stock market volatility terrorist attack unusual or extreme weather or natural disaster such earthquake hurricane tsunami flood fire drought and volcanic eruption travel related health concern including pandemic and epidemic such coronaviruses ebola and zika political instability change in economic condition war and regional hostility imposition of tax tariff or surcharge by regulatory authority change in trade policy or trade dispute change in immigration policy or travel related accident or increased focus on the environmental impact of travel can disrupt travel limit the ability or willingness of traveler to visit certain location or otherwise result in decline in travel demand these kind of event have negatively affected our business and result of operation in the past and may do so in the future because these event or concern and the full impact of their effect are largely unpredictable they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumer and therefore demand for our service and our relationship with travel service provider and other any of which can adversely affect our business and result of operation see part item risk factor decline or disruption in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance we intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion technology and personnel within parameter consistent with attempt to improve long term operating result even if those expenditure create pressure on operating margin we have experienced pressure on operating margin we invest in initiative to drive future growth we also intend to broaden the scope of our business and to that end we explore strategic alternative from time to time in the form of among other thing acquisition the overall size of our business ha grown the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass wider range of service and technology including service and technology that may be outside of our historical core business and our ability to keep pace may slow potential competitor such emerging start ups may be able to innovate and focus on developing particularly new product or service faster than we can or may foresee consumer need for new service or technology before some of our larger competitor or potential competitor have more resource or more established or diversified relationship with consumer than we do and they could use these advantage in way that could affect our competitive position including by making acquisition entering or investing in travel reservation business investing in research and development and competing aggressively for highly skilled employee for example because consumer often utilize other online service more frequently than online travel service competitor or potential competitor that ha established other more frequent online interaction with consumer may be able to more easily or cost effectively acquire customer for it online travel service than we can our goal is to grow revenue and achieve healthy operating margin in an effort to maintain profitability the uncertain and highly competitive environment in which we operate make the prediction of future result of operation difficult and accordingly we may not be able to sustain revenue growth and profitability critical accounting policy and estimatesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation is based upon our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state gaap our significant accounting policy and estimate are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statement certain of our accounting estimate are particularly important to our financial position and result of operation and require to make difficult and subjective judgment often result of the need to make estimate of matter that are inherently uncertain our management us it judgment to determine the appropriate assumption to be used in the determination of certain estimate we evaluate our estimate on an ongoing basis estimate are based on among other thing historical experience term of existing contract our observance of trend in the travel industry and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance our actual result may differ from these estimate under different assumption or condition our critical accounting policy that involve significant estimate and judgment of management include the following valuation of goodwill and other long lived asset the application of the acquisition accounting for business combination requires the use of significant estimate and assumption to determine the fair value of the asset acquired and liability assumed our estimate of the fair value are based upon assumption that we believe are reasonable when we deem appropriate we utilize assistance from third party valuation firm the consideration transferred is allocated to the asset acquired and liability assumed based on their respective fair value at the acquisition date the excess of the consideration transferred over the net of the amount allocated to the identifiable asset acquired and liability assumed is recognized goodwill goodwill is assigned to reporting unit that are expected to benefit from the synergy of the business combination of the acquisition date we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable substantial portion of our intangible asset and goodwill relates to the acquisition of opentable and kayak at september we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing and concluded that there wa no impairment of goodwill and that the fair value of our reporting unit substantially exceeded their respective carrying value at september since the annual impairment test there have been no event or change in circumstance to indicate potential impairment to our goodwill we review long lived asset whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based upon our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the estimated undiscounted future net cash flow before interest and tax of the related asset group we did not identify any impairment indicator for our long lived asset at december income tax we determine our tax expense based on our income and statutory tax rate applicable in the various jurisdiction in which we operate due to the complex nature of tax legislation and frequent change with such associated legislation significant judgment is required in computing our tax expense and determining our tax position in december the government enacted the tax cut and job act the tax act the tax act made significant change to federal tax law including reduction in the federal statutory tax rate from to effective january the tax act imposed one time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated unremitted international earnings to be paid over eight year the tax act also introduced in tax on of global intangible low taxed income gilti which is income determined to be in excess of specified routine rate of return and base erosion and anti abuse tax beat aimed at preventing the erosion of the tax base we have adopted an accounting policy to treat tax on gilti period cost in december staff accounting bulletin no sab wa issued by the security and exchange commission to address the application of gaap in situation when the registrant doe not have all the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computation in reasonable detail to complete it accounting for the change in tax law in accordance with sab to the extent registrant can reasonably estimate the effect of the tax act provisional tax amount can be recorded but must have been finalized prior to december in we completed our accounting for the income tax effect of the tax act based on technical guidance issued by federal and state tax authority available at that time which resulted in an income tax benefit of million in result of additional technical guidance issued by federal and state tax authority we recorded an additional income tax benefit of million to adjust our income tax expense relating to the federal one time deemed repatriation liability well state income tax associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest our international earnings that were subject to taxation pursuant to the mandatory deemed repatriation or subject to taxation gilti we regularly review our deferred tax asset for recoverability considering historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversal of temporary difference and tax planning strategy and record valuation allowance required we are subject to ongoing tax examination and assessment in various jurisdiction to date we have been audited in several taxing jurisdiction with no significant impact on our result of operation although we believe that our tax filing position comply with applicable law the final determination of tax audit or tax dispute may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accrual accordingly we may incur additional tax expense based upon our assessment of the more likely than not outcome or we may adjust previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination result see note to our consolidated financial statement for further information recent accounting pronouncement see note to our consolidated financial statement for detail which is incorporated into this item by reference thereto of operation year ended december compared to year ended december evaluate certain operating and financial measure on both an reported and constant currency basis we calculate constant currency by converting our current year period financial result for transaction recorded in currency other than dollar using the corresponding prior year period monthly average exchange rate rather than the current year period monthly average exchange rate operating and statistical metric our financial result are driven by certain operating metric that encompass the booking and other business activity generated by our travel and travel related service specifically reservation of accommodation room night rental car day and airline ticket capture the volume of unit booked through our otc brand by our travel reservation service customer gross booking is an operating and statistical metric that capture the total dollar value generally inclusive of tax and fee of all travel service booked through our otc brand by our customer net of cancellation and is widely used in the travel business our non otc brand kayak and opentable have different business metric from those of our otc brand and therefore search query through kayak and restaurant reservation through opentable do not contribute to our gross booking accommodation room night rental car day and airline ticket reserved through our service for the year ended december and were follows year ended december in million increaseroom rental car airline accommodation room night reservation increased by for the year ended december compared to the year ended december

claim are unpaid income and value added tax in december the french tax authority issued booking com assessment related to tax year through for approximately million euro the majority of which represents penalty and interest result of formal demand from the french tax authority for payment of the amount assessed for the year through in january we paid the assessment of approximately million euro million in order to preserve our right to contest those assessment in court the payment which is included in other asset in the consolidated balance sheet at december doe not constitute an

in france attributable to permanent establishment in france furthermore the french tax authority have issued assessment totaling million euro million including interest and penalty for certain tax year between and on booking com french subsidiary asserting that the subsidiary did not receive sufficient compensation for the service it rendered to booking com in the netherlands we have not recorded liability in connection with any of the french tax assessment we believe that booking com ha been and continues to be in compliance with french tax law and we are contesting the assessment additional assessment could result when the french tax authority complete the outstanding audit see note to our consolidated financial statement and part item risk factor we may have exposure to

aggregate principal amount of our senior note outstanding at december and cumulative interest to maturity of million convertible debt doe not reflect the market value in excess of the outstanding principal amount because we can settle the conversion premium amount in cash or share of common stock at our option see note to our consolidated financial statement standby letter of credit and bank guarantee issued on behalf of the company at december are primarily related to payment guarantee to third party payment processor see note and represents commitment fee on undrawn balance available under the revolving credit facility and fee on outstanding letter of credit at december we reported other long term liability of million in the consolidated balance sheet at december the majority of which relates to unrecognized tax benefit of million see note to our consolidated financial statement we have excluded these long term liability from the contractual obligation table above variety of factor could affect the timing of payment for the liability therefore we can not reasonably estimate the timing of such payment we believe that these matter will likely not be resolved in the next twelve month and accordingly we have classified the estimated liability non current in the consolidated balance sheet in we entered into an agreement to sign future lease related to approximately square foot of office space in the city of manchester in the united kingdom for the future headquarters of rentalcars com our obligation to execute the lease is conditional upon the lessor completing certain activity which are expected to be completed in if these activity are completed the lease will commence for term of approximately year and we will have lease obligation of approximately million british pound sterling million excluding lease incentive we will also make capital expenditure to fit out and furnish the office space the obligation is not included in the table of contractual obligation presented above we believe that our existing cash balance and liquid resource will be sufficient to fund our operating activity capital expenditure and other obligation through at least the next twelve month however if during that period or thereafter we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operation or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amount and on term acceptable to we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditure and scale back the scope of our business plan either of which could have material adverse effect on our future financial condition or result of operation if additional fund were raised through the issuance of equity security the percentage ownership of our current stockholder would be diluted we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operation in the future revenue growth sustained profitability may not be realized and future borrowing or equity sale may not be available in amount sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditure finance our strategy or repay our indebtedness off balance sheet arrangement at december we did not have any off balance sheet arrangement that have or are reasonably likely to have current or future effect on our financial condition result of operation liquidity capital expenditure or capital resource item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have exposure to several type of market risk change in interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and equity price we manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policy and procedure and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instrument we use foreign currency exchange derivative contract to manage short term foreign currency risk the objective of our policy is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and fair value exposure resulting from possible future adverse fluctuation in rate we evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near term and long term fluctuation in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate this evaluation includes the review of leading market indicator discussion with financial analyst and investment banker regarding current and future economic condition and the review of market projection to expected future rate we utilize this information to determine our own investment strategy well to determine if the use of derivative financial instrument is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face our policy doe not allow speculation in derivative instrument for profit or execution of derivative instrument contract for which there are no underlying exposure we do not use financial instrument for trading purpose and are not party to any leveraged derivative to the extent that change in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate affect general economic condition we would also be affected by such change we did not experience any material change in interest rate exposure during the year ended december our investment in marketable debt security are subject to unrealized gain and loss due to interest rate volatility we performed sensitivity analysis to determine the impact change in interest rate would have on the fair value of our investment in marketable debt security assuming an adverse change of basis point hypothetical basis point increase in interest rate would have resulted in decrease in the fair value of our investment of approximately million and million at
