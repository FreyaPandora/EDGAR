reason result we recognize revenue from these contract ratably over time therefore we believe that purchase order or backlog are not necessarily reliable indicator of future sale seasonalityhistorically our net revenue ha typically been higher in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half primarily due to seasonality in our wireless communication product these product have historically experienced seasonality due to launch of new mobile handset manufactured by our oem customer however from time to time typical seasonality and industry cyclicality are overshadowed by other factor such wider macroeconomic effect the timing of significant product transition and launch by large oems particularly with our wireless communication product we have diversified business portfolio and we believe that our overall revenue is le susceptible to seasonal variation result of this diversification other informationbroadcom wa incorporated in delaware in

financial result are subject to various risk and uncertainty including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition result of operation cash flow and the trading price of our common stock and preferred stock the following important factor among others could cause our actual result to differ materially from historical result and those expressed in forward looking statement made by or on our behalf in filing with the sec press release communication with investor and oral statement risk related to our businessthe majority of our sale come from small number of customer and reduction in demand or loss of one or more of our significant customer may adversely affect our business we are dependent on small number of end customer oems their respective contract manufacturer and certain distributor for majority of our business revenue and result of operation for fiscal year and sale to distributor accounted for and of our net revenue respectively direct sale to wt microelectronics accounted for of our net revenue for fiscal year we believe our aggregate sale to our top five end customer through all channel accounted for more than and more than of our net revenue for fiscal year and respectively we believe aggregate sale to apple inc through all channel accounted for approximately of our net revenue for fiscal year and approximately for fiscal year this customer concentration increase the risk of quarterly fluctuation in our operating result and our sensitivity to any material adverse development experienced by our significant customer in addition our top customer purchasing power ha in some case given them the ability to make greater demand on with regard to pricing and contractual term in general we expect this trend to continue which may adversely affect our gross margin on certain product and should we fail to comply with such term might also result in substantial liability that could harm our business financial condition and result of operation moreover the term and condition under which we do business with most of our semiconductor customer generally do not include commitment by those customer to purchase any specific quantity of product from even in those instance where we enter into an arrangement under which customer agrees to source an agreed portion of it product need from provided that we are able to meet specified development supply and quality commitment the arrangement often includes pricing schedule or methodology that apply regardless of the volume of product purchased and those customer may not purchase the amount of product we expect result we may not generate the amount of revenue or the level of profitability we expect under such arrangement if we do not perform under these arrangement we could also be liable for significant monetary damage in addition we are selling an increasing amount of our semiconductor product through limited number of distributor which may expose to additional customer concentration and related credit risk the loss of or any substantial reduction in sale to any of our major customer could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow dependence on contract manufacturing and supplier of critical component within our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring product to market damage our reputation and adversely affect our result of operation we operate primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes third party wafer foundry and module assembly and test capability referred to contract manufacturer our semiconductor product require semiconductor wafer manufacturer with state of the art fabrication equipment and technique and most of our product are designed to be manufactured in specific process typically at one particular fab or foundry either our own or with particular contract manufacturer we depend on our contract manufacturer to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our need to produce product of acceptable quality at acceptable yield and to deliver those product to on timely basis although we often have long term contract with our contract manufacturer we do not generally have long term capacity commitment we obtain substantially all of our manufacturing service on purchase order basis and our contract manufacturer have no obligation to provide with any specified minimum quantity of product further from time to time our contract manufacturer will cease to or will become unable to manufacture component for the lead time needed to identify qualify and establish reliable production at acceptable yield with new contract manufacturer is typically lengthy there is often no readily available alternative source for the wafer or other contract manufacturing service we require and there may be other constraint on our ability to change contract manufacturer in addition qualifying such contract manufacturer is often expensive and they may not produce product cost effectively our current supplier which would reduce our margin in any such circumstance we may be unable to meet our customer demand and may fail to meet our contractual obligation this could result in the payment of significant damage by to our customer and our net revenue could decline adversely affecting our business financial condition and result of operation of contentswe utilize tsmc to produce the substantial majority of our semiconductor wafer tsmc manufactured approximately of the wafer manufactured by our contract manufacturer during fiscal year our wafer requirement represent significant portion of the total production capacity of tsmc however tsmc also fabricates wafer for other company including certain of our competitor and could choose to prioritize capacity for other customer or reduce or eliminate delivery to on short notice or raise their price to all of which could harm our business result of operation and gross margin any substantial disruption in tsmc supply of wafer to or in the other contract manufacturing service that we utilize result of natural disaster political unrest military conflict economic instability equipment failure or other cause could materially harm our business customer relationship and result of operation we also depend on our contract manufacturer to timely develop new advanced manufacturing process including in the case of wafer fabrication transition to smaller geometry process technology if these new process are not timely developed or we do not have sufficient access to them we may be unable to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the extent our competitor or to deliver product to our customer which could result in loss of revenue opportunity and damage our relationship with our customer we purchase significant amount of the material used in our product from limited number of supplier our manufacturing process and those of our contract manufacturer rely on many material including silicon gallium arsenide and indium phosphide wafer copper lead frame precious and rare earth metal mold compound ceramic package and various chemical and gas we purchase significant portion of our semiconductor material component and finished good used in our product from few material provider some of which are single source supplier during the fiscal year we purchased more than two third of the material for our manufacturing process from five material provider substantially all of our purchase are on purchase order basis and we do not generally have long term contract with our material provider supplier may extend lead time limit supply or increase price due to commodity price increase capacity constraint or other factor which may lead to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry in the event that we can not timely obtain sufficient quantity of material or at reasonable price the quality of the material deteriorates or we are not able to pas on higher material or energy cost to our customer our business financial condition and result of operation could be adversely impacted adverse global economic condition could have negative effect on our business result of operation and financial condition and liquidity general slowdown in the global economy or in particular region or industry an increase in trade tension with trading partner or tightening of the credit market could negatively impact our business financial condition and liquidity adverse global economic condition have from time to time caused or exacerbated significant slowdown in the industry and market in which we operate which have adversely affected our business and result of operation in recent period investor and customer concern about the global economic outlook have adversely affected market and business condition in general macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for to accurately forecast revenue gross margin and expense and may make it more difficult to raise or refinance debt an escalation of recent trade tension between the and china ha resulted in trade restriction and increased tariff that harm our ability to participate in chinese market or compete effectively with chinese company sustained uncertainty about or worsening of current global economic condition and further escalation of trade tension between the and it trading partner especially china could result in global economic slowdown and long term change to global trade such event may also cause our customer and consumer to reduce delay or forgo technology spending ii result in customer sourcing product from other supplier not subject to such restriction or tariff iii lead to the insolvency or consolidation of key supplier and customer and iv intensify pricing pressure any or all of these factor could negatively affect demand for our product and our business financial condition and result of operation our business financial condition and result of operation could be adversely affected by the political and economic condition of the country in which we conduct business and other factor related to our international operation majority of our product are produced sourced and sold internationally and our international revenue represents significant percentage of our overall revenue in addition of november approximately of our employee are located outside the multiple factor relating to our international operation and to particular country in which we operate could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation these factor include change in political regulatory legal or economic condition or geopolitical turmoil including terrorism war or political or military coup or civil disturbance or political instability of content restrictive governmental action such restriction on the transfer or repatriation of fund and foreign investment data privacy regulation and trade protection measure including increasing protectionism import export restriction import export duty and quota trade sanction and custom duty and tariff all of which have increased under the current administration difficulty in obtaining product distribution and support and transportation delay potential inability to localize software product for significant number of international market difficulty in conducting due diligence with respect to business partner in certain international market public health or safety concern nationalization of business and expropriation of asset and change in tax law significant legal risk associated with conducting business internationally is compliance with the various and differing law and regulation including anti corruption and anti bribery law and regulation of the country in which we do business antitrust and competition law data privacy law money laundering regulation and export regulation in addition the law in various country are constantly evolving and may in some case conflict with each other although our code of ethic and business conduct and other policy prohibit our employee and our agent from engaging in unethical business practice there can be no assurance that all of our employee distributor or other agent will refrain from acting in violation of our related anti corruption policy and procedure any such violation could have material adverse effect on our business we may pursue acquisition investment joint venture and disposition which could adversely affect our result of operation our growth strategy includes the acquisition of and investment in business that offer complementary product service and technology augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capability such our recent acquisition of the symantec business we may also enter into strategic alliance or joint venture to achieve these goal we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment alliance or joint venture opportunity or to consummate any such transaction in addition our original estimate and assumption used in assessing any transaction may be inaccurate and we may not realize the expected financial or strategic benefit of any such transaction including our recent acquisition of the symantec business any acquisition we may undertake and their integration including our recent acquisition of the symantec business involve risk and uncertainty such unexpected delay challenge and related expense and disruption of our business diversion of management attention from daily operation and the pursuit of other opportunity our ability to effectively identify and timely transfer acquired asset and liability the need to assign or novate acquired customer contract our ability to identify and directly hire acquired company or business employee our ability to identify manage and coordinate the performance of acquired company or business personnel providing service to on transitional basis or under third party transition service agreement incurring significant restructuring charge and amortization expense assuming liability and ongoing lawsuit potential impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible asset and increasing our expense and working capital requirement implementing our management information system operating system and internal control for the acquired operation our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issue with the acquired company product financial disclosure accounting practice legal tax and other contingency compliance with local law and regulation and interpretation thereof in multiple international jurisdiction well compliance with law and regulation additional acquisition related debt which could increase our leverage and potentially negatively affect our credit rating resulting in more restrictive borrowing term or increased borrowing cost thereby limiting our ability to borrow and dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholder of contentsin addition regulatory approval required in connection with an acquisition such those from the department of justice the federal trade commission ftc the european commission directorate general for competition or where applicable the china state administration for market regulation may take longer than anticipated to obtain may not be obtained at all or may contain materially burdensome condition if any condition or change to the structure of an acquisition are required to obtain these regulatory approval they may have the effect of jeopardizing or delaying completion of such acquisition or reducing our anticipated benefit of the transaction if we agree to any material condition in order to obtain any such approval or if we fail to comply with any such condition our business and result of operation may be adversely affected these difficulty may be complicated by factor such the size of the business or entity acquired geographic and cultural difference lack of experience operating in the industry or geographic market of the acquired business potential loss of key employee and customer the potential for deficiency in internal control at the acquired or combined business performance problem with the acquired business technology failure to realize the benefit of transition service arrangement exposure to unanticipated liability of the acquired business insufficient revenue to offset increased expense associated with the acquisition adverse tax consequence and our potential inability to achieve the growth prospect or synergy expected from any such acquisition if we fail to complete an announced acquisition our stock price could fall to the extent the price reflects an assumption that such acquisition will be completed and we may incur significant unrecoverable cost further the failure to consummate an acquisition may result in negative publicity and adversely impact our relationship with our customer vendor and employee we may become subject to legal proceeding relating to the acquisition and the integration of acquired business may not be successful failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired business achieve anticipated level of profitability of the acquired business improve margin of the acquired business and product or realize other anticipated benefit of an acquisition could materially harm our business operating result and margin from time to time we may also seek to divest or wind portion of our business either acquired or otherwise or we may exit minority investment each of which could materially affect our cash flow and result of operation any future disposition we may make could involve risk and uncertainty including our ability to sell such business on term acceptable to or at all in addition any such disposition could result in disruption to other part of our business potential loss of employee or customer or exposure to unanticipated liability or ongoing obligation to following any such disposition for example in connection with such disposition we often enter into transition service agreement or other strategic relationship including long term research and development arrangement and sale arrangement or agree to provide certain indemnity to the purchaser which may result in additional expense and may adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation in addition disposition may include the transfer of technology and or the licensing of certain ip right to third party purchaser which could limit our ability to utilize such ip right or assert these right against such third party purchaser or other third party our business is subject to various governmental regulation and compliance with these regulation may cause to incur significant expense if we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulation we may be forced to cease the manufacture and distribution of certain product and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalty our business is subject to various international law and other legal requirement including packaging product content labor and import export regulation such the export administration regulation and applicable executive order and many of our semiconductor product are regulated or sold into regulated industry these law regulation and order are complex may change frequently and with limited notice have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified under the current administration especially in light of recent trade tension with china we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with or to remedy violation of these regulation in addition if our customer fail to comply with these regulation we may be required to suspend sale to these customer which could damage our reputation and negatively impact our result of operation for example on may the department of commerce added huawei technology co ltd one of our customer to it entity list and placed certain export restriction on huawei and it supplier which required to suspend certain sale to huawei during the pendency of such restriction and which ha had corresponding adverse effect on our revenue in addition the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductor must comply with various law and adapt to change in regulatory requirement they occur for example if country in which our product are manufactured or sold set technical standard that are not widely shared it may require to stop distributing our product commercially they comply with such new standard lead certain of our customer to suspend import of their product into that country require manufacturer in that country to manufacture product with different technical standard and disrupt cross border manufacturing relationship any of which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation if we fail to comply with these requirement we could also be required to pay civil penalty or face criminal prosecution in addition it is expected that the current administration trade policy will promote manufacturing and of contentsmanufacturers it is unclear effect this will have on multinational company that conduct business world wide or on our supplier customer contract manufacturer and oems our product and operation are also subject to the rule of industrial standard body like the international standard organization well regulation by other agency such the ftc if we fail to adequately address any of these rule or regulation our business could be harmed we are subject to risk associated with our distributor and other channel partner including product inventory level and product sell through we sell our product through direct sale force and select network of distributor and other channel partner globally sale to distributor accounted for of our net revenue in fiscal year and are subject to number of risk including fluctuation in demand based on our distributor product inventory level and end customer demand in given quarter our distributor and other channel partner are generally not subject to minimum sale requirement or any obligation to market our product to their customer our distributor and other channel partner agreement are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our product to end customer our distributor and other channel partner may market and distribute competing product and may from time to time place greater emphasis on the sale of these product due to pricing promotion and other term offered by our competitor and dependence on limited number of semiconductor distributor may exacerbate the foregoing risk and increase our related credit risk one of our significant distributor tech data corporation recently agreed to be acquired by private equity firm which may result in change in their operation business focus and financial capacity if and when completed this could adversely affect our relationship with and ability to sell product to them we do not always have direct relationship with the end customer of our product result our semiconductor product may be used in application for which they were not necessarily designed or tested including for example medical device and they may not perform anticipated in such application in such event failure of even small number of part could result in significant liability to damage our reputation and harm our business and result of operation our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing member of our senior management team our success depends in large part on the continued contribution of our senior management team and in particular the service of mr hock tan our president and chief executive officer effective succession planning is also important for our long term success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transition involving senior management could hinder our strategic planning and execution none of our senior management is bound by written employment contract in addition we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our senior management the loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market condition in which we operate if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel especially our engineering and technical personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively our future success depends on our ability to retain attract and motivate qualified personnel we also seek to acquire talented engineering and technical personnel including cybersecurity expert well effective sale professional through acquisition we may make from time to time or otherwise we have historically encountered some difficulty in hiring and retaining qualified engineer particularly in silicon valley and southeast asia where qualified engineer are in high demand in addition current or future immigration law may make it more difficult to hire or retain qualified engineer further limiting the pool of available talent further our employee including employee we have retained result of an acquisition may decide not to continue working for and may leave with little or no notice the source of our technological and product innovation our engineering and technical personnel are significant asset we have granted multi year equity award to most of our employee these award approximate four consecutive annual grant that vest in four tranche with successive four year vesting period while we believe these award provide powerful long term retention incentive to employee we may be incorrect in this assumption particularly if there is material and persistent decline in the price of our stock in addition we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approval of future equity compensation plan result we may be limited in granting equity based incentive and may impair our effort to attract and retain necessary of contentspersonnel any inability to retain attract or motivate such personnel could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation we may be involved in legal proceeding including ip anti competition and security litigation employee related claim and regulatory investigation which could among other thing divert effort of management and result in significant expense and loss of our ip right we are often involved in legal proceeding including case involving our ip right and those of others anti competition and commercial matter acquisition related suit security class action suit employee related claim and other action some of these action may seek injunctive relief including injunction or exclusion order against the sale of our product and substantial monetary damage which if granted or awarded could materially harm our business financial condition and result of operation from time to time we may also be involved or required to participate in regulatory investigation or inquiry such the ongoing investigation by the ftc and the european commission into certain of our contracting practice which may evolve into legal or other administrative proceeding litigation or settlement of such action regardless of their merit or involvement in regulatory investigation or inquiry can be complex can extend for protracted period of time can divert the effort and attention of our management and technical personnel and is frequently costly with the related expenditure unpredictable an unfavorable resolution of governmental investigation may include among others fine or other order to disgorge profit or make other payment and or the issuance of order to cease certain conduct and or modify our contracting practice any or all of which could materially adversely affect our reputation and our business financial condition and result of operation the industry in which we operate are characterized by company holding large number of patent copyright trademark and trade secret and by the vigorous pursuit protection and enforcement of ip right including action by patent holding company that do not make or sell product from time to time third party assert against and our customer and distributor their patent copyright trademark trade secret and other ip right to technology that are important to our business many of our customer agreement and in some case our asset sale agreement and or the law of certain jurisdiction may require to indemnify our customer or purchaser for third party ip infringement claim including cost to defend those claim and payment of damage in the case of adverse ruling however our contract manufacturer and supplier may or may not be required to indemnify should we or our customer be subject to such third party claim claim of this sort could also harm our relationship with our customer and might deter future customer from doing business with we do not know whether we will prevail in such proceeding given the complex technical issue and inherent uncertainty in ip litigation if any pending or future proceeding result in an adverse outcome we could be required to cease the manufacture use or sale of the infringing product process or technology and or make change to our process or product pay substantial damage for past present and future use of the infringing technology expend significant resource to develop non infringing technology license technology from the third party claiming infringement which license may not be available on commercially reasonable term or at all enter into cross license with our competitor which could weaken our overall ip portfolio and our ability to compete in particular product category indemnify our customer or distributor and or recall or accept the return of infringing product pay substantial damage to our direct or end customer to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non infringing technology or relinquish ip right associated with one or more of our patent claim if such claim are held invalid or otherwise unenforceable any of the foregoing result could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation in addition we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former director or employee or former director or employee of company that we have acquired in connection with litigation or regulatory investigation these liability could be substantial and may include among other thing the cost of defending lawsuit against these individual well stockholder derivative suit the cost of government law enforcement or regulatory investigation civil or criminal fine and penalty legal and other expense and expense associated with the remedial measure if any which may be imposed of contentsour operating result are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuation our operating result have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future these fluctuation may occur on quarterly and annual basis and are due to number of factor many of which are beyond our control these factor include among others customer concentration and the gain or loss of significant customer the timing of launch by our customer of new product such mobile handset in which our product are included and change in end user demand for the product manufactured and sold by our customer change in our product mix or customer mix and their effect on our gross margin the shift to cloud based it solution and service such hyperscale computing which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sale of our product for use in traditional enterprise data center the timing of receipt reduction or cancellation of significant product order by customer the timing of new software contract and renewal well the timing of any termination of software contract that require to refund to customer any pre paid amount under the contract which may adversely affect our cash flow fluctuation in the level of component or product inventory held by our customer utilization of our internal manufacturing facility and fluctuation in manufacturing yield our ability to successfully and timely integrate and realize the benefit of acquisition we may make and the timing of acquisition or disposition of or making and exiting investment in other entity business or technology our ability to develop introduce and market new product and technology on timely basis the timing and extent of our software license and subscription revenue and other non product revenue such product development revenue and royalty and other payment from ip sale and licensing arrangement new product announcement and introduction by or our competitor seasonality or other fluctuation in demand in our market ip dispute and associated litigation expense timing and amount of research and development and related new product expenditure and the timing of receipt of any research and development grant monies significant warranty claim including those not covered by our supplier or our insurer availability and cost of raw material and component from our supplier timing of any regulatory change particularly with respect to trade sanction and custom duty and tariff and tax reform fluctuation in currency exchange and interest rate change in taxation of international business which could increase our overall cash tax cost change in our tax structure or incentive arrangement which may adversely affect our net tax expense and our cash flow in any quarter in which such an event occurs loss of key personnel or the shortage of available skilled worker and the effect of competitive pricing pressure including decrease in average selling price of our product the foregoing factor are often difficult to predict and these well other factor could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating result in addition significant amount of our operating expense are relatively fixed in nature due to our significant sale research and development and internal manufacturing overhead expense any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our result of operation result we believe that quarter to quarter comparison of our revenue and operating result may not be meaningful or reliable indicator of our future performance if our operating result in one or more future quarter fail to meet the expectation of security analyst or investor significant decline in the trading price of our common stock may occur which may happen immediately or over time of contentsfailure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customer demand could adversely affect our result of operation we make significant decision including determining the level of business that we will seek and accept production schedule level of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirement based on our estimate of customer requirement factor that can impact our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirement include the short term nature of many customer commitment our customer ability to reschedule cancel and modify order with little or no notice and without significant penalty the accuracy of our customer forecast and the possibility of rapid change in demand for our customer product well seasonal or cyclical trend in their industry or the semiconductor industry to ensure the availability of our semiconductor product particularly for our largest customer we typically start manufacturing our relevant product based on our customer forecast which are not binding result we incur inventory and manufacturing cost in advance of anticipated sale that may never materialize or that may be substantially lower than expected if actual demand for our product is lower than forecast we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating cost and product obsolescence certain of our sale research and development and internal manufacturing overhead expense are relatively fixed reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income conversely customer often require rapid increase in production on short notice we may be unable to secure sufficient material or contract manufacturing capacity to meet such increase in demand this could damage our customer relationship reduce revenue growth and margin subject to additional liability harm our reputation and prevent from taking advantage of opportunity we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturn the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change and price erosion evolving technical standard frequent new product introduction short product life cycle for semiconductor and for many of the end product in which they are used and wide fluctuation in product supply and demand from time to time these factor together with change in general economic condition cause significant upturn and downturn in the industry in general and in our business in particular period of industry downturn have been characterized by diminished demand for end user product high inventory level and period of inventory adjustment under utilization of manufacturing capacity change in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling price we expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturn even when overall economic condition are relatively stable if we can not offset industry or market downturn our net revenue may decline and our financial condition and result of operation may suffer winning business in the semiconductor solution industry is subject to lengthy process that often requires to incur significant expense from which we may ultimately generate no revenue our semiconductor business is dependent on winning competitive bid selection process known design win these selection process are typically lengthy and can require to dedicate significant development expenditure and scarce engineering resource in pursuit of single customer opportunity failure to obtain particular design win may prevent from obtaining design win in subsequent generation of particular product this can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future competitive bid selection process winning product design doe not guarantee sale to customer or that we will realize much revenue anticipated if any delay or cancellation of customer plan could materially and adversely affect our financial result we incur significant expense in the design process and may generate little or no revenue from it in addition the timing of design win is unpredictable and implementing production for major design win or multiple design win occurring at the same time may strain our resource and those of our contract manufacturer in such event we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resource and incur additional unanticipated cost and expense often customer will only purchase limited number of evaluation unit from until they qualify the product and or the manufacturing line for those product the qualification process can take significant time and resource and we may not always be able to satisfy customer qualification requirement delay in qualification or failure to qualify our product may cause customer to discontinue use of our product and result in significant loss of revenue finally customer could choose at any time to stop using our product or could fail to successfully market and sell their product which could reduce demand for our product and cause to hold excess inventory materially adversely affecting our business financial condition and result of operation these risk are exacerbated by the fact that many of our product and the end product into which our product are incorporated often have very short life cycle competition in our industry could prevent from growing our revenue the industry in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standard change in customer requirement often aggressive pricing practice and in some case new delivery of contentsmethods we expect competition in these industry to continue to increase existing competitor improve or expand their product offering or new competitor enter our market in addition the competitive landscape is changing in these industry result of trend toward consolidation some of our direct competitor have merged with or been acquired by other competitor we expect this consolidation trend to continue which may result in the combined competitor greater manufacturing distribution financial research and development or marketing resource than in addition some of our competitor may also receive financial and other support from their home country government or may have greater presence in key market larger customer base or more comprehensive ip portfolio and patent protection than we compete with integrated device manufacturer and fable semiconductor company well the internal resource of large integrated oems because our product are often building block semiconductor providing function that in some case can be integrated into more complex integrated circuit ic we also face competition from manufacturer of ic well customer that may develop their own ic product our competitor in these market range from large international company offering wide range of semiconductor product and device to smaller company specializing in niche market and new technology our competitor also include large vendor of hardware and operating system software and cloud service provider some of our competitor have longer operating history greater name recognition larger installed base of customer in any particular market larger technical staff more established relationship with hardware vendor or greater financial technical and marketing resource than we also face competition from numerous start ups and smaller company that specialize in specific aspect of the highly fragmented software industry open source author who may provide software and intellectual property for free competitor who may offer their product through try and buy or freemium model and customer who may develop competing product the action of our competitor in the area of pricing and product bundling in particular could have substantial adverse impact on further competitor may leverage their ip or other proprietary information including interface or interoperability information in new and emerging technology and platform that may inhibit our ability to compete effectively if we are unable to compete successfully we may lose market share for our product or incur significant reduction in our gross margin either of which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facility research and development facility or other significant operation or those of our supplier could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation although we operate primarily outsourced manufacturing business model we also rely on our own manufacturing facility in particular in fort collins colorado singapore and breinigsville pennsylvania we use these internal fabrication facility for product utilizing our innovative and proprietary process in order to protect our ip to accelerate time to market of our product and to ensure supply of certain component our fort collins and breinigsville facility are the sole source for the film bulk acoustic resonator component used in many of our wireless device and for the indium phosphide based wafer used in our fibre optic product respectively many of our facility and those of our contract manufacturer and supplier are located in california and the pacific rim region which ha above average seismic activity and severe weather activity in addition our research and development personnel are primarily concentrated in china czech republic india israel malaysia singapore south korea taiwan colorado california and pennsylvania with the expertise of the personnel at each such location tending to be focused on one or two specific area prolonged disruption at one or more of our manufacturing facility for any reason especially our colorado singapore and pennsylvania facility or those of our contract manufacturer or supplier due to natural or man made disaster or other event outside of our control such equipment malfunction or widespread outbreak of acute illness at one or more of these facility would limit our capacity to meet customer demand and delay new product development until replacement facility and equipment if necessary were found any such event would likely disrupt our operation delay production shipment and revenue result in unable to timely satisfy customer demand expose to claim by our customer resulting in significant expense to repair or replace our affected facility and in some instance could significantly curtail our research and development effort in particular product area or target market result we could forgo revenue opportunity potentially lose market share damage our customer relationship and be subject to litigation and additional liability all of which could materially and adversely affect our business although we purchase insurance to mitigate certain loss such insurance often carry high deductible amount and any uninsured loss could negatively affect our operating result in addition even if we were able to promptly resume production of our affected product if our customer can not timely resume their own manufacturing following such an event they may cancel or scale back their order from and this may in turn adversely affect our result of operation such event could also result in increased fixed cost relative to the revenue we generate and adversely affect our result of operation of contentswe may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity at our own manufacturing facility which could adversely affect our relationship with our customer and our business financial condition and result of operation we must maintain appropriate capacity at our own manufacturing facility to meet anticipated customer demand for our proprietary product from time to time this requires to invest in expansion or improvement of those facility which often involves substantial cost and other risk such delay in completion such expanded manufacturing capacity may still be insufficient or may not come online soon enough to meet customer demand and we may have to put customer on product allocation forgo sale or lose customer result conversely if we overestimate customer demand we would experience excess capacity and fixed cost at these facility all of which could adversely affect our result of operation any failure of our it system or one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendor to provide necessary service could have material adverse effect on our business we depend on various it system including network application internal it system and personnel and outsourced service for among other thing financial reporting and product order and shipment we rely on third party vendor to provide critical corporate infrastructure service on timely and effective basis and to adequately address cybersecurity threat to their own system service provided by these third party include certain service related to shipping human resource benefit plan administration it network development and network monitoring while we may be entitled to damage if our vendor fail to perform under their agreement with we may be unable to collect on any award of damage and any award may be insufficient to cover the actual cost we may incur result of vendor failure to perform under it agreement with upon expiration or termination of any of our third party vendor agreement we may not be able to timely replace the vendor on term and condition including service level and cost which are favorable to in addition transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject to operational delay and inefficiency until the transition is complete any failure of these internal or third party system and service to operate effectively could disrupt our operation and could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation by harming our ability to accurately forecast sale demand manage our supply chain and production facility fulfill customer order and report financial and other information on timely and accurate basis our gross margin is dependent on number of factor including our product mix price erosion acquisition we may make level of capacity utilization and commodity price our gross margin is highly dependent on product mix which is susceptible to seasonal and other fluctuation in our market shift in sale mix away from our higher margin product well the timing and amount of our software licensing and non product revenue could adversely affect our future gross margin percentage in addition increased competition and the existence of product alternative more complex engineering requirement lower demand or reduction in our technological lead compared to our competitor and other factor may lead to further price erosion lower revenue and lower margin for in the future our gross margin may also be adversely affected by expense related to the acquisition of business such amortization of intangible asset and restructuring and impairment charge furthermore business or company that we acquire may have different gross margin profile than and could therefore also affect our overall gross margin in addition semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment leading to high fixed cost including depreciation expense if we are unable to utilize our owned manufacturing facility at high level the fixed cost associated with these facility such depreciation expense will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit cost and lower gross margin furthermore fluctuation in commodity price either directly in the price of the raw material we buy or result of price increase passed on to by our supplier could negatively impact our margin we do not hedge our exposure to commodity price some of which including gold and fuel price are very volatile and sudden or prolonged increase in commodity price may adversely affect our gross margin we utilize significant amount of ip in our business if we are unable or fail to protect our ip our business could be adversely affected our success depends in part upon protecting our ip to accomplish this we rely on combination of ip right including patent copyright trademark and trade secret well customary contractual protection with our customer supplier employee and consultant we may be required to spend significant resource to monitor and protect our ip right including unauthorized use of our product the usage rate of the software seat license and subscription that we sell and even with significant expenditure we may not be able to protect the ip right that are valuable to our business we are unable to predict or assure that the ip right that we presently employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated circumvented challenged or in the case of third party ip right licensed to be licensed to others of content our ip right will provide competitive advantage to right previously granted by third party to ip licensed or assigned to including portfolio cross license will not hamper our ability to assert our ip right against potential competitor or hinder the settlement of currently pending or future dispute any of our pending or future patent trademark or copyright application will be issued or have the coverage originally sought our ip right will be enforced in certain jurisdiction where competition may be intense or where legal protection may be weak or we have sufficient ip right to protect our product or our business in addition our competitor or others may develop product or technology that are similar or superior to our product or technology duplicate our product or technology or design around our protected technology effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or more limited in other jurisdiction relative to those protection available in the and may not be applied for or may be abandoned in one or more relevant jurisdiction we may elect to abandon or divest patent or otherwise not pursue prosecution of certain pending patent application due to strategic concern or other factor in addition when patent expire we lose the protection and competitive advantage they provided to we also generate some of our revenue from licensing royalty payment and from technology claim settlement relating to certain of our ip licensing of our ip right particularly exclusive license may limit our ability to assert those ip right against third party including the licensee of those right in addition we may acquire company with ip that is subject to licensing obligation to other third party these licensing obligation may extend to our own ip following any such acquisition and may limit our ability to assert our ip right from time to time we pursue litigation to assert our ip right including in some case against third party with whom we have ongoing relationship such customer and supplier claim of this sort could also harm our relationship with our customer and might deter future customer from doing business with conversely third party may pursue ip litigation against including result of our ip licensing business an adverse decision in such type of legal action could limit our ability to assert our ip right and limit the value of our technology including the loss of opportunity to sell or license our technology to others or to collect royalty payment based upon successful protection and assertion of our ip against others in addition such legal action or adverse decision could otherwise negatively impact our business financial condition and result of operation from time to time we may need to obtain additional ip license or renew existing license agreement we are unable to predict whether these license agreement can be obtained or renewed on acceptable term or at all if our software product do not remain compatible with ever changing operating environment platform or third party product demand for our product and service could decrease which could materially adversely affect our business the largest supplier of system and computing software are in most case the manufacturer of the computer hardware system used by most of our customer particularly in the mainframe space these company periodically modify or introduce new operating system system software and computer hardware which could require substantial modification of our product to maintain compatibility with these company hardware or software additionally we must continually address the challenge of dynamic and accelerating market trend and competitive development such the emergence of advanced persistent threat in the security space to compete effectively customer may require feature and capability that our current solution do not have there can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt our product in response to these development further our software solution interact with variety of software and hardware developed by third party if we lose access to third party code and specification for the development of code this could negatively impact our ability to develop compatible software in addition if software provider and hardware manufacturer including some of our largest vendor adopt new policy restricting the use or availability of their code or technical documentation for their operating system application or hardware or otherwise impose unfavorable term and condition for such access this could result in higher research and development cost for the enhancement and modification of our existing product or development of new product any additional restriction could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result and cash flow failure to enter into software license agreement on satisfactory basis could materially adversely affect our business many of our existing customer have multi year enterprise license agreement some of which involve substantial aggregate fee amount these customer have no contractual obligation to purchase additional solution customer renewal rate may decline or fluctuate result of number of factor including the level of customer satisfaction with our solution or customer support customer budget and the pricing of our solution compared with the solution offered by our of contentscompetitors any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected if at all the failure to renew customer agreement of similar scope on term that are commercially attractive to could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result and cash flow our sale to government client subject to uncertainty regarding fiscal funding approval renegotiations or termination at the discretion of the government well audit and investigation which could result in litigation penalty and sanction including early termination suspension and debarment our multi year contract signed with the federal government and other state and local government agency are generally subject to annual fiscal funding approval and may be renegotiated or terminated at the discretion of the government termination renegotiation or the lack of funding approval for contract could adversely affect our sale revenue and reputation additionally our government contract are generally subject to certain requirement some of which are generally not present in commercial contract and or may be complex well to audit and investigation failure to meet contractual requirement could result in various civil and criminal action and penalty and administrative sanction including termination of contract refund of portion of fee received forfeiture of profit suspension of payment fine and suspension or debarment from doing business with the government and could materially adversely affect our business financial condition operating result and cash flow certain software that we use in our product is licensed from third party and may not be available to in the future which may delay product development and production or cause to incur additional expense some of our solution contain software licensed from third party some of which may not be available to in the future on term that are acceptable to or allow our product to remain competitive the loss of these license or the inability to maintain any of them on commercially acceptable term could delay development of future product or the enhancement of existing product certain software we use is from open source code source which under certain circumstance could materially adversely affect our business financial condition operating result and cash flow some of our product contain software from open source code source the use of which may subject to certain condition including the obligation to offer such product for no cost or to make the proprietary source code of those product publicly available further although some open source vendor provide warranty and support agreement it is common for such software to be available is with no warranty indemnity or support although we monitor our use of such open source code to avoid subjecting our product to unintended condition such use under certain circumstance could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result and cash flow including if we are required to take remedial action that may divert resource away from our development effort we are subject to warranty claim product recall and product liability from time to time we may be subject to warranty or product liability claim that may in the future lead to significant expense our customer contract typically contain warranty and indemnification provision and in certain case may also contain liquidated damage provision relating to product quality issue the potential liability associated with such provision are significant and in some case including in agreement with some of our largest customer are potentially unlimited any such liability may greatly exceed any revenue we receive from the relevant product cost payment or damage incurred or paid by in connection with warranty and product liability claim and product recall could materially adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation we may also be exposed to such claim result of any acquisition we may undertake in the future product liability insurance is subject to significant deductible and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claim or we may elect to self insure with respect to certain matter for example it is possible for one of our customer to recall product containing one of our semiconductor device in such an event we may incur significant cost and expense including among others replacement cost contract damage claim from our customer and reputational harm although we maintain reserve for reasonably estimable liability and purchase product liability insurance our reserve may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claim conversely in some case amount we reserve may ultimately exceed our actual liability for particular claim and may need to be reversed the complexity of our product could result in unforeseen delay or expense or undetected defect or bug which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new product damage our reputation with current or prospective customer and materially and adversely affect our operating cost highly complex product such those we offer may contain defect and bug when they are first introduced or new version software documentation or enhancement are released or their release may be delayed due to unforeseen difficulty during product development if any of our product including the product of company we have acquired or third party component used in our product contain defect or bug or have reliability quality or compatibility problem we of contentsmay not be able to successfully design workarounds furthermore if any of these problem are not discovered until after we have commenced commercial production of or deployed new product we may be required to incur additional development cost and product recall repair or replacement cost significant technical challenge also arise with our software product because our customer license and deploy our product across variety of computer platform and integrate them with number of third party software application and database result if there is system wide failure it may be difficult to determine which product is at fault and we could ultimately be harmed by the failure of another supplier product consequently our reputation may be damaged and customer may be reluctant to buy our product which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customer and attract new customer to resolve these problem we may have to invest significant capital and other resource these problem may also result in claim against by our customer or others for example if delay in the manufacture and delivery of our product cause the delay of customer end product delivery we may be required under the term of our agreement with that customer to compensate the customer for the adverse effect of such delay in addition if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity security or availability occurs in one of our end user customer system regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our product the market perception of the effectiveness of our solution could be harmed these problem may divert our technical and other resource from other development effort and we would likely lose or experience delay in market acceptance of the affected product or product result our financial result could be materially adversely affected we make substantial investment in research and development to enhance existing and develop new technology to keep pace with technological advance and to remain competitive in our business and unsuccessful investment could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation the industry in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change change in customer requirement frequent new product introduction and enhancement short product cycle and evolving industry standard new delivery method and require substantial investment in our research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technology and product in addition semiconductor product transition over time to increasingly smaller line width geometry this requires to adapt our product and manufacturing process to these new technology which requires expertise in new procedure our failure to successfully transition to smaller geometry process technology could impair our competitive position in order to remain competitive we have made and expect to continue to make significant investment in research and development we expect the dollar amount of research and development expense to increase for the foreseeable future due to the increasing complexity and number of product we plan to develop if we fail to develop new and enhanced product and technology if we focus on technology that do not become widely adopted or if new competitive technology that we do not support become widely accepted demand for our product may be reduced significant investment in unsuccessful research and development effort could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation in addition increased investment in research and development could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our product which would have negative impact on our financial result we collect use store or otherwise process personal information which subject to privacy and data security law and contractual commitment and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such law and commitment could harm our business we collect use and store collectively process high volume variety and velocity of certain personal information in connection with the operation of our business particularly in relation to our symantec business the personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal state local and foreign law regarding privacy and data security well contractual commitment any failure or perceived failure by to comply with such obligation may result in governmental enforcement action fine or litigation and could cause our customer to lose trust in which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are expanding rapidly in many jurisdiction and creating complex regulatory compliance environment the cost of complying with and implementing these privacy related and data protection measure could be significant in addition even our inadvertent failure or perceived failure to comply with federal state or international privacy related or data protection law and regulation could result in proceeding against by governmental entity or others and substantial fine and damage the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by to run our business could result in significantly increased business and security cost or cost related to defending legal claim further to ensure that it product are continually enhanced to protect against constantly evolving increasingly sophisticated and wide spread cyber threat nortonlifelock inc relied on threat intelligence gathered from both it consumer business and the symantec business we and nortonlifelock inc have agreed to continue sharing threat intelligence relating to the symantec business and the nortonlifelock inc consumer business respectively following the closing of the transaction failure to continue to receive such threat intelligence could cause the symantec business product to become le effective and adversely affect our business of contentswe are subject to environmental health and safety law which could increase our cost restrict our operation and require expenditure that could have material adverse effect on our result of operation and financial condition we are subject to variety of international law and regulation relating to the use disposal clean of and human exposure to hazardous material compliance with environmental health and safety requirement could among other thing require to modify our manufacturing process restrict our ability to expand our facility or require to acquire pollution control equipment all of which can be very costly any failure by to comply with such requirement could result in the limitation or suspension of the manufacture of our product and could result in litigation against and the payment of significant fine and damage by in the event of significant adverse judgment in addition complying with any cleanup or remediation obligation for which we are or become responsible could be costly and have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation changing requirement relating to the material composition of our semiconductor product including the restriction on lead and certain other substance in electronics that apply to specified electronics product sold in various country including the china japan and in the european union increase the complexity and cost of our product design and procurement operation and may require to re engineer our product such re engineering may result in excess inventory or other additional cost and could have material adverse effect on our result of operation we may also experience claim from employee from time to time with regard to exposure to hazardous material or other workplace related environmental claim social and environmental responsibility regulation policy and provision well customer demand may make our supply chain more complex and may adversely affect our relationship with customer there is an increasing focus on corporate social and environmental responsibility in the semiconductor industry particularly with oems that manufacture consumer electronics number of our customer have adopted or may adopt procurement policy that include social and environmental responsibility provision that their supplier should comply with or they may seek to include such provision in their procurement term and condition an increasing number of participant in the semiconductor industry are also joining voluntary social responsibility initiative such the global compact voluntary initiative for business to develop implement and disclose sustainability policy and practice these social and environmental responsibility provision and initiative are subject to change can be unpredictable and may be difficult and expensive for to comply with given the complexity of our supply chain and our significant outsourced manufacturing if we are unable to comply or are unable to cause our supplier or contract manufacturer to comply with such policy or provision customer may stop purchasing product from and may take legal action against which could harm our reputation revenue and result of operation in addition part of their corporate social and environmental responsibility program an increasing number of oems are seeking to source product that do not contain mineral sourced from area where proceeds from the sale of such mineral are likely to be used to fund armed conflict such in the democratic republic of congo this could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of mineral used in the manufacture of semiconductor device including our product since our supply chain is complex we are not currently able to definitively ascertain the origin of all of the mineral and metal used in our product result we may face difficulty in satisfying these customer demand which may harm our sale and operating result the average selling price of semiconductor product in our market have often decreased rapidly and may do so in the future which could harm our revenue and gross profit the semiconductor product we develop and sell are used for high volume application result the price of those product have often decreased rapidly gross profit on our product may be negatively affected by among other thing pricing pressure from our customer in the past we have reduced the average selling price of our product in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressure new product introduction by or our competitor and other factor in addition some of our customer agreement provide for volume based pricing and product pricing roadmaps which can also reduce the average selling price of our product over time our margin and financial result will suffer if we are unable to offset any reduction in our average selling price by increasing our sale volume reducing manufacturing cost or developing new and higher value added product on timely basis breach of our security system may have material adverse effect on our business our security system are designed to maintain the physical security of our facility and protect our customer supplier and employee confidential information well our own proprietary information however we are also dependent on number of third party cloud based and other service provider of critical corporate infrastructure service relating to among other thing human resource electronic communication service and certain finance function and we are out of necessity dependent on the security system of these provider of contentsaccidental or willful security breach or other unauthorized access by third party or our employee or contractor of our facility our information system or the system of our cloud based or other service provider or the existence of computer virus or malware in our or their data or software could expose to risk of information loss and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information including information relating to our product or customer and the personal information of our employee in addition we have from time to time also been subject to unauthorized network intrusion and malware on our own it network certain of our software product are intended to manage and secure it infrastructure and environment and result we expect these product to be ongoing target of cybersecurity attack open source code or other third party software used in these product could also be targeted additionally we use third party data center including for part of our saas business which may also be subject to hacking incident although we continually seek to improve our countermeasure to prevent such incident we may be unable to anticipate every scenario and it is possible that certain cyber threat or vulnerability will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack on and our customer cybersecurity attack could require significant expenditure of our capital and diversion of our resource additionally effort by malicious cyber actor or others could cause interruption delay or cessation of our product licensing or modification of our software which could cause to lose existing or potential customer successful cybersecurity attack involving our product and it infrastructure could also negatively impact the market perception of their effectiveness any theft or misuse of confidential personally identifiable or proprietary information could disrupt our business and result in among other thing unfavorable publicity damage to our reputation loss of our trade secret and other competitive information difficulty in marketing our product allegation by our customer that we have not performed our contractual obligation litigation by affected party and possible financial obligation for liability and damage related to the theft or misuse of such information well fine and other sanction resulting from any related breach of data privacy regulation such the general data protection regulation any of which could have material adverse effect on our business profitability and financial condition interruption in our operation and service or disruption to the functionality provided by our software including the operation of our global civilian cyber intelligence threat network could adversely impact our revenue or cause customer to cease doing business with in addition our business would be harmed if any of the event of this nature caused our customer and potential customer to believe our service are unreliable our operation are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity event that could have significant disruptive effect on our operation since the technique used to obtain unauthorized access to system or to otherwise sabotage them change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against target we may be unable to anticipate these technique or to implement adequate preventative measure we are required to ass our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any adverse finding from such assessment could result in loss of investor confidence in our financial report significant expense to remediate any internal control deficiency and ultimately have an adverse effect on our stock price we are required to ass the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually required by section of the sarbanes oxley act even though of november we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting wa effective we need to maintain our process and system and adapt them our business grows and change including to reflect our integration of the symantec business well any future acquisition we may undertake this continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal control and complying with section is expensive time consuming and requires significant management attention we can not be certain that our internal control measure will continue to provide adequate control over our financial process and reporting and ensure compliance with section furthermore we grow our business or acquire other business our internal control may become more complex and we may require significantly more resource to ensure they remain effective failure to implement required new or improved control or difficulty encountered in the implementation of such control either in our existing business or in business that we acquire could harm our operating result or cause to fail to meet our reporting obligation if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weakness in our internal control the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remedied may cause investor to lose confidence in our financial statement and the trading price of our common stock may decline remediation of material weakness could require to incur significant expense and if we fail to remedy any material weakness our financial statement may be inaccurate we may be required to restate our financial statement our ability to report our financial result on timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected our access to the capital market may be restricted the trading price of our common stock may decline and we may be subject to sanction or investigation by regulatory authority including the sec or the nasdaq global select market of contentscurrent and future accounting pronouncement and other financial reporting standard especially concerning revenue recognition may negatively impact our financial result our reported financial result are impacted by the accounting standard promulgated by the sec and national accounting standard body and the method estimate and judgment that we use in applying those standard in our accounting policy new standard change to existing standard and change in their interpretation have required and in the future may require to change our accounting policy and procedure or implement new or enhance existing system for example asu revenue from contract with customer topic became effective for starting with fiscal year in connection with the ca merger and our change to ca business strategy including our adoption of policy that allows customer to terminate their ca software contract for convenience we have been required to establish revenue recognition accounting policy and procedure under topic that we believe are appropriate for the business we intend to conduct it while we believe our policy and procedure are reasonable and appropriate they are based on method estimate and judgment that are subject to risk uncertainty assumption and change that could adversely affect our reported financial position and financial result fluctuation in foreign exchange rate could result in loss we operate global business and our consolidated financial result are reported in dollar however some of the revenue and expense of our foreign subsidiary are denominated in local currency fluctuation in foreign exchange rate against the dollar could result in substantial change in reported revenue and operating result due to the foreign exchange impact of translating these transaction into dollar in the normal course of business we employ various hedging strategy to partially mitigate these risk including the use of derivative instrument these strategy may not be effective in protecting against the effect of fluctuation in foreign exchange rate result fluctuation in foreign exchange rate could result in financial loss the enactment of legislation implementing change in taxation of international business activity the adoption of other corporate tax reform policy or change in tax legislation or policy could materially impact our financial position and result of operation corporate tax reform base erosion effort and tax transparency continue to be high priority in many tax jurisdiction where we have business operation result policy regarding corporate income and other tax in numerous jurisdiction are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation is being proposed or enacted in number of jurisdiction for example the tax cut and job act the tax reform act adopted broad corporate income tax reform which among other thing reduced the corporate income tax rate but imposed base erosion prevention measure on earnings of non subsidiary of entity well the transition tax on mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated non earnings of controlled foreign corporation in addition many country are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rule with the organisation for economic co operation and development base erosion and profit shifting recommendation and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy including change to cross border tax transfer pricing documentation rule and nexus based tax incentive practice result of the heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policy prior decision by tax authority regarding treatment and position of corporate income tax could be subject to enforcement activity and legislative investigation and inquiry which could also result in change in tax policy or prior tax ruling any such change in policy or ruling may also result in the tax we previously paid being subject to change any substantial change in domestic or international corporate tax policy regulation or guidance enforcement activity or legislative initiative may materially adversely affect our business the amount of tax we are required to pay and our financial condition and result of operation generally if the tax incentive or tax holiday arrangement we have negotiated in singapore and other jurisdiction change or cease to be in effect or applicable in part or in whole for any reason or if our assumption and interpretation regarding tax law and incentive or holiday arrangement prove to be incorrect the amount of corporate income tax we have to pay could significantly increase our operation are currently structured to benefit from the various tax incentive and tax holiday extended to in various jurisdiction to encourage investment or employment for example our principal tax incentive from the singapore economic development board an agency of the government of singapore provides that any qualifying income we earn in singapore is subject to tax incentive or reduced rate of singapore income tax absent these tax incentive the corporate income tax rate that would otherwise apply to our singapore taxable income would be these singapore tax incentive are expected to expire in november subject to potential extension which we may or may not be able to obtain and any subsequent change in incentive scope or legislative development we also have tax holiday on our qualifying income in malaysia which is scheduled to expire in fiscal year the tax incentive and tax holiday that we have obtained are also of contentssubject to our compliance with various operating and other condition and may in some instance be amended or terminated prior to their scheduled termination date by the relevant governmental authority if we can not or elect not to comply with the operating condition included in any particular tax incentive or tax holiday we could in some instance be required to refund previously realized material tax benefit or if such tax incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to it expiration absent new incentive applying we will lose the related tax benefit earlier than scheduled depending on the incentive at issue we could also be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy in order to keep the incentive which may not be beneficial to the present structure or tax strategy our tax incentive and tax holiday taking into consideration the effect of the tax reform act and other indirect tax provision increased the benefit from income tax by approximately million in the aggregate and increased diluted net income per share by for fiscal year our interpretation and conclusion regarding the tax incentive are not binding on any taxing authority and if our assumption about tax and other law are incorrect or if these tax incentive are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequence which would increase our expense reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flow our provision for income tax and overall cash tax cost are affected by number of factor including reorganization or restructurings of our business or asset jurisdictional revenue mix and change in tax regulation or policy and may be further impacted by corporate transaction all of which could materially adversely affect financial result we are multinational company subject to tax in various tax jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax in the ordinary course of our business there are many transaction where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain additionally our calculation of income tax payable currently and on deferred basis are based on our interpretation of applicable tax law in the jurisdiction in which we are required to file tax return our provision for income tax is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by numerous factor including reorganization or restructuring of our business tangible and intangible asset outstanding indebtedness and corporate structure such in connection with acquiring business jurisdictional mix of our income and asset and the resulting tax effect of differing tax rate in different country change in the allocation of income and expense including adjustment related to change in our corporate structure acquisition or tax law change in transfer pricing rule or method of applying these rule change in tax law including in the change to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiary the deductibility of expense attributable to income and foreign tax credit rule tax effect of increase in non deductible employee compensation change in tax accounting rule or principle and in the valuation of deferred tax asset and liability outcome of income tax audit and modification expiration lapse or termination of tax credit or incentive we have adopted transfer pricing policy between our affiliated entity our policy call for the provision of service the sale of product the advance of financing and grant of license from one affiliate to another at price that we believe are negotiated on an arm length basis our taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practice and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authority being on an arm length basis due to inconsistency in application of the arm length standard among taxing authority well lack of comprehensive treaty based protection transfer pricing challenge by tax authority could if successful result in adjustment for prior or future year result of these adjustment we could become subject to higher tax and our earnings and result of operation would be adversely affected in any period in which such determination is made although we believe our tax estimate are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different than what is reflected in our income tax provision and accrual significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement of tax liability prescribed in the relevant accounting guidance for uncertainty in income tax the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income tax applies to all income tax position which if resolved unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income tax and our payment obligation with respect to any such tax in addition we are subject to and are under tax audit in various jurisdiction and such jurisdiction may ass additional income tax against although we believe our tax position are reasonable the final determination of tax audit could be materially different from our income tax provision and accrual the ultimate result of an audit could have material adverse effect on our result of operation and cash flow in the period or period for which that determination is made of contentsthe internal revenue service may not agree that prior to the redomiciliation transaction broadcom singapore should have been treated foreign corporation for federal income tax purpose although broadcom singapore is singapore entity the internal revenue service irs may assert that following our acquisition of brcm broadcom singapore should have been treated corporation for federal income tax purpose pursuant to section of the internal revenue code of amended the code if the irs were to determine that under section of the code the former shareholder of brcm held at least of the vote or value of the ordinary share of broadcom singapore immediately after our acquisition of brcm such percentage referred to the section percentage broadcom singapore would be treated surrogate foreign corporation and several limitation could then apply to brcm for example brcm would be prohibited from using it net operating loss foreign tax credit or other tax attribute to offset the income or gain recognized by reason of the transfer of property to foreign related person during the year period following our acquisition of brcm or any income received or accrued during such period by reason of license of any property by brcm to foreign related person moreover in such case section of the code and rule related thereto would impose an excise tax on the value of certain stock compensation held directly or indirectly by certain brcm disqualified individual including former officer and director of brcm at rate equal to but only if gain is otherwise recognized by brcm former shareholder result of our acquisition of brcm if the irs were to determine the section percentage wa or more then broadcom singapore would be treated corporation for federal income tax purpose while we believe the section percentage wa significantly le than determining the section percentage is complex and is subject to factual and legal uncertainty there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with our position risk relating to our indebtednessour substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operation or potential acquisition could limit our ability to react to change in the economy or our industry and expose to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate indebtedness and prevent from fulfilling our obligation under our indebtedness of november our indebtedness under the senior note the senior note and the assumed ca senior note wa million million and million respectively in addition million wa outstanding under the term loan we also borrowed billion of term loan to fund the acquisition of the symantec business we expect to maintain significant level of indebtedness going forward our substantial indebtedness could have important consequence including increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry condition exposing to interest rate risk due to our variable rate term facility which we do not typically hedge against limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to change in the economy and the semiconductor industry placing at competitive disadvantage compared to our competitor with le indebtedness making it more difficult to borrow additional fund in the future to fund growth acquisition working capital capital expenditure and other purpose and potentially requiring to dedicate substantial portion of our cash flow from operation to payment on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund our other business need in addition our variable rate indebtedness may use libor benchmark for establishing the rate libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposal for reform these reform and other pressure may cause libor to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past the consequence of these development can not be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness we receive debt rating from the major credit

cloud platform our three reportable segment in fiscal year were semiconductor solution infrastructure software and ip licensing our overall net revenue well the percentage of total net revenue generated by sale in our semiconductor solution and infrastructure software segment ha varied from quarter to quarter due largely to fluctuation in end market demand including the effect of seasonality which are discussed in detail in part item business under seasonality of this annual report on form original equipment manufacturer oems or their contract manufacturer and distributor typically account for the substantial majority of our semiconductor sale to serve customer around the world we have strategically developed relationship with large global electronic component distributor complemented by number of regional distributor with customer relationship based on their respective product range we also sell our product to wide variety of oems or their contract manufacturer we have established strong relationship with leading oem customer across multiple target market our direct sale force focus on supporting our large oem customer and ha specialized product

customer business and ha enabled to be more efficient and productive and to better serve our target market and customer we recognize revenue upon delivery of product to the distributor which can cause our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly such revenue is reduced for estimated return and distributor allowance our traditional software customer generally consist of large enterprise that have computing environment from multiple vendor and are highly complex we believe our enterprise wide license model will continue to offer our customer reduced complexity more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth cost and expensescost of product sold cost of product sold consists primarily of the cost for semiconductor wafer and other material well the cost of assembling and testing those product and material such cost include personnel and overhead related to our manufacturing operation which include stock based compensation expense related occupancy computer service equipment cost manufacturing quality order fulfillment warranty adjustment inventory adjustment including write down for inventory obsolescence and acquisition cost which include direct transaction cost and integration related cost although we outsource significant portion of our manufacturing activity we do have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facility if we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facility at desired level the fixed cost associated with these facility will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit cost and lower gross margin cost of subscription and service cost of subscription and service consists of personnel project cost associated with professional service or support of our subscription and service revenue and allocated facility cost and other corporate expense personnel cost include stock based compensation expense total cost of revenue also includes the purchase accounting effect on inventory amortization

deferring such income tax payment until the foreign earnings are repatriated into the and the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated non earnings of controlled foreign corporation the transition tax following the enactment of the tax reform act the security and exchange commission sec issued guidance for situation when there is insufficient information to complete the accounting for certain income tax effect of the tax reform act based on our interpretation of the tax reform act and the sec guidance we recognized an income tax benefit of million during fiscal year during fiscal year we recorded an income tax provision of million from change in estimate of our fiscal year benefit result of proposed treasury regulation issued in fiscal year related to the tax reform act we also recognized an income tax benefit of million in fiscal year primarily result of our redomiciliation to the united state in april the redomiciliation transaction we have structured our operation to maximize the benefit from tax incentive extended to in various jurisdiction to encourage investment or employment our tax incentive from the singapore economic development board an agency of the government of singapore provide that any qualifying income earned in singapore is subject to tax incentive or reduced rate of singapore income tax subject to our compliance with the condition specified in these incentive and legislative development these singapore tax incentive are presently expected to expire in november subject in certain case to potential extension which we may or may not be able to obtain absent these tax incentive the corporate income tax rate in singapore that would otherwise apply to would be we also have tax holiday on our qualifying income in malaysia which is scheduled to expire in fiscal year the tax incentive and tax holiday that we have obtained are also subject to our compliance with various operating and other condition if we can not or elect not to comply with the operating condition included in any particular tax incentive we will lose the related tax benefit and we could be required to refund previously realized material tax benefit depending on the incentive at issue we could also be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy which may not be beneficial to the benefit provided under the present tax concession arrangement before taking into consideration the effect of the tax reform act and other indirect tax impact the effect of these tax incentive and tax holiday wa to increase the benefit from income tax by approximately million and million for fiscal year and respectively for fiscal year the effect of these tax incentive and tax holiday wa to reduce the overall provision for income tax by approximately million our interpretation and conclusion regarding the tax incentive are not binding on any taxing authority and if our assumption about tax and other law are incorrect or if these tax incentive are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequence which would increase our expense reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flow in addition taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practice and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authority being on an arm length basis due to inconsistency in application of the arm length standard among taxing authority well lack of adequate treaty based protection transfer pricing challenge by tax authority could if successful substantially increase our income tax expense critical accounting estimatesthe preparation of financial statement in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle in the united state gaap requires to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability and disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period we base our estimate and assumption on current fact historical experience and various other factor that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability and the accrual of cost and expense that are not readily apparent from other source our actual financial result may differ materially and adversely from our estimate our critical accounting policy are those that affect our historical financial statement materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgment by management those policy include revenue recognition business combination valuation of long lived asset intangible asset and goodwill inventory valuation income tax retirement and post retirement benefit plan assumption stock based compensation and employee bonus program see note summary of significant accounting policy included in part ii item of this annual report on form for further information on our critical accounting policy and estimate revenue recognition we account for contract with customer when both party have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligation each party right can be identified payment term can be identified the contract ha commercial substance and it is probable we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to revenue is recognized when or performance obligation are satisfied by transferring control of promised product or service to customer our product and service can be broadly categorized sale of product and subscription and service of contentswe recognize product revenue from sale to direct customer and distributor when control transfer to the customer an allowance for distributor credit covering price adjustment is made based on our estimate of historical experience rate well considering economic condition and contractual term to date actual distributor claim activity ha been materially consistent with the provision we have made based on our historical estimate however because of the inherent nature of estimate there is always risk that there could be significant difference between actual amount and our estimate different judgment or estimate could result in variance that might be significant to reported operating result we also record reduction of revenue for rebate in the same period that the related revenue is recorded we accrue of potential rebate at the time of sale we reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amount specific rebate program contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebate are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid thus the reversal of unclaimed rebate may have positive impact on our net revenue and net income in subsequent period our contract may contain more than one of our product and service each of which is separately accounted for distinct performance obligation when available we use directly observable transaction to determine the standalone selling price for performance obligation our estimate of standalone selling price for each performance obligation require judgment that considers multiple factor including but not limited to historical discounting trend for product and service and pricing practice through different sale channel gross margin objective internal cost competitor pricing strategy technology lifecycles and market condition we also estimate the standalone selling price of our material right our estimate of the value of the customer option to purchase or receive additional product or service at discounted price includes estimating the incremental discount the customer would obtain when exercising the option and the likelihood that the option would be exercised certain contract contain right of return that allows the customer to cancel all or portion of the product or service and receive credit we estimate return based on historical return data which is constrained to an amount for which material revenue reversal is not probable we do not recognize revenue for product or service that are expected to be returned business combination accounting for business combination requires management to make significant estimate and assumption especially at the acquisition date for intangible asset contractual obligation assumed restructuring liability pre acquisition contingency and contingent consideration where applicable although we believe the assumption and estimate we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain critical estimate in valuing certain of the intangible asset we have acquired include but are not limited to future expected cash flow from product sale customer contract and acquired technology expected cost to develop ipr into commercially viable product estimated cash flow from the project when completed and discount rate the discount rate used to discount expected future cash flow to present value are typically derived from weighted average cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risk unanticipated event and circumstance may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumption estimate or actual result valuation of goodwill and long lived asset we perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year and more frequently if we believe indicator of impairment exist the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment to review for impairment we first ass qualitative factor to determine whether event or circumstance lead to determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting unit is le than it carrying amount our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill whether performed annually or based on specific event or circumstance considers various macroeconomic industry specific and company specific factor these factor include severe adverse industry or economic trend ii significant company specific action including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operation iii current historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance or iv sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value after assessing the totality of event and circumstance if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting unit is le than it carrying amount no further assessment is performed if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting unit is le than it carrying amount we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit net book value determining the fair value of reporting unit involves the use of significant estimate and assumption our goodwill impairment test us both the income approach and the market approach to estimate reporting unit fair value the income approach is based on the discounted cash flow method that us the reporting unit estimate for forecasted future financial performance including revenue operating expense and tax well working capital and capital asset requirement these estimate are developed part of our long term planning process based on assumed market segment growth rate and our assumed market segment share estimated cost based on historical data and various internal estimate projected cash flow are then discounted to present value employing discount rate that properly account for the estimated market of contentsweighted average cost of capital well any risk unique to the subject cash flow the market approach is based on weighting financial multiple of comparable company and applies control premium reporting unit carrying value represents the assignment of various asset and liability excluding certain corporate asset and liability such cash and debt we ass the impairment of long lived asset including purchased ipr property plant and equipment and intangible asset whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable factor we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating result ii significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business or iii significant negative industry or economic trend the process of evaluating the potential impairment of long lived asset under the accounting guidance on property plant and equipment and other intangible asset is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment in order to estimate the fair value of long lived asset we typically make various assumption about the future prospect of our business or the part of our business that the long lived asset relates to we also consider market factor specific to the business and estimate future cash flow to be generated by the business which requires significant judgment it is based on assumption about market demand for our product over number of future year based on these assumption and estimate we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the long lived asset stated on our consolidated balance sheet to reflect it estimated fair value assumption and estimate about future value and remaining useful life are complex and often subjective they can be affected by variety of factor including external factor such the real estate market industry and economic trend and internal factor such change in our business strategy and our internal forecast although we believe the assumption and estimate we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate change in assumption and estimate could materially impact our reported financial result inventory valuation we regularly review inventory quantity on hand and record provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirement demand for our product can fluctuate significantly from period to period significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantity on hand in addition our industry is characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantity on hand additionally our estimate of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate which may cause to understate or overstate both the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory and cost of product sold therefore although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecast of future product demand any significant unanticipated change in demand or technological development could have significant impact on the value of our inventory and our result of operation income tax significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income tax including the determination of deferred tax asset and liability and any valuation allowance that might be required against the deferred tax asset we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategy in assessing the need for valuation allowance if we determine that valuation allowance is required such adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase our tax expense in the period in which such determination is made conversely if we determine that valuation allowance exceeds our requirement such adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease tax expense in the period in which such determination is made in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing position we accrue an income tax liability when such position do not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition the calculation of our tax liability involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax law and regulation in multitude of jurisdiction we recognize potential liability for anticipated tax audit issue in the and other tax jurisdiction based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax interest and penalty will be due if our estimate of income tax liability prof to be le than the actual amount ultimately assessed further charge to tax expense would be required if the payment of these amount ultimately prof to be unnecessary the reversal of the accrued liability would result in tax benefit being recognized in the period when we determine the liability no longer exist retirement and post retirement benefit plan assumption retirement and post retirement benefit plan cost represent obligation that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future retirement and post retirement benefit plan cost over the employee average expected future service to based on the term of the plan and investment and funding decision to estimate the impact of these future payment and our decision concerning funding of these obligation we are required to make assumption using actuarial concept within the framework of gaap one assumption is the discount rate used to calculate the estimated cost other assumption include the expected long term return on plan asset expected future salary increase the health care cost trend rate expected future increase to benefit payment expected retirement date employee turnover retiree mortality rate and portfolio composition we evaluate these assumption at least annually of contentsthe discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payment at the relevant measurement date november and november for both and non plan in fiscal year and respectively the discount rate are based on the result of matching expected plan benefit payment with cash flow from hypothetical yield curve constructed with high quality corporate bond yield the discount rate for non plan wa based either on published rate for government bond or use of hypothetical yield curve constructed with high quality corporate bond yield depending on the availability of sufficient quantity of quality corporate bond lower discount rate increase present value of the pension liability and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rate decrease present value of the pension liability and subsequent year pension expense the expected rate of return on plan asset is set equal to the discount rate due to the implementation of our fully matched liability driven investment strategy actuarial assumption are based on our best estimate and judgment material change may occur in retirement benefit cost in the future if these assumption differ from actual event or experience we performed sensitivity analysis on the discount rate which is the key assumption in calculating pension and post retirement benefit obligation of november each change of basis point in the discount rate assumption would have had an estimated million impact on the benefit obligation of november each change of basis point in the discount rate assumption or expected rate of return assumption would not have material impact on annual net retirement benefit cost for fiscal year stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense consists of expense for rsus and stock option granted to employee and non employee or assumed from acquisition well expense associated with broadcom employee stock purchase plan espp we recognize compensation expense for time based stock option and espp right based on the estimated grant date fair value method required under the authoritative guidance using the black scholes valuation model certain equity award include both time based and market based condition and are accounted for market based award the fair value of these market based award is estimated on the date of grant using monte carlo simulation model employee bonus program our employee bonus program which are overseen by our compensation committee or our board in the case of our chief executive officer provide for variable compensation based on the attainment of overall corporate annual target and functional performance metric in the first fiscal quarter of the year if management determines that it is probable that the target and metric will be achieved and the amount can be reasonably estimated variable proportional compensation accrual is recognized based on an assumed achievement of the target and metric the bonus payout level can be greater if attainment of metric and target is greater than and portion of the payouts may not occur if minimum floor of performance is not achieved in subsequent quarter we monitor and accrue for variable compensation expense based on our actual progress toward the achievement of the annual target and metric the actual achievement of target metric at the end of the fiscal year which is subject to approval by our compensation committee may result in the actual variable compensation amount being significantly higher or lower than the relevant estimated amount accrued in earlier quarter which would result in corresponding adjustment in the fourth fiscal quarter fiscal year presentationwe operate on or week fiscal year ending on the sunday closest to october

statement include the account of broadcom and it subsidiary and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted principle in the united state gaap all intercompany balance and transaction have been eliminated in consolidation summary of significant accounting policy foreign currency remeasurement we operate in dollar functional currency environment such foreign currency asset and liability are remeasured into dollar at current exchange rate except for non monetary item such inventory and property plant and equipment which are remeasured at historical exchange rate the effect of foreign currency remeasurement were not material for any period presented of contentsuse of estimate the preparation of financial statement in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability and disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period actual result could differ from those estimate and such difference could affect the result of operation reported in future period cash and cash equivalent we consider all highly liquid investment security with original or remaining maturity of three month or le at the date of purchase to be cash equivalent we determine the appropriate classification of our cash and cash equivalent at the time of purchase trade account receivable net trade account receivable are recognized at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest account receivable are reduced by an allowance for doubtful account which is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit loss in our existing account receivable we determine the allowance based on customer specific experience and the aging of such receivables among other factor allowance for doubtful account were not material of november or november account receivable are also recognized net of sale return and distributor credit allowance these amount are recognized when it is both probable and estimable that discount will be granted or product will be returned allowance for sale return and distributor credit allowance at november and november were million and million respectively concentration of credit risk and significant customer our cash cash equivalent and account receivable are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk cash and cash equivalent may be redeemable upon demand and are maintained with several financial institution that management belief are of high credit quality and therefore bear minimal credit risk we seek to mitigate our credit risk by spreading such risk across multiple counterparties and monitoring the risk profile of these counterparties our account receivable are derived from revenue earned from customer located both within and outside the we mitigate collection risk from our customer by performing regular credit evaluation of our customer financial condition and require collateral such letter of credit and bank guarantee in certain circumstance concentration of other risk we operate in market that are highly competitive and rapidly changing significant technological change shifting customer need the emergence of competitive product with new capability general economic condition worldwide the ability to safeguard patent and other intellectual property in rapidly evolving market and reliance on assembly and test subcontractor third party wafer fabricator and independent distributor and other factor could affect our financial result inventory we value our inventory at the lower of actual cost or net realizable value of the inventory with cost being determined under the first in first out method we record provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirement the excess and obsolete balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess and obsolete inventory charge and the written down value of the inventory becomes it new cost basis retirement benefit post retirement benefit plan asset and liability are estimate of benefit that we expect to pay to eligible retiree we consider various factor in determining the value of our post retirement plan asset and liability including the number of employee that we expect to receive benefit and other actuarial assumption for defined benefit pension plan we consider various factor in determining our respective pension liability and net periodic benefit cost including the number of employee that we expect to receive benefit their salary level and year of service the expected return on plan asset the discount rate the timing of the payment of benefit and other actuarial assumption if the actual result and event of the retirement benefit plan differ from our current assumption the benefit obligation may be over or under valued the key benefit plan assumption are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan asset the discount rate are based on the result of matching expected plan benefit payment with cash flow from hypothetical yield curve constructed with high quality corporate bond yield the expected rate of return on plan asset is set equal to the discount rate due to the implementation of our fully matched liability driven investment strategy for the non plan we set assumption specific to each country we have elected to measure post retirement benefit plan and defined benefit pension plan asset and liability of october which is the month end that is closest to our fiscal year end of contentsderivative instrument we are subject to foreign currency risk for transaction denominated in foreign currency primarily the singapore dollar israeli shekel euro japanese yen and indian rupee therefore we enter into foreign exchange forward contract to manage financial exposure resulting from the change in the exchange rate of these foreign currency these contract are designated at inception hedge of the related foreign currency exposure which include committed and forecasted revenue and expense transaction that are denominated in currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary which ha the exposure we exclude time value from the measurement of effectiveness to achieve hedge accounting contract must reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk otherwise inherent in the amount and duration of the hedged exposure and comply with established risk management policy our hedging contract generally mature within three month we do not use derivative financial instrument for speculative or trading purpose we designate our forward contract either cash flow or fair value hedge all derivative are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair value based on level input defined in the fair value hierarchy the accounting for gain and loss resulting from change in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting for derivative instrument that are designated and qualify fair value hedge change in value of the instrument are recognized in net income in the current period such hedge are recognized in net income and are offset by the change in fair value of the underlying asset or liability being hedged for derivative instrument that are designated and qualify cash flow hedge change in the value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss component of stockholder equity these amount are then reclassified and recognized in net income when either the forecasted transaction affect earnings or it becomes probable the forecasted transaction will not occur change in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instrument are recognized in net income in the current period which have not been material to date change in the value of derivative instrument not designated hedge are recognized in other income net in our consolidated statement of operation we did not have any outstanding foreign exchange forward contract of november or november property plant and equipment property plant and equipment are stated at cost le accumulated depreciation and amortization addition improvement and major renewal are capitalized and maintenance repair and minor renewal are expensed incurred asset are held in construction in progress until placed in service upon which date we begin to depreciate these asset when asset are retired or disposed of the asset and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from our property plant and equipment balance and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operation building and leasehold improvement are generally depreciated over to year or over the lease period whichever is shorter and machinery and equipment are generally depreciated over three to ten year we use the straight line method of depreciation for all property plant and equipment fair value measurement fair value is defined the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date three level hierarchy is applied to prioritize the input to valuation technique used to measure fair value the hierarchy give the highest priority to unadjusted quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable input level measurement the three level of the fair value hierarchy under the guidance for fair value measurement are described below level level input are quoted price unadjusted in active market for identical asset or liability that the reporting entity ha the ability to access at the measurement date our level asset include cash equivalent banker acceptance trading security investment and investment fund we measure trading security investment and investment fund at quoted market price they are traded in an active market with sufficient volume and frequency of transaction level level input are input other than quoted price included within level that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly if the asset or liability ha specified contractual term level input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability level level input are unobservable input for the asset or liability in which there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date level asset and liability include cost method investment goodwill intangible asset and property plant and equipment which are measured at fair value using discounted cash flow approach when they are impaired quantitative information for level asset and liability reviewed at each reporting period includes indicator of significant deterioration in the earnings performance credit rating asset quality business prospect of the investee and financial indicator of the investee ability to continue going concern of contentsbusiness combination we account for business combination under the acquisition method of accounting which requires to recognize separately from goodwill the asset acquired and the liability assumed at their acquisition date fair value while we use our best estimate and assumption to accurately value asset acquired and liability assumed at the acquisition date well contingent consideration where applicable our estimate are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustment to the asset acquired and liability assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the value of asset acquired or liability assumed whichever come first any subsequent adjustment are recognized in our consolidated statement of operation accounting for business combination requires our management to make significant estimate and assumption especially at the acquisition date including our estimate for intangible asset contractual obligation assumed restructuring liability pre acquisition contingency and contingent consideration where applicable although we believe the assumption and estimate we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain critical estimate in valuing certain acquired intangible asset under the income approach include growth in future expected cash flow from product sale customer contract and acquired technology revenue growth rate customer ramp up period technology obsolescence rate expected cost to develop in process research and development ipr into commercially viable product estimated cash flow from the project when completed and discount rate unanticipated event and circumstance may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumption estimate or actual result goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related cost over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible asset of business acquired goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicator arise for impairment to review for impairment we first ass qualitative factor to determine whether event or circumstance lead to determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting unit is le than it carrying amount our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill whether performed annually or based on specific event or circumstance considers various macroeconomic industry specific and company specific factor those factor include severe adverse industry or economic trend ii significant company specific action including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operation iii current historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance or iv sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value after assessing the totality of event and circumstance if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting unit is le than it carrying amount no further assessment is performed if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting unit is le than it carrying amount we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit net book value if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than it net book value there is no impairment otherwise we calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible asset excluding goodwill of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is le than the carrying value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference determining the fair value of reporting unit involves the use of significant estimate and assumption long lived asset purchased finite lived intangible asset are carried at cost le accumulated amortization amortization is recognized over the period during which the intangible asset are expected to contribute to our cash flow purchased ipr project are capitalized at fair value an indefinite lived intangible asset and assessed for impairment thereafter upon completion of each underlying project ipr asset are reclassified amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized over their estimated useful life if an ipr project is abandoned we recognize the carrying value of the related intangible asset in our consolidated statement of operation in the period it is abandoned on quarterly basis we monitor factor and change in circumstance that could indicate carrying amount of long lived asset including purchased intangible asset and property plant and equipment may not be recoverable factor we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating result ii significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business and iii significant negative industry or economic trend an impairment loss must be measured if the sum of the expected future cash flow undiscounted and before interest from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group is le than the net book value of the asset or asset group the amount of the impairment loss will generally be measured the difference between the net book value of the asset or asset group and the estimated fair value warranty we accrue for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time revenue is recognized product warranty cost are estimated based upon our historical experience and specific identification of the product requirement which may fluctuate based on product mix additionally we accrue for warranty cost associated with occasional or unanticipated product quality issue if loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated of contentsrevenue recognition we account for contract with customer when both party have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligation each party right can be identified payment term can be identified the contract ha commercial substance and it is probable we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to revenue is recognized when or performance obligation are satisfied by transferring control of promised product or service to customer nature of product and servicesour product and service can be broadly categorized sale of product and subscription and service the following is description of the principal activity from which we generate revenue product we recognize revenue from sale to direct customer and distributor when control transfer to the customer rebate and incentive offered to distributor which are earned when sale to end customer are completed are estimated at the point of revenue recognition we have elected to exclude from the transaction price any tax collected from customer and to account for shipping and handling activity performed after customer obtains control of the product activity to fulfill the promise to transfer the product subscription and service our subscription and service revenue consists of sale and royalty from software arrangement support service professional service transfer of ip and non recurring engineering nre arrangement revenue from software arrangement primarily consists of fee which may be paid either at contract inception or in installment over the contract term that provide customer with right to use the software access general support and maintenance and utilize our professional service our software license have standalone functionality from which customer derive benefit and the customer obtains control of the software when it is delivered or made available for download we believe that for the majority of software arrangement customer derive significant benefit from the ongoing support we provide our ca related subscription and service arrangement permit our customer to unilaterally terminate or cancel these arrangement at any time at the customer convenience referred to termination for convenience provision without substantive termination penalty and receive pro rata refund of any prepaid fee accordingly we account for arrangement with these termination for convenience provision series of daily contract resulting in ratable revenue recognition of software revenue over the contractual period support service consist primarily of telephone support and the provision of unspecified update and upgrade on when and if available basis support service represent stand ready obligation for which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement professional service consist of implementation consulting customer education and customer training service the obligation to provide professional service is generally satisfied over time with the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefit we satisfy our performance obligation right to our ip are either sold or licensed to customer ip revenue recognition is dependent on the nature and term of each agreement we recognize ip revenue upon delivery of the ip if there are no substantive future obligation to perform under the arrangement sale based or usage based royalty from the license of ip are recognized at the later of the period the sale or usage occur or the satisfaction of the performance obligation to which some or all of the sale based or usage based royalty have been allocated there are two main category of nre contract which we enter into with our customer nre contract in which we develop custom chip and nre contract in which we accelerate our development of new chip upon the customer request the majority of our nre contract revenue meet the over time criterion such revenue is recognized over the development period with the measure of progress using the input method based on cost incurred to total cost cost to cost the service are provided for nre contract that do not meet the over time criterion revenue is recognized at point in time when the nre service are complete material right contract with customer may also include material right that are also performance obligation these include the right to renew or receive product or service at discounted price in the future revenue allocated to material right is recognized when the customer exercise the right or the right expires arrangement with multiple performance obligationsour contract may contain more than one of the product and service listed above each of which is separately accounted for distinct performance obligation allocation of consideration we allocate total contract consideration to each distinct performance obligation in bundled arrangement on relative standalone selling price basis the standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstance and to similar customer of contentsstandalone selling price when available we use directly observable transaction to determine the standalone selling price for performance obligation our estimate of standalone selling price for each performance obligation require judgment that considers multiple factor including but not limited to historical discounting trend for product and service and pricing practice through different sale channel gross margin objective internal cost competitor pricing strategy technology lifecycles and market condition we separately determine the standalone selling price by product or service type additionally we segment the standalone selling price for product where the pricing strategy differ and where there are difference in customer and circumstance that warrant segmentation we also estimate the standalone selling price of our material right lastly we estimate the value of the customer option to purchase or receive additional product or service at discounted price by estimating the incremental discount the customer would obtain when exercising the option and the likelihood that the option would be exercised other policy and judgmentscontract modification we may modify contract to offer customer additional product or service each of the additional product and service are generally considered distinct from those product or service transferred to the customer before the modification we evaluate whether the contract price for the additional product and service reflects the standalone selling price adjusted for fact and circumstance applicable to that contract in these case we account for the additional product or service separate contract in other case where the pricing in the modification doe not reflect the standalone selling price adjusted for fact and circumstance applicable to that contract we account for the additional product or service part of the existing contract on prospective basis on cumulative catch up basis or on combination of both based on the nature of modification in instance where the pricing in the modification offer the customer credit for prior arrangement we adjust our variable consideration reserve for return and other concession right of return certain contract contain right of return that allows the customer to cancel all or portion of the product or service and receive credit we estimate return based on historical return data which is constrained to an amount for which material revenue reversal is not probable we do not recognize revenue for product or service that are expected to be returned transition practical expedient elected we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligation for contract with an original expected length of one year or le and ii contract for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for service performed for contract that were modified before the beginning of the earliest reporting period presented we have not retrospectively restated the contract for those modification we have disclosed the aggregate effect of all modification when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligation for purpose of determining the transaction price and allocating the transaction price at transition research and development research and development expense consists primarily of personnel cost for our engineer and third party engaged in the design and development of our product software and technology including salary bonus and stock based compensation expense project material cost service and depreciation such cost are charged to research and development expense they are incurred stock based compensation expense we recognize compensation expense for time based restricted stock unit rsus using the straight line amortization method based on the fair value of rsus on the date of grant the fair value of rsus is the closing market price of broadcom common stock on the date of grant reduced by the present value of dividend expected to be paid on broadcom common stock prior to vesting we recognize compensation expense for time based stock option and employee stock purchase plan right under the broadcom inc employee stock purchase plan amended espp based on the estimated grant date fair value determined using the black scholes valuation model with straight line amortization method certain equity award include both service and market condition the fair value of market based award is estimated on the date of grant using the monte carlo simulation technique compensation expense for market based award is amortized based upon graded vesting method over the service period we estimate forfeiture expected to occur and recognize stock based compensation expense for such award expected to vest change in the estimated forfeiture rate can have significant effect on stock based compensation expense since the effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed shipping and handling cost our shipping and handling cost charged to customer are included in net revenue and the associated expense is included in total cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operation for all period presented of contentslitigation and settlement cost we are involved in legal action and other matter arising in our recent business acquisition and in the normal course of business we recognize an estimated loss contingency when the outcome is probable prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statement and we are able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any possible loss tax on income we account for income tax under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax asset and liability for the expected future tax consequence of event that have been included in the consolidated financial statement under this method deferred tax asset and liability are determined based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement and tax base of asset and liability using enacted tax rate in effect for the year in which the difference are expected to reverse the effect of change in tax rate on deferred tax asset and liability is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date we recognize net deferred tax asset to the extent we believe these asset will more likely than not be realized in making such determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liability projected future taxable income tax planning strategy and recent financial operation if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred income tax asset in the future in excess of their net carrying value we adjust the valuation allowance and reduce the provision for income tax likewise if we determine that we are not able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset we increase the provision for income tax in the period such determination is made we account for uncertainty in income tax in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on income tax this guidance provides that tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeal or litigation process based on the technical merit net income per share basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock by the weighted average number of share of common stock outstanding during the period diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock by the weighted average number of share of common stock and potentially dilutive share of common stock outstanding during the period diluted share outstanding include the dilutive effect of in the money stock option unvested rsus and espp right together referred to equity award well convertible preferred stock and lp unit potentially dilutive share whose effect would have been antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share the dilutive effect of equity award is calculated based on the average stock price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method under the treasury stock method the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock option and purchasing share under the espp and the amount of compensation cost for future service that we have not yet recognized are collectively assumed to be used to repurchase share the dilutive effect of convertible preferred stock and lp unit is calculated using the if converted method the if converted method assumes that these security were converted at the beginning of the reporting period to the extent that the effect is dilutive reclassification certain reclassification have been made to the prior period consolidated balance sheet statement of operation statement of cash flow and statement of equity these reclassification have no impact on the previously reported total stockholder equity net income or net cash activity recently adopted accounting guidancein the first quarter of fiscal year we adopted the financial accounting standard board fasb guidance issued in march that requires an employer to present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same income statement line item other employee compensation cost arising from service rendered during the period other component of the net periodic benefit cost are presented separately from the service cost component we adopted the guidance using permitted practical expedient that us the amount disclosed in the pension and other post retirement benefit plan note for the prior comparative period the estimation basis for applying the retrospective presentation requirement the adoption did not have material impact on the consolidated statement of operation presented herein in the first quarter of fiscal year we adopted the guidance issued in january that change the accounting for equity investment financial liability under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirement for financial instrument this guidance requires the remeasurement of equity investment not accounted for under the equity method to be measured at fair value and any change in fair value recognized in net income the guidance allows for election of measurement alternative for equity security without readily determinable fair value to be measured at cost le impairment adjusted for observable price change we adopted this guidance using the modified retrospective method for our marketable equity security and prospective approach for non marketable equity security using the measurement alternative upon adoption we recognized an million increase to retained earnings and million increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss during the fiscal year ended november we also recognized million of unrealized gain on equity security within other income net in our consolidated statement of operation of contentsin may the fasb issued asu revenue from

closing balance november we adopted topic immediately prior to the ca merger accordingly the opening balance doe not include contract asset or contract liability associated with ca of contentschanges in our contract asset and contract liability primarily result from the timing difference between our performance and the customer payment we fulfill our obligation under contract with customer by

contract where the customer is not committed the customer is not considered committed when termination for convenience without payment of substantive penalty exists this ha been extended to all ca customer either contractually or through customary business practice additionally practical expedient we have not included contract that have an original duration of one year or le nor have we included contract with sale based and usage based royalty promised in exchange for license of intellectual property because the substantial majority of our customer contract allow our customer to terminate for convenience or have an original duration of one year or le the total amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligation of november wa not significant since our customer generally do not exercise their termination for convenience right and the majority of the contract we execute for product well subscription and service have duration of one year or le our remaining performance obligation are not indicative of revenue for future period contract costswe have applied the practical expedient to expense commission cost incurred for cost to obtain contract when the amortization period would have been one year or le result no commission cost are capitalized we recognize an asset for cost incurred to fulfill contract that are not within the scope of other
