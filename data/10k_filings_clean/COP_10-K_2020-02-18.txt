equity method and unproved property although it is not reasonably practicable to quantify the impact of any future impairment at this time our result of operation could be adversely affected result our ability to declare and pay dividend and repurchase share is subject to certain consideration dividend are authorized and determined by our board of director in it sole discretion and depend upon number of factor including cash available for distribution our result of operation and anticipated future result of operation our financial condition especially in relation to the anticipated future capital need of our property the level of distribution paid by comparable company our operating expense other factor our board of director deems relevant we expect to continue to pay quarterly dividend to our stockholder however our board of director may reduce our dividend or cease declaring dividend at any time including if it determines that our net cash provided by operating activity after deducting capital expenditure and investment are not sufficient to pay our desired level of dividend to our stockholder or to pay dividend to our stockholder at all additionally of december billion of repurchase authority remained of the billion share repurchase program our board of director had authorized in february our board of director approved an increase to our repurchase authorization from billion to billion to support our plan for future share repurchase our share repurchase program doe not obligate to acquire specific number of share during any period and our decision to commence discontinue or resume repurchase in any period will depend on the factor that our board of director may consider when declaring dividend among others any downward revision in the amount of dividend we pay to stockholder or the number of share we purchase under our share repurchase program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock we may need additional capital in the future and it may not be available on acceptable term we have historically relied primarily upon cash generated by our operation to fund our operation and strategy however we have also relied from time to time on access to the debt and equity capital market for funding there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available in the future on acceptable term or at all in addition although we anticipate we will be able to repay our existing indebtedness when it matures or in accordance with our stated plan there can be no assurance we will be able to do so our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures or in accordance with our plan will be subject to number of factor including market condition our operating performance investor sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with agreement governing our outstanding debt if we are unable to generate sufficient fund from operation or raise additional capital for any reason our business could be adversely affected in addition we are regularly evaluated by the major rating agency based on number of factor including our financial strength and condition affecting the oil and gas industry generally we and other industry company have had their rating reduced in the past due to negative commodity price outlook any downgrade in our credit rating or announcement that our credit rating is under review for possible downgrade could increase the cost associated with any additional indebtedness we incur our business may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of or default under our contract with third party with we do business the operation of our business requires to engage in transaction with numerous counterparties operating in variety of industry including other company operating in the oil and gas industry these counterparties may default on their obligation to result of operational failure or lack of liquidity or for other reason including bankruptcy market speculation about the credit quality of these counterparties or their ability to continue performing on their existing obligation may also exacerbate any operational difficulty or liquidity issue they are experiencing particularly it relates to other company in the oil and gas industry result of the volatility in commodity price any default by any of our counterparties may result in our inability to perform our obligation under agreement we have made with third party or may otherwise adversely affect our business or result of operation in addition our right any of our counterparties result of default may not be adequate to compensate for the resulting harm caused or may not be enforceable at all in some circumstance we may also be forced to incur additional cost we attempt to enforce any right we have against defaulting counterparty which could further adversely impact our result of operation in particular in august we entered into settlement agreement with petrleos de venezuela pdvsa providing for the payment of approximately billion over five year period in connection with an arbitration award issued by the international chamber of commerce icc tribunal in favor of conocophillips on contractual dispute arising from venezuela expropriation of our interest in the petrozuata and hamaca heavy oil venture and other pre expropriation fiscal measure we collected approximately billion of the billion settlement in and pdvsa ha defaulted on it remaining payment obligation under this agreement we are therefore forced to incur additional cost we seek to recover any unpaid amount under the agreement unless we successfully add to our existing proved reserve our future crude oil bitumen natural gas and ngl production will decline resulting in an adverse impact to our business the rate of production from upstream field generally decline reserve are depleted if we do not conduct successful exploration and development activity or through engineering study optimize production performance or identify additional or secondary recovery reserve our proved reserve will decline materially we produce crude oil bitumen natural gas and ngls and our business will experience reduced cash flow and result of operation any cash conservation effort we may undertake result of commodity price decline may further limit our ability to replace depleted reserve the exploration and production of oil and gas is highly competitive industry the exploration and production of crude oil bitumen natural gas and ngls is highly competitive business we compete with private public and state owned company in all facet of the exploration and production business including to locate and obtain new source of supply and to produce oil bitumen natural gas and ngls in an efficient cost effective manner some of our competitor are larger and have greater resource than we do or may be willing to incur higher level of risk than we are willing to incur to obtain potential source of supply if we are not successful in our competition for new reserve our financial condition and result of operation may be adversely affected any material change in the factor and assumption underlying our estimate of crude oil bitumen natural gas and ngl reserve could impair the quantity and value of those reserve our proved reserve information included in this annual report represents management best estimate based on assumption of specified date of the volume to be recovered from underground accumulation of crude oil bitumen natural gas and ngls such volume can not be directly measured and the estimate and underlying assumption used by management are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty any material change in the factor and assumption underlying our estimate of these item could result in material negative impact to the volume of reserve reported or could cause to incur impairment expense on property associated with the production of those reserve future reserve revision could also result from change in among other thing governmental regulation we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditure and operating cost result of our compliance with existing and future environmental law and regulation our business is subject to numerous law and regulation relating to the protection of the environment which are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operation in the and in other country in which we operate for description of the most significant of these environmental law and regulation see the contingency environmental section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation these law and regulation continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operation with respect to among other thing permit required in connection with exploration drilling production and other activity the discharge of pollutant into the environment emission into the atmosphere such nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide mercury and ghg emission carbon tax the handling use storage transportation disposal and cleanup of hazardous material and hazardous and nonhazardous waste the dismantlement abandonment and restoration of our property and facility at the end of their useful life exploration and production activity in certain area such offshore environment arctic field oil sand reservoir and unconventional play we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditure result of these law and regulation any failure by to comply with existing or future law regulation and other requirement could result in administrative or civil penalty criminal fine other enforcement action or third party litigation against to the extent these expenditure with all cost are not ultimately reflected in the price of our product and service our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow in future period could be materially adversely affected existing and future law regulation and initiative relating to global climate change such limitation on ghg emission may impact or limit our business plan result in significant expenditure promote alternative us of energy or reduce demand for our product continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change ha resulted in both existing and pending international agreement and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measure to limit ghg emission such cap and trade regime carbon tax restrictive permitting increased fuel efficiency standard and incentive or mandate for renewable energy for example in december the joined the international community at the conference of the party of the united nation framework convention on climate change in paris that prepared an agreement requiring member country to review and represent progression in their intended ghg emission reduction goal every five year beginning in while the announced it intention to withdraw from the paris agreement there is no guarantee that the commitment made by the will not be implemented in whole or in part by state and local government or by major corporation headquartered in the in addition our operation continue in country around the world which are party to and have not announced an intent to withdraw from the paris agreement the implementation of current agreement and regulatory measure well any future agreement or measure addressing climate change and ghg emission may adversely impact the demand for our product impose tax on our product or operation or require to purchase emission credit or reduce emission of ghgs from our operation result we may experience decline in commodity price or incur substantial capital expenditure and compliance operating maintenance and remediation cost any of which may have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation additionally increasing attention to global climate change ha resulted in pressure upon shareholder financial institution and or financial market to modify their relationship with oil and gas company and to limit investment and or funding to such company which could increase our cost or otherwise adversely affect our business and result of operation furthermore increasing attention to global climate change ha resulted in an increased likelihood of governmental investigation and private litigation which could increase our cost or otherwise adversely affect our business in and city county and state government in california new york washington rhode island and maryland well the pacific coast federation of fisherman association inc filed lawsuit against oil and gas company including conocophillips seeking compensatory damage and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impact conocophillips is vigorously defending against these lawsuit the ultimate outcome and impact to can not be predicted with certainty and we could incur substantial legal cost associated with defending these and similar lawsuit in the future in addition although we design and operate our business operation to accommodate expected climatic condition to the extent there are significant change in the earth climate such more severe or frequent weather condition in the market where we operate or the area where our asset reside we could incur increased expense our operation could be adversely impacted and demand for our product could fall for more information on legislation or precursor for possible regulation relating to global climate change that affect or could affect our operation and description of the company response see the contingency climate change section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation domestic and worldwide political and economic development could damage our operation and materially reduce our profitability and cash flow action of the state local and foreign government through sanction tax and other legislation executive order and commercial restriction could reduce our operating profitability both in the and abroad in certain location government have imposed or proposed restriction on our operation special tax or tax assessment and payment transparency regulation that could require to disclose competitively sensitive information or might cause to violate non disclosure law of other country one area subject to significant political and regulatory activity is the use of hydraulic fracturing an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formation range of local state federal and national law and regulation currently govern or in some hydraulic fracturing operation prohibit hydraulic fracturing in some jurisdiction although hydraulic fracturing ha been conducted for many decade number of new law regulation and permitting requirement are under consideration by the epa and others which could result in increased cost operating restriction operational delay or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resource certain jurisdiction in which we operate including state and local government in colorado have adopted or are considering regulation that could impose new or more stringent permitting disclosure or other regulatory requirement on hydraulic fracturing or other oil and natural gas operation including subsurface water disposal in addition certain interest group have also proposed ballot initiative and constitutional amendment designed to restrict oil and natural gas development generally and hydraulic fracturing in particular for example in colorado voter rejected proposition colorado ballot initiative that would have drastically limited the use of hydraulic fracturing in colorado in the event that ballot initiative local or state restriction or prohibition are adopted and result in more stringent limitation on the production and development of oil and natural gas in area where we conduct operation we may incur significant cost to comply with such requirement or may experience delay or curtailment in the permitting or pursuit of exploration development or production activity such compliance cost and delay curtailment limitation or prohibition could have material adverse effect on our business prospect result of operation financial condition and liquidity the government can also prevent or restrict from business in foreign country these restriction and those of foreign government have in the past limited our ability to operate in or gain access to opportunity in various country action by host government such the expropriation of our oil asset by the venezuelan government have affected operation significantly in the past and may continue to do so in the future change in domestic and international regulation may affect our ability to collect payment such those pertaining to the settlement with pdvsa or the icsid award against the government of venezuela or to obtain or maintain permit including those necessary for drilling and development of well in various location local political and economic factor in international market could have material adverse effect on approximately percent of our hydrocarbon production wa derived from production outside the in and percent of our proved reserve of december were located outside the we are subject to risk associated with operation in international market including change in foreign governmental policy relating to crude oil natural gas bitumen ngls or lng pricing and taxation other political economic or diplomatic development including the effect of international trade discussion and dispute changing political condition and international monetary and currency rate fluctuation in addition some country where we operate lack fully independent judiciary system this coupled with change in foreign law or policy result in lack of legal certainty that expose our operation to increased risk including increased difficulty in enforcing our agreement in those jurisdiction and increased risk of adverse action by local government authority such expropriation our business may be adversely affected by price control government imposed limitation on production of crude oil bitumen natural gas and ngls or the unavailability of adequate gathering processing compression transportation and pipeline facility and equipment for our production of crude oil bitumen natural gas and ngls discussed our operation are subject to extensive governmental regulation from time to time regulatory agency have imposed price control and limitation on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil bitumen natural gas and ngl well below actual production capacity legal requirement are frequently changed and subject to interpretation we can not predict whether future restriction on our business may be enacted or become applicable to our ability to sell and deliver the crude oil bitumen natural gas ngls and lng that we produce also depends on the availability proximity and capacity of gathering processing compression transportation and pipeline facility and equipment well any necessary diluent to prepare our crude oil bitumen natural gas ngls and lng for transport the facility equipment and diluent we rely on may be temporarily unavailable to due to market condition extreme weather event regulatory reason mechanical reason or other factor or condition many of which are beyond our control in addition in certain newer play the capacity of necessary facility equipment and diluent may not be sufficient to accommodate production from existing and new well and construction and permitting delay permitting cost and regulatory or other constraint could limit or delay the construction manufacture or other acquisition of new facility and equipment if any facility equipment or diluent or any of the transportation method and channel that we rely on become unavailable for any period of time we may incur increased cost to transport our crude oil bitumen natural gas ngls and lng for sale or we may be forced to curtail our production of crude oil bitumen natural gas or ngls our investment in joint venture decrease our ability to manage risk we conduct many of our operation through joint venture in which we may share control with our joint venture partner there is risk our joint venture participant may at any time have economic business or legal interest or goal that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or or our joint venture partner may be unable to meet their economic or other obligation and we may be required to fulfill those obligation alone failure by or an entity in which we have joint venture interest to adequately manage the risk associated with any operation acquisition or disposition could have material adverse effect on the financial condition or result of operation of our joint venture and in turn our business and operation we may not be able to successfully complete any disposition we elect to pursue from time to time we may seek to divest portion of our business or investment that are not important to our ongoing strategic objective any disposition we undertake may involve numerous risk and uncertainty any of which could adversely affect our result of operation or financial condition in particular we may not be able to successfully complete any disposition on timeline or on term acceptable to if at all whether due to market condition regulatory challenge or other concern in addition the reinvestment of capital from disposition proceeds may not ultimately yield investment return in line with our internal or external expectation any disposition we pursue may also result in disruption to other part of our business including through the diversion of resource and management attention from our ongoing business and other strategic matter or through the disruption of relationship with our employee and key vendor further in connection with any disposition we may enter into transition service agreement or undertake indemnity or other obligation that may result in additional expense for we may also be required under applicable accounting rule to recognize impairment associated with any disposition we pursue whether or not completed part of our disposition strategy on may we completed the sale of our percent nonoperated interest in the fccl partnership well the majority of our western canada gas asset to cenovus energy consideration for the transaction included million cenovus energy common share we may not be able to liquidate the share issued to by cenovus energy at price we deem acceptable or at all our operation present hazard and risk that require significant and continuous oversight the scope and nature of our operation present variety of significant hazard and risk including operational hazard and risk such explosion fire crude oil spill severe weather geological event labor dispute armed hostility terrorist attack sabotage civil unrest or cyber attack our operation may also be adversely affected by unavailability interruption or accident involving service or infrastructure required to develop produce process or transport our production such contract labor drilling rig pipeline railcar tanker barge or other infrastructure our operation are subject to the additional hazard of pollution release of toxic gas and other environmental hazard and risk offshore activity may pose incrementally greater risk because of complex subsurface condition such higher reservoir pressure water depth and metocean condition all such hazard could result in loss of human life significant property and equipment damage environmental pollution impairment of operation substantial loss to and damage to our reputation further our business and operation may be disrupted if we do not respond or are perceived not to respond in an appropriate manner to any of these hazard and risk or any other major crisis or if we are unable to efficiently restore or replace affected operational component and capacity our technology system and network may be subject to cyber attack our business like others within the oil and gas industry ha become increasingly dependent on digital technology some of which are managed by third party service provider on whom we rely to help collect host or process information among other activity we rely on digital technology to estimate oil and gas reserve process and record financial and operating data analyze seismic and drilling information and communicate with employee and third party result we face various cyber security threat such attempt to gain unauthorized access to or control of sensitive information about our operation and our employee attempt to render our data or system or those of third party with whom we do business corrupted or unusable threat to the security of our facility and infrastructure well those of third party with whom we do business and attempted cyber terrorism in addition computer control oil and gas production processing equipment and distribution system globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market disruption failure or cyber breach of these operating system or of the network and infrastructure on which they rely many of which are not owned or operated by could damage critical production distribution or storage asset delay or prevent delivery to market or make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transaction although we have experienced occasional breach of our cyber security none of these breach have had material effect on our business operation or reputation cyber attack continue to evolve we must continually expend additional resource to continue to modify or enhance our protective measure or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability detected our implementation of various procedure and control to monitor and mitigate security threat and to increase security for our information facility and infrastructure may result in increased cost despite our ongoing investment in security resource talent and business practice we are unable to assure that any security measure will be effective if our system and infrastructure were to be breached damaged or disrupted we could be subject to serious negative consequence including disruption of our operation damage to our reputation loss of counterparty trust reimbursement or other cost increased compliance cost significant litigation exposure and legal liability or regulatory fine penalty or intervention any of these could materially and adversely affect our business result of operation or financial condition although we have business continuity plan in place our operation may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our system and infrastructure that support our business while we continue to evolve and modify our business continuity plan there can be no assurance that they will be effective in avoiding disruption and business impact further our insurance may not be adequate to compensate for all resulting loss and the cost to obtain

averaged per barrel in ranging from low of per barrel in january to high of almost per barrel in april the energy industry ha periodically experienced this type of volatility due to fluctuating supply and demand condition and such volatility may persist for the foreseeable future commodity price are the most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of operating cash flow into our business our strategy is to create value through price cycle by delivering on the foundational principle that underpin our value proposition focus on financial return through cash flow expansion maintain balance sheet strength and deliver peer leading distribution operational and financial factor affecting profitability the focus area we believe will drive our success through the price cycle include maintain relentless focus on safety and environmental stewardship safety and environmental stewardship including the operating integrity of our asset remain our highest priority and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone ha role in our operation and the community in which we operate we strive to conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business growth demonstrating our commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship on november we announced our intention to target to percent reduction in our ghg emission intensity by in december we became founding member of the climate leadership council clc an international policy institute founded in collaboration with business and environmental interest to develop carbon dividend plan participation in the clc provides another opportunity for ongoing dialogue about carbon pricing and framing the issue in alignment with our public policy principle we also belong to and fund american for carbon dividend the education and advocacy branch of the clc in early we issued our first stand alone climate related risk report and incorporated this into our website during our annual sustainability report update our sustainability effort continued through with focus on advancing our action plan for climate change biodiversity water and human right we are committed to building learning organization using human performance principle we relentlessly pursue improved hse and operational performance focus on financial return this is core principle of our value proposition our goal is to achieve strong financial return by exercising capital discipline controlling our cost and continually optimizing our portfolio maintain capital allocation discipline we participate in commodity price driven and capital intensive industry with varying lead time from when an investment decision is made to the time an asset is operational and generates cash flow result we must invest significant capital dollar to explore for new oil and gas field develop newly discovered field maintain existing field and construct pipeline and lng facility we allocate capital across geographically diverse low cost of supply resource base which combined with legacy asset result in low production decline cost of supply is the wti equivalent price that generates percent after tax return on point forward and fully burdened basis fully burdened includes capital infrastructure foreign exchange price related inflation and in setting our capital plan we exercise rigorous approach that evaluates project using this cost of supply criterion which should lead to value maximization and cash flow expansion using an optimized investment pace not production growth for growth sake additional capital may be allocated toward growth but discipline will be maintained our cash allocation priority call for the investment of sufficient capital to sustain production and pay the existing dividend in february we announced operating plan capital of billion to billion the plan includes funding for ongoing development drilling program major project exploration and appraisal activity well base maintenance capital spend is expected to be higher in the first quarter largely from winter construction and exploration and appraisal drilling in alaska this guidance doe not include capital for acquisition control cost and expense controlling operating and overhead cost without compromising safety and environmental stewardship is high priority we monitor these cost using various methodology that are reported to senior management monthly on both an absolute dollar basis and per unit basis managing operating and overhead cost is critical to maintaining competitive position in our industry particularly in low commodity price environment the ability to control our operating and overhead cost impact our ability to deliver strong cash from operation in our production and operating expense were two percent higher than primarily due to cost associated with higher production volume which grew five percent during the same period optimize our portfolio we continue to optimize our asset portfolio to focus on low cost of supply asset that support our strategy in we continued to dispose of or market certain non core asset including the australia west and our niobrara asset in the lower addition to the portfolio were made in the lower with bolt on interest and acreage acquisition in alaska with the nuna discovery acreage acquisition and internationally with entrance into argentina neuqun and austral basin we will continue to evaluate our asset to determine whether they compete for capital within our portfolio and will optimize the portfolio necessary directing capital towards the most competitive investment maintain balance sheet strength we believe balance sheet strength is critical in cyclical business such our strong operating performance buffered by solid balance sheet enables to deliver on our priority through the price cycle our priority include execution of our development plan maintaining growing dividend and repurchasing share on dollar cost average basis return value to shareholder we believe in delivering value to our shareholder via growing sustainable dividend supplemented by share repurchase in we paid dividend on our common stock of approximately billion and repurchased billion of our common stock combined our dividend and repurchase represented percent of our net cash provided by operating activity since we initiated our current share repurchase program in late we have repurchased billion of share additionally of december billion of repurchase authority remained of the billion share repurchase program our board of director had authorized in february we announced that the board of director approved an increase to our repurchase authorization from billion to billion to support our plan for future share repurchase whether we undertake these additional repurchase is ultimately subject to numerous consideration including market condition and other factor see risk factor our ability to declare and pay dividend and repurchase share is subject to certain consideration in october we announced that our board of director approved an increase to our quarterly dividend of percent to per share add to our proved reserve base we primarily add to our proved reserve base in three way successful exploration exploitation and development of new and existing field application of new technology and process to improve recovery from existing field purchase of increased interest in existing field and bolt on acquisition proved reserve estimate require economic production based on historical month first of month average price and current cost therefore our proved reserve generally increase price rise and decrease price decline reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserve net of production divided by our current year production shown in our supplemental reserve table disclosure in our reserve replacement which included net decrease of billion boe from sale and purchase wa percent increased crude oil reserve accounted for approximately percent of the total change in reserve our organic reserve replacement which excludes the impact of sale and purchase wa percent in approximately percent of organic reserve addition were from lower unconventional asset the remaining addition were evenly distributed across the other operating segment in the five year ended december our reserve replacement wa negative percent reflecting the impact of asset disposition and lower price during that period our organic reserve replacement during the five year ended december which excludes decrease of billion boe related to sale and purchase wa percent reflecting development activity well lower price during that period historically our reserve replacement ha varied considerably year to year contingent upon the timing of major project which may have long lead time between capital investment and production in the last several year more of our capital ha been allocated to short cycle time onshore unconventional play accordingly we believe our recent success in replacing reserve can be viewed on trailing three year basis in the three year ended december our reserve replacement wa percent reflecting the impact of asset disposition during that period our organic reserve replacement during the three year ended december which excludes decrease of billion boe related to sale and purchase wa percent reflecting reserve addition from development activity access to additional resource may become increasingly difficult commodity price can make project uneconomic or unattractive in addition prohibition of direct investment in some nation national fiscal term political instability competition from national oil company and lack of access to high potential area due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base such the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may or may not allow to replace our production over subsequent year apply technical capability we leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely deliver on our plan technical strength is part of our heritage and allows to economically convert additional resource to reserve achieve greater operating efficiency and reduce our environmental impact companywide we continue to evaluate potential solution to leverage knowledge of technological success across our operation we have embraced the digital

to fill critical skill and maintain broad range of expertise and experience we promote continued learning development and technical training through structured development program designed to enhance the technical and functional skill of our employee other factor affecting profitability other significant factor that can affect our profitability include energy commodity price our earnings and operating cash flow generally correlate with industry price level for crude oil and natural gas industry price level are subject to factor external to the company and over which we have no control including but not limited to global economic health supply disruption or fear thereof caused by civil unrest or military conflict action taken by opec environmental law tax regulation governmental policy and weather related disruption the following graph depicts the average benchmark price for wti crude oil brent crude oil and henry hub natural gas brent crude oil price averaged per barrel in decrease of percent compared with per barrel in similarly wti crude oil price decreased percent from per barrel in to per barrel in crude oil price weakened year over year primarily due to ample global supply and decelerating global economy henry hub natural gas price average decreased percent from per mmbtu in to per mmbtu in natural gas price weakened in versus the prior year due to strong production while demand growth wa dampened by mild weather our realized ngl price decreased percent from per barrel in to per barrel in ngl price weakened year over year due to strong supply growth with only moderate demand growth our realized bitumen price increased percent from per barrel in to per barrel in curtailment order imposed by the alberta government which limited production from the province starting january provided strength to the wcs differential to wti at hardisty we continue to optimize bitumen price realization through the utilization of downstream transportation solution and implementation of alternate blend capability which result in lower diluent cost our worldwide annual average realized price decreased percent from per boe in to per boe in due to lower realized oil natural gas and ngl price north america energy supply landscape ha been transformed from one of resource scarcity to one of abundance in recent year the use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in unconventional formation ha led to increased industry actual and forecasted crude oil and natural gas production in the although providing significant short and long term growth opportunity for our company the increased abundance of crude oil and natural gas due to development of unconventional play could also have adverse financial implication to including an extended period of low commodity price production curtailment and delay of plan to develop area such unconventional field should one or more of these event occur our revenue would be reduced and additional asset impairment might be possible impairment we participate in capital intensive industry at time our pp and investment become impaired when for example commodity price decline significantly for long period of time our reserve estimate are revised downward or decision to dispose of an asset lead to write down to it fair value we may also invest large amount of money in exploration which if exploratory drilling prof unsuccessful could lead to material impairment of leasehold value we optimize our asset in the future it is reasonably possible we may incur future loss upon sale or impairment charge to long lived asset used in operation investment in nonconsolidated entity accounted for under the equity method and unproved property sustained decline in the current and long term outlook on gas price could affect the carrying value of certain lower non core gas asset and it is reasonably possible this could result in future non cash impairment for additional information on our

development activity reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserve net of production divided by our current year production shown in our supplemental reserve table disclosure for additional information about our capital budget see the capital budget section within capital resource and liquidity and for additional information on proved reserve including both developed and undeveloped reserve see the oil and gas operation section of this report discussed in the critical accounting estimate section engineering estimate of proved reserve are imprecise therefore each year reserve may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of change in commodity price or more technical data becomes available on reservoir we have reported revision increase to reserve in the current period however in prior period reported revision decrease to reserve it is not possible to reliably predict revision will impact reserve quantity in the future investing activity proceeds from asset sale in were billion we completed the sale of two conocophillips subsidiary to chrysaor limited for billion we also completed the sale of several asset including our percent interest in the

been filed against conocophillips we also may be required to remove or mitigate the effect on the environment of the placement storage disposal or release of certain chemical mineral and petroleum substance at various active and inactive site we regularly ass the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingency in the case of all known contingency other than those related to income tax we accrue liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if range of amount can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is better estimate than any other amount then the minimum of the range is accrued we do not reduce these liability for potential insurance or third party recovery if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recovery with respect to income tax related contingency we use cumulative probability weighted loss accrual in case where sustaining tax position is le than certain based on currently available information we believe it is remote that future cost related to known contingent liability exposure will exceed current accrual by an amount that would have material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statement for information on other contingency see critical accounting estimate and note contingency and commitment in the note to consolidated financial statement legal

judgment and experience in using these litigation management tool and available information about current development in all our case our legal organization regularly ass the adequacy of current accrual and determines if adjustment of existing accrual or establishment of new accrual is required see note income tax in the note to consolidated financial statement for additional information about income tax related contingency environmental we are subject to the same numerous international federal state and local environmental law and regulation other company in our industry the most significant of these environmental law and regulation include among others the federal clean air act which governs air emission federal clean water act which governs discharge to water body european union regulation for registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical reach federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund which imposes liability on generator transporter and arranger of hazardous substance at site where hazardous substance release have occurred or are threatening to occur federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra which governs the treatment storage and disposal of solid waste federal oil pollution act of under which owner and operator of onshore facility and pipeline lessee or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located and owner and operator of vessel are liable for removal cost and damage that result from discharge of oil into navigable water of the federal emergency planning and community right to know act epcra which requires facility to report toxic chemical inventory with local emergency planning committee and response department federal safe drinking water act which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection well department of the interior regulation which relate to offshore oil and gas operation in water and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operation well potential liability for pollution damage european union trading directive resulting in european emission trading scheme these law and their implementing regulation set limit on emission and in the case of discharge to water establish water quality limit and establish standard and impose obligation for the remediation of release of hazardous substance and hazardous waste they also in most case require permit in association with new or modified operation these permit can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process which can be expensive and time consuming in addition there can be delay associated with notice and comment period and the agency processing of the application many of the delay associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant many state and foreign country where we operate also have or are developing similar environmental law and regulation governing these same type of activity while similar in some case these regulation may impose additional or more stringent requirement that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting product across state and international border the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental law and regulation is neither clearly known easily determinable new standard such air emission standard and water quality standard continue to evolve however environmental law and regulation including those that may arise to address concern about global climate change are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operation in the and in other country in which we operate notable area of potential impact include air emission compliance and remediation obligation in the and canada an example is the use of hydraulic fracturing an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formation range of local state federal or national law and regulation currently govern hydraulic fracturing operation with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdiction although hydraulic fracturing ha been conducted for many decade number of new law regulation and permitting requirement are under consideration by various state environmental agency and others which could result in increased cost operating restriction operational delay and or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resource governmental restriction on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investment we have adopted operating principle that incorporate established industry standard designed to meet or exceed government requirement our practice continually evolve technology improves and regulation change we also are subject to certain law and regulation relating to environmental remediation obligation associated with current and past operation such law and regulation include cercla and rcra and their state equivalent longer term expenditure are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly we occasionally receive request for information or notice of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agency alleging we are potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute on occasion we also have been made party to cost recovery litigation by those agency or by private party these request notice and lawsuit assert potential liability for remediation cost at various site that typically are not owned by but allegedly contain waste attributable to our past operation of december there were site around the in which we were identified potentially responsible party under cercla and comparable state law for most superfund site our potential liability will be significantly le than the total site remediation cost because the percentage of waste attributable to versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible party is relatively low although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal site and frequently so for state site other potentially responsible party at site where we are party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligation and where they have not or where potentially responsible party could not be located our share of liability ha not increased materially many of the site at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agency concerned prior to actual cleanup those potentially responsible normally ass site condition apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation in some instance we may have no liability or attain settlement of liability actual cleanup cost generally occur after the party obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval there are relatively few site where we are major participant and given the timing and amount of anticipated expenditure neither the cost of remediation at those site nor such cost at all cercla site in the aggregate is expected to have material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition expensed environmental cost were million in and are expected to be about million per year in and capitalized environmental cost were million in and are expected to be about million per year in and accrued liability for remediation activity are not reduced for potential recovery from insurer or other third party and are not discounted except those assumed in purchase business combination which we do record on discounted basis many of these liability result from cercla rcra and similar state or international law that require to undertake certain investigative and remedial activity at site where we conduct or once conducted operation or at site where conocophillips generated waste wa disposed the accrual also includes number of site we identified that may require environmental remediation but which are not currently the subject of cercla rcra or other agency enforcement activity the law that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively and regardless of fault the legality of the original activity or the current ownership or control of site if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recovery in the future we may incur significant cost under both cercla and rcra remediation activity vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site depending on the mix of unique site characteristic evolving remediation technology diverse regulatory agency and enforcement policy and the presence or absence of potentially liable third party therefore it is difficult to develop reasonable estimate of future site remediation cost at december our balance sheet included total accrued environmental cost of million compared with million at december for remediation activity in the and canada we expect to incur substantial amount of these expenditure within the next year notwithstanding any of the foregoing and with other company engaged in similar business environmental cost and liability are inherent concern in our operation and product and there can be no assurance that material cost and liability will not be incurred however we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our result of operation or financial position result of compliance with current environmental law and regulation climate change continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change ha resulted in broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international law focusing on ghg reduction these proposed or promulgated law apply or could apply in country where we have interest or may have interest in the future law in this field continue to evolve and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either timetable for implementation or our future compliance cost relating to implementation such law if enacted could have material impact on our result of operation and financial condition example of legislation or precursor for possible regulation that do or could affect our operation include european emission trading scheme ets the program through which many of the eu member state are implementing the kyoto protocol our cost of compliance with the eu ets in wa approximately million before tax the alberta carbon competitiveness incentive regulation ccir requires any existing facility with emission equal to or greater than metric tonne of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to meet an industry benchmark intensity the total cost of these regulation in wa approximately million the supreme court decision in massachusetts epa ct confirmed that the epa ha the authority to regulate carbon dioxide an air pollutant under the federal clean air act the epa announcement on march published interpretation of regulation that determine pollutant covered by clean air act permitting program fed reg april and the epa and department of transportation joint promulgation of final rule on april that trigger regulation of ghgs under the clean air act may trigger more climate based claim for damage and may result in longer agency review time for development project the epa announcement on january outlining series of step it plan to take to address methane and smog forming volatile organic compound emission from the oil and gas industry the former administration established goal of reducing the level in methane emission from the oil and gas industry by to percent by carbon tax in certain jurisdiction our cost of compliance with norwegian carbon tax legislation in wa approximately million net share before tax we also incur carbon tax for emission from fossil fuel combustion in our british columbia and alberta operation totaling over million net share before tax the agreement reached in paris in december at the conference of the party to the united nation framework on climate change setting out new process for achieving global emission reduction while the announced it intention to withdraw from the paris agreement there is no guarantee that the commitment made by the will not be implemented in whole or in part by state and local government or by major corporation headquartered in the in the some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state level with respect to ghg emission such regulation could take any of several form that may result in the creation of additional cost in the form of tax the restriction of output investment of capital to maintain compliance with law and regulation or required acquisition or trading of emission allowance we are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operation compliance with change in law and regulation that create ghg tax emission trading scheme or ghg reduction policy could significantly increase our cost reduce demand for fossil energy derived product impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation such law and regulation could also increase demand for le carbon intensive energy source including natural gas the ultimate impact on our financial performance either positive or negative will depend on number of factor including but not limited to whether and to extent legislation or regulation is enacted the timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation the nature of the legislation such cap and trade system or tax on emission or regulation the price placed on ghg emission either by the market or through tax the ghg reduction required the price and availability of offset the amount and allocation of allowance technological and scientific development leading to new product or service any potential significant physical effect of climate change such increased severe weather event change in sea level and change in temperature whether and the extent to which increased compliance cost are ultimately reflected in the price of our product and service the company ha responded by putting in place sustainable development risk management standard covering the assessment and registering of significant and high sustainable development risk based on their consequence and likelihood of occurrence we have developed company wide climate change action plan with the goal of tracking mitigation activity for each climate related risk included in the corporate sustainable development risk register the risk addressed in our climate change action plan fall into four broad category ghg related legislation and regulation ghg emission management physical climate related impact climate related disclosure and reporting emission are categorized into different scope scope and scope ghg emission help understand climate transition risk scope emission are direct ghg emission from source that we own or control scope emission are ghg emission from the generation of purchased electricity or steam that we consume our corporate authorization process requires all qualifying project to run ghg pricing sensitivity using corporate price of per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent plus annual inflation for all scope and scope ghg emission produced in and later project in jurisdiction with existing ghg pricing regime must incorporate that existing ghg price and it forecast into their base case economics where the existing ghg price is below the corporate price the per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent sensitivity must also be run from onward thus both existing and emerging regulatory requirement are considered in our decision making the company doe not use an estimated market cost of ghg emission when assessing reserve in jurisdiction without existing ghg regulation in december we became founding member of the clc an international policy institute founded in collaboration with business and environmental interest to develop carbon dividend plan participation in the clc provides another opportunity for ongoing dialogue about carbon pricing and framing the issue in alignment with our public policy principle we also belong to and fund american for carbon dividend the education and advocacy branch of the clc in and city county and state government in california new york washington rhode island and maryland well the pacific coast federation of fisherman association inc have filed lawsuit against oil and gas company including conocophillips seeking compensatory damage and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impact conocophillips is vigorously defending against these lawsuit the lawsuit brought by the city of san francisco oakland and new york have been dismissed by the district court and appeal are pending lawsuit filed by other city and county in california and washington are currently stayed pending resolution of the appeal brought by the city of san francisco and oakland to the court of appeal for the ninth circuit lawsuit filed in maryland and rhode island are proceeding in state court while ruling in those matter on the issue of whether the matter should proceed in state or federal court are on appeal to the court of appeal for the fourth circuit and first circuit respectively several louisiana parish and individual landowner have filed lawsuit against oil and gas company including conocophillips seeking compensatory damage in connection with historical oil and gas operation in louisiana all parish lawsuit are stayed pending an appeal to the fifth circuit court of appeal on the issue of whether they will proceed in federal or state court conocophillips will vigorously defend against these lawsuit other we have deferred tax asset related to certain accrued liability loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards valuation allowance have been established to reduce these deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized based on our historical taxable income our expectation for the future and available tax planning strategy management expects the net deferred tax asset will be realized offset to reversing deferred tax liability critical accounting estimate the preparation of financial statement in conformity with gaap requires management to select appropriate accounting policy and to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense see note accounting policy in the note to consolidated financial statement for description of our major accounting policy certain of these accounting policy involve judgment and uncertainty to such an extent there is reasonable likelihood materially different amount would have been reported under different condition or if different assumption had been used these critical accounting estimate are discussed with the audit and finance committee of the board of director at least annually we believe the following discussion of critical accounting estimate along with the discussion of deferred tax asset valuation allowance in this report address all important accounting area where the nature of accounting estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matter or the susceptibility of such matter to change oil and gas accounting accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rule unique to the oil and gas industry the acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information prior to the discovery of proved reserve is expensed incurred similar to accounting for research and development cost however leasehold acquisition cost and exploratory well cost are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserve have been recognized property acquisition cost for individually significant leasehold management periodically ass for impairment based on exploration and drilling effort to date for relatively small individual leasehold acquisition cost management exercise judgment and determines percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserve and pool that leasehold information with others in the geographic area for prospect in area with limited or no previous exploratory drilling the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high this judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense this judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leasehold and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively at year end the remaining billion of net capitalized unproved property cost consisted primarily of individually significant leasehold mineral right held in perpetuity by title ownership exploratory well currently being drilled suspended exploratory well and capitalized interest of this amount approximately billion is concentrated in major development area the majority of which are not expected to move to proved property in and billion is held for sale management periodically ass individually significant leasehold for impairment based on the result of exploration and drilling effort and the outlook for commercialization exploratory cost for exploratory well drilling cost are temporarily capitalized or suspended on the balance sheet pending determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserve have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development if exploratory well encounter potentially economic quantity of oil and gas the well cost remain capitalized on the balance sheet long sufficient progress assessing the reserve and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made the accounting notion of sufficient progress is judgmental area but the accounting rule do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well cost on the expectation future market condition will improve or new technology will be found that would make the development economically profitable often the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserve is dependent on obtaining permit and government or co venturer approval the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control exploratory well cost remain suspended long we are actively pursuing such approval and permit and believe they will be obtained once all required approval and permit have been obtained the project are moved into the development phase and the oil and gas reserve are designated proved reserve for complex exploratory discovery it is not unusual to have exploratory well remain suspended on the balance sheet for several year while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co venturer approval of development plan or seek environmental permitting once determination is made the well not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantity the well cost are expensed dry hole and reported in exploration expense management review suspended well balance quarterly continuously monitor the result of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work and expense the suspended well cost dry hole when it determines the potential field doe not warrant further investment in the near term criterion utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristic and hydrocarbon property expected development cost ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserve fiscal term regulation or contract negotiation and our expected return on investment at year end total suspended well cost were million compared with million at year end for additional information on suspended well including an aging analysis see note suspended well and other exploration expense in the note to consolidated financial statement proved reserve engineering estimate of the quantity of proved reserve are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amount because of the judgment involved in developing such information reserve estimate are based on geological and engineering assessment of in place hydrocarbon volume the production plan historical extraction recovery and processing yield factor installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limit the reliability of these estimate at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbon despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimate accounting rule require disclosure of proved reserve estimate due to the importance of these estimate to better understand the perceived value and future cash flow of company operation there are several authoritative guideline regarding the engineering criterion that must be met before estimated reserve can be designated proved our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization ha policy and procedure in place consistent with these authoritative guideline we have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserve held by consolidated company well our share of equity affiliate proved reserve estimate are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant change occur and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field also required by current authoritative guideline the estimated future date when an asset will be permanently shut down for economic reason is based on month average price and current cost this estimated date when production will end affect the amount of estimated reserve therefore price and cost level change from year to year the estimate of proved reserve also change generally our proved reserve decrease price decline and increase price rise our proved reserve include estimated quantity related to pscs reported under the economic interest method well variable royalty regime and are subject to fluctuation in commodity price recoverable operating expense and capital cost if cost remain stable reserve quantity attributable to recovery of cost will change inversely to change in commodity price we would expect reserve from these contract to decrease when product price rise and increase when price decline the estimation of proved developed reserve also is important to the income statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for field serf the denominator in the unit of production calculation of the dd of the capitalized cost for that asset at year end the net book value of productive pp subject to unit of production calculation wa approximately billion and the dd recorded on these asset in wa approximately billion the estimated proved developed reserve for our consolidated operation were billion boe at the end of and billion boe at the end of if the estimate of proved reserve used in the unit of production calculation had been lower by percent across all calculation before tax dd in would have increased by an estimated million impairment long lived asset used in operation are assessed for impairment whenever change in fact and circumstance indicate possible significant deterioration in future cash flow expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following update to corporate planning assumption if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered the asset is monitored by management through an established process where change to significant assumption such price volume and future development plan are reviewed if upon review the sum of the undiscounted before tax cash flow is le than the carrying value of the asset group the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value individual asset are grouped for impairment purpose based on judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flow that are largely independent of the cash flow of other group of asset generally on field by field basis for asset because there usually is lack of quoted market price for long lived asset the fair value of impaired asset is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flow using discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participant or based on multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transaction of similar asset where possible the expected future cash flow used for impairment review and related fair value calculation are based on judgmental assessment of future production volume commodity price operating cost and capital decision considering all available information at the date of review differing assumption could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period see note impairment in the note to consolidated financial statement for additional information investment in nonconsolidated entity accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of loss in value and annually following update to corporate planning assumption such evidence of loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount or current fair value le than the investment carrying amount when it is determined such loss in value is other than temporary an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment carrying value and it estimated fair value when determining whether decline in value is other than temporary management considers factor such the length of time and extent of the decline the investee financial condition and near term prospect and our ability and intention to retain our investment for period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment since quoted market price are usually not available the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flow using discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participant plus market analysis of comparable asset owned by the investee if appropriate differing assumption could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period see the aplng section of note investment loan and long term receivables in the note to consolidated financial statement for additional information asset retirement obligation and environmental cost under various contract permit and regulation we have material legal obligation to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operation at operational site our largest asset removal obligation involve plugging and abandonment of well removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platform around the world well oil and gas production facility and pipeline in alaska the fair value of obligation for dismantling and removing these facility are recorded liability and an increase to pp at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted cost estimating future asset removal cost is difficult most of these removal obligation are many year or decade in the future and the contract and regulation often have vague description of what removal practice and criterion must be met when the removal event actually occurs asset removal technology and cost regulatory and other compliance consideration expenditure timing and other input into valuation of the obligation including discount and inflation rate are also subject to change normally change in asset removal obligation are reflected in the income statement increase or decrease to dd over the remaining life of the asset however for asset at or nearing the end of their operation well previously sold asset for which we retained the asset removal obligation an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings because any increase in pp due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment due to the low fair value of these property in addition to asset removal obligation under the above or similar contract permit and regulation we have certain environmental related project these are primarily related to remediation activity required by canada and various state within the at exploration and production site future environmental remediation cost are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factor the uncertain magnitude of cleanup cost the unknown time and extent of such remedial action that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible party see note asset retirement obligation and accrued environmental cost in the note to consolidated financial statement for additional information projected benefit obligation determination of the projected benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plan are important to the recorded amount for such obligation on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement the actuarial determination of projected benefit

of return on plan asset future health care cost trend rate and rate of utilization of health care service by retiree due to the specialized nature of these calculation we engage outside actuarial firm to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligation and company contribution requirement for employee retirement income security act governed pension plan the actuary exercise fiduciary care on behalf of plan participant in the determination of the judgmental assumption used in determining required company contribution into the plan due to differing objective and requirement between financial accounting rule and the pension plan funding regulation promulgated by governmental agency the actuarial method and assumption for the two purpose differ in certain important respect ultimately we will be required to fund all vested benefit under pension and postretirement benefit plan not funded by plan asset or investment return but the judgmental assumption used in the actuarial calculation significantly affect periodic financial statement and funding pattern over time projected benefit obligation are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligation by million benefit expense is sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan asset assumption basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by million while basis point decrease in the return on plan asset assumption would increase annual benefit expense by million in determining the discount rate we use yield on high quality fixed income investment matched to the estimated benefit cash flow of our plan we are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefit taken from pension plan during the year could exceed the total of service and interest component of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of portion of unrecognized net actuarial loss and gain these benefit payment are based on decision by plan participant and are therefore difficult to predict in the event there is significant reduction in the expected year of future service of present employee or the elimination of the accrual of defined benefit for some or all of their future service for significant number of employee we could recognize curtailment gain or loss see note employee benefit plan in the note to consolidated financial statement for additional information contingency number of claim and lawsuit

obligation for certain offshore property description of the matter at december the asset retirement obligation aro balance totaled billion further described in note the company record aros in the period in which they are incurred typically when the asset is installed at the production location the estimation of obligation related to certain offshore asset requires significant judgment given the magnitude of these removal cost and higher estimation uncertainty related to the removal plan and cost furthermore given certain of these asset are nearing the end of their operation the impact of change in these aros may result in material impact to earnings given the relatively short remaining useful life of the asset auditing the company aros for the obligation identified above is complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management in determining the obligation in particular the estimate were sensitive to significant subjective assumption such removal cost estimate and end of field life which are affected by expectation about future market or economic condition how we addressed the matter in our audit we obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the company internal control over it aro estimation process including management review of the significant assumption that have material effect on the determination of the obligation we also tested management control over the completeness and accuracy of the financial data used in the valuation to test the aros for the obligation identified above our audit procedure included among others assessing the significant assumption and input used in the valuation including removal cost estimate and end of field life assumption for example we evaluated removal cost estimate by comparing to settlement and recent removal activity and cost we also compared end of field life assumption to production forecast we involved our internal specialist in testing the underlying removal cost estimate depreciation depletion and amortization of proved oil and gas property description of the matter at december the net book value of the company property plant and equipment wa billion and depreciation depletion and amortization dd expense wa billion for the year then ended described in note dd of property plant and equipment on producing hydrocarbon property and certain pipeline and lng asset those which are expected to have declining utilization pattern are determined by the unit of production method based on proved oil and gas reserve estimated by the company internal reservoir engineer proved oil and gas reserve estimate are based on geological and engineering assessment of in place hydrocarbon volume the production plan historical extraction recovery and processing yield factor installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limit significant judgment is required by the company internal reservoir engineer in evaluating geological and engineering data when estimating proved oil and gas reserve estimating reserve also requires the selection of input including oil and gas price assumption future operating and capital cost assumption and tax rate by jurisdiction among others because of the complexity involved in estimating oil and gas reserve management also used third party petroleum engineering firm to perform review of the process and control used by the company internal reservoir engineer to determine estimate of proved oil and gas reserve auditing the company dd calculation is complex because of the use of the work of the internal reservoir engineer and third party petroleum engineering firm and the evaluation of management determination of the input described above used by the internal reservoir engineer in estimating proved oil and gas reserve how we addressed the matter in our audit we obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the company internal control over it process to calculate dd including management control over the completeness and accuracy of the financial data provided to the internal reservoir engineer for use in estimating proved oil and gas reserve our audit procedure included among others evaluating the professional qualification and objectivity of the company internal reservoir engineer primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserve estimate and the third party petroleum engineering firm used to review the company process and control in addition in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineer we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the financial data and input described above used by the internal reservoir engineer in estimating proved oil and gas reserve by agreeing them to source documentation and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence for proved undeveloped reserve we evaluated management development plan for compliance with the sec rule that undrilled location are scheduled to be drilled within five year unless specific circumstance justify longer time by assessing consistency of the development projection with the company drill plan we also tested the accuracy of the dd calculation including comparing the proved oil and gas reserve amount used in the calculation to the company reserve report

differ from these estimate revenue recognition revenue associated with the sale of crude oil bitumen natural gas lng ngls and other item are recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the asset in evaluating when customer ha control of the asset we primarily consider whether the transfer of legal title and physical delivery ha occurred whether the customer ha significant risk and reward of ownership and whether the customer ha accepted delivery and right to payment exists these product are typically sold at prevailing market price we allocate variable market based consideration to delivery performance obligation in the current period that consideration relates specifically to our effort to transfer control of current period delivery to the customer and represents the amount we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the related product payment is typically due within day or le revenue associated with transaction commonly called buy sell contract in which the purchase and sale of inventory with the same counterparty are entered into in contemplation of one another are combined and reported net on the same income statement line shipping and handling cost we typically incur shipping and handling cost prior to control transferring to the customer and account for these activity fulfillment cost accordingly we include shipping and handling

consistently use the following method for each type of inventory the majority of our commodity related inventory are recorded at cost using the lifo basis we measure these inventory at the lower of cost or market in the aggregate any necessary lower of cost or market write down at year end are recorded permanent adjustment to the lifo cost basis lifo is used to better match current inventory cost with current revenue cost include both direct and indirect expenditure incurred in bringing an item or product to it existing condition and location but not unusual nonrecurring cost or research and development cost material supply and other miscellaneous inventory such tubular good and well equipment are valued using various method including the weighted average cost method and the fifo method consistent with industry practice fair value measurement asset and liability measured at fair value and required to be categorized within the fair value hierarchy are categorized into one of three different level depending on the observability of the input employed in the measurement level input are quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level input are observable input other than quoted price included within level for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly through market corroborated input level input are unobservable input for the asset or liability reflecting significant modification to observable related market data or our assumption about pricing by market participant derivative instrument derivative instrument are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value if the right of offset exists and certain other criterion are met derivative asset and liability with the same counterparty are netted on the balance sheet and the collateral payable or receivable is netted against derivative asset and derivative liability respectively recognition and classification of the gain or loss that result from recording and adjusting derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative gain and loss from derivative not accounted for hedge are recognized immediately in earnings oil and gas exploration and development oil and gas exploration and development cost are accounted for using the successful effort method of accounting property acquisition cost oil and gas leasehold acquisition cost are capitalized and included in the balance sheet caption pp leasehold impairment is recognized based on exploratory experience and management judgment upon achievement of all condition necessary for reserve to be classified proved the associated leasehold cost are reclassified to proved property exploratory cost geological and geophysical cost and the cost of carrying and retaining undeveloped property are expensed incurred exploratory well cost are capitalized or suspended on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserve have been found if economically recoverable reserve are not found exploratory well cost are expensed dry hole if exploratory well encounter potentially economic quantity of oil and gas the well cost remain capitalized on the balance sheet long sufficient progress assessing the reserve and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made for complex exploratory discovery it is not unusual to have exploratory well remain suspended on the balance sheet for several year while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co venturer approval of development plan or seek environmental permitting once all required approval and permit have been obtained the project are moved into the development phase and the oil and gas resource are designated proved reserve management review suspended well balance quarterly continuously monitor the result of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work and expense the suspended well cost dry hole when it judge the potential field doe not warrant further investment in the near term see note suspended well and other exploration expense for additional information on suspended well development cost cost incurred to drill and equip development well including unsuccessful development well are capitalized depletion and amortization leasehold cost of producing property are depleted using the unit of production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserve amortization of intangible development cost is based on the unit of production method using estimated proved developed oil and gas reserve capitalized interest interest from external borrowing is capitalized on major project with an expected construction period of one year or longer capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying asset and is amortized over the useful life of the asset in the same manner the underlying asset depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization of pp on producing hydrocarbon property and certain pipeline and lng asset those which are expected to have declining utilization pattern are determined by the unit of production method depreciation and amortization of all other pp are determined by either the individual unit straight line method or the group straight line method for those individual unit that are highly integrated with other unit impairment of property plant and equipment pp used in operation are assessed for impairment whenever change in fact and circumstance indicate possible significant deterioration in the future cash flow expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following update to corporate planning assumption if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered the asset is monitored by management through an established process where change to significant assumption such price volume and future development plan are reviewed if upon review the sum of the undiscounted before tax cash flow is le than the carrying value of the asset group the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value through additional amortization or depreciation provision and reported impairment in the period in which the determination of the impairment is made individual asset are grouped for impairment purpose at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flow that are largely independent of the cash flow of other group of asset generally on field by field basis for asset because there usually is lack of quoted market price for long lived asset the fair value of impaired asset is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flow using discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participant or based on multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transaction of similar asset where possible long lived asset committed by management for disposal within one year are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value le cost to sell with fair value determined using binding negotiated price if available or present value of expected future cash flow previously described the expected future cash flow used for impairment review and related fair value calculation are based on estimated future production volume price and cost considering all available evidence at the date of review the impairment review includes cash flow from proved developed and undeveloped reserve including any development expenditure necessary to achieve that production additionally when probable and possible reserve exist an appropriate risk adjusted amount of these reserve may be included in the impairment calculation impairment of investment in nonconsolidated entity investment in nonconsolidated entity are assessed for impairment whenever change in the fact and circumstance indicate loss in

significantly alter the dd rate the difference between asset cost and salvage value is charged or credited to accumulated depreciation asset retirement obligation and environmental cost the fair value of legal obligation to retire and remove long lived asset are recorded in the period in which the obligation is incurred typically when the asset is installed at the production location when the liability is initially recorded we capitalize this cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related pp if in subsequent period our estimate of this liability change we will record an adjustment to both the liability and pp over time the liability is increased for the change in it present value and the capitalized cost in pp is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset reduction to estimated liability for asset that are no longer producing are recorded credit to impairment if the asset had been previously impaired or credit to dd if the asset had not been previously impaired

expenditure relating to an existing condition caused by past operation and those having no future economic benefit are expensed liability for environmental expenditure are recorded on an undiscounted basis unless acquired in purchase business combination which we record on discounted basis when environmental assessment or cleanup are probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated recovery of environmental remediation cost from other party are recorded asset when their receipt is probable and estimable guarantee the fair value of guarantee is determined and recorded liability at the time the guarantee is given the initial liability is subsequently reduced we are released from exposure under the guarantee we amortize the guarantee liability over the relevant time period if one exists based on the fact and circumstance surrounding each type of guarantee in case where the guarantee term is indefinite we reverse the liability when we have information indicating the liability is essentially relieved or amortize it over an appropriate time period the fair value of our guarantee exposure decline over time we amortize the guarantee liability to the related income statement line item based on the nature of the guarantee when it becomes probable that we will have to perform on guarantee we accrue separate liability if it is reasonably estimable based on the fact and circumstance at that time we reverse the fair value liability only when there is no further exposure under the guarantee share based compensation we recognize share based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period the stated period of time required to earn the award or the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for

connection with our percent ownership interest in aplng the following is description of the guarantee with value calculated utilizing december exchange rate during the third quarter of we issued guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro rata portion of the fund in project finance reserve account we estimate the remaining term of this guarantee is year our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lender against aplng at december the carrying value of this guarantee is approximately million in conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in aplng from origin energy in october we agreed to reimburse origin energy for our share of the existing

for future payment or cost of volume delivery under these guarantee is estimated to be million billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach and would become payable if aplng fails to meet it obligation under these agreement and the obligation can not otherwise be mitigated future payment are considered unlikely the payment or cost of volume delivery would only be triggered if aplng doe not have enough natural gas to meet these sale commitment and if the co venturer do not make necessary equity contribution into aplng we have guaranteed the performance of aplng with regard to certain

letter of credit which were provided for the benefit of entity that are now affiliate of chrysaor limited our maximum potential payment exposure under these obligation is approximately million chrysaor limited ha agreed to fully indemnify conocophillips for any loss suffered by related to these obligation indemnification over the year we have entered into agreement to sell ownership interest in certain corporation joint venture and asset that gave rise to qualifying indemnification these agreement include indemnification for tax environmental liability employee claim and litigation the term of these indemnification vary greatly the majority of these indemnification are related to environmental issue the term is generally indefinite and the maximum amount of future payment is generally unlimited the carrying amount recorded for these indemnification at december wa approximately million we amortize the indemnification liability over the relevant time period if one exists based on the fact and circumstance surrounding each type of indemnity in case where the indemnification term is indefinite we will reverse the liability when we have information the liability is essentially relieved or amortize the liability over an appropriate time period the fair value of our indemnification exposure decline although it is reasonably possible future payment may exceed amount recorded due to the nature of the indemnification it is not possible to make reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payment included in the recorded carrying amount at december were approximately million of environmental accrual for known contamination that are included in the asset retirement obligation and accrued environmental cost line on our consolidated balance sheet for additional information about environmental liability see note contingency and commitment note contingency and commitment number of lawsuit involving variety of claim arising in the ordinary course of business have been filed against conocophillips we also may be required to remove or mitigate the effect on the environment of the placement storage disposal or release of certain chemical mineral and petroleum substance at various active and inactive site we regularly ass the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingency in the case of all known contingency other than those related to income tax we accrue liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if range of amount can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is better estimate than any other amount then the minimum of the range is accrued we do not reduce these liability for potential insurance or third party recovery if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recovery with respect to income tax related contingency we use cumulative probability weighted loss accrual in case where sustaining tax position is le than certain see note income tax for additional information about income tax related contingency based on currently available information we believe it is remote that future cost related to known contingent liability exposure will exceed current accrual by an amount that would have material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statement we learn new fact concerning contingency we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liability and other potential exposure estimate particularly sensitive to future change include contingent liability recorded for environmental remediation tax and legal matter estimated future environmental remediation cost are subject to change due to such factor the uncertain magnitude of cleanup cost the unknown time and extent of such remedial action that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible party estimated future cost related to tax and legal matter are subject to change event evolve and additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation process environmental we are subject to international federal state and local environmental law and regulation when we prepare our consolidated financial statement we record accrual for environmental liability based on management best estimate using all information that is available at the time we measure estimate and base liability on currently available fact existing technology and presently enacted law and regulation taking into account stakeholder and business consideration when measuring environmental liability we also consider our prior experience in remediation of contaminated site other company cleanup experience and data released by the epa or other organization we consider unasserted claim in our determination of environmental liability and we accrue them in the period they are both probable and reasonably estimable although liability of those potentially responsible for environmental remediation cost is generally joint and several for federal site and frequently so for other site we are usually only one of many company cited at particular site due to the joint and several liability we could be responsible for all cleanup cost related to any site at which we have been designated potentially responsible party we have been successful to date in sharing cleanup cost with other financially sound company many of the site at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the agency concerned prior to actual cleanup those potentially responsible normally ass the site condition apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation in some instance we may have no liability or may attain settlement of liability where it appears that other potentially responsible party may be financially unable to bear their proportional share we consider this inability in estimating our potential liability and we adjust our accrual accordingly result of various acquisition in the past we assumed certain environmental obligation some of these environmental obligation are mitigated by indemnification made by others for our benefit and some of the indemnification are subject to dollar limit and time limit we are currently participating in environmental assessment and cleanup at numerous federal superfund and comparable state and international site after an assessment of environmental exposure for cleanup and other cost we make accrual on an undiscounted basis except those acquired in purchase business combination which we record on discounted basis for planned investigation and remediation activity for site where it is probable future cost will be incurred and these cost can be reasonably estimated we have not reduced these accrual for possible insurance recovery in the future we may be involved in additional environmental assessment cleanup and proceeding see note asset retirement obligation and accrued environmental cost for summary of our accrued environmental liability legal proceeding we are subject to various lawsuit and claim including but not limited to matter involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payment gas measurement and valuation method contract dispute environmental damage climate change personal injury and property damage

generally the plan investment are publicly traded therefore minimizing liquidity risk in the portfolio the following is description of the valuation methodology used for the pension plan asset there have been no change in the methodology used at december and fair value of equity security and government debt security categorized in level are primarily based on quoted market price in active market for identical asset and liability fair value of corporate debt security agency and mortgage backed security and government debt security categorized in level are estimated using recently executed transaction and quoted market price for similar asset and liability in active market and for identical asset and liability in market that are not active if there have been no market transaction in particular fixed income security it fair value is calculated by pricing model that benchmark the security against other security with actual market price when observable quoted market price are not available fair value is based on pricing model that use something other than actual market price observable input such benchmark yield reported trade and issuer spread for similar security and these security are categorized in level of the fair value hierarchy fair value of investment in common collective trust are determined by the issuer of each fund based on the fair value of the underlying asset fair value of mutual fund are based on quoted market price which represent the net asset value of share held time deposit are valued at cost which approximates fair value cash is valued at cost which approximates fair value fair value of international cash equivalent categorized in level are valued using observable yield curve discounting and interest rate cash balance held in the form of short term fund unit that are redeemable at the measurement date are categorized level fair value of exchange traded derivative classified in level are based on quoted market price for other derivative classified in level the value are generally calculated from pricing model with market input parameter from third party source fair value of insurance contract are valued at the present value of the future benefit payment owed by the insurance company to the plan participant fair value of real estate investment are valued using real estate valuation technique and other method that include reference to third party source and sale comparables where available portion of pension plan asset is held participating interest in an insurance annuity contract which is calculated the market value of investment held under this contract le the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract the participating interest is classified level in the fair value hierarchy the fair

guideline the estimated future date when an asset will be permanently shut down for economic reason is based on historical month first of month average price and current cost this estimated date when production will end affect the amount of estimated reserve therefore price and cost level change from year to year the estimate of proved reserve also change generally our proved reserve decrease price decline and increase price rise our proved reserve include estimated quantity related to pscs which are reported under the economic interest method well variable royalty regime and are subject to fluctuation in commodity price recoverable operating expense and capital cost if cost remain stable reserve quantity attributable to recovery of cost will change inversely to change in commodity price for example if price increase then our applicable reserve quantity would decline at december approximately percent of our total proved reserve were under pscs located in our asia pacific middle east geographic reporting area and percent of our total proved reserve were under variable royalty regime located in our canada geographic reporting area reserve governance the recording and reporting of proved reserve are governed by criterion established by regulation of the sec and fasb proved reserve are those quantity of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from given date forward from known reservoir and under existing economic condition operating method and government regulation prior to the time at which contract providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic method are used for the estimation the project to extract the hydrocarbon must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain it will commence the project within reasonable time proved reserve are further classified either developed or undeveloped proved developed reserve are proved reserve that can be expected to be recovered through existing well with existing equipment and operating method or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of new well and through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserve estimate if the extraction is by mean not involving well proved undeveloped reserve are proved reserve expected to be recovered from new well on undrilled acreage or from existing well where relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion reserve on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing area that are reasonably certain of production when drilled unless evidence provided by reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distance defined by sec regulation reliable technology may be used in reserve estimation when they have been demonstrated in the field to provide reasonably certain result with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation the technology and data used in the estimation of our proved reserve include but are not limited to performance based method volumetric based method geologic map seismic interpretation well log well test data core data analogy and statistical analysis we have companywide comprehensive sec compliant internal policy that governs the determination and reporting of proved reserve this policy is applied by the geoscientists and reservoir engineer in our business unit around the world part of our internal control process each business unit reserve process and control are reviewed annually by an internal team which is headed by the company manager of reserve compliance and reporting this team composed of internal reservoir engineer geoscientists finance personnel and senior representative from degolyer and macnaughton third party petroleum engineering consulting firm review the business unit reserve for adherence to sec guideline and company policy through on site visit teleconference and review of documentation in addition to providing independent review this internal team also ensures reserve are calculated using consistent and appropriate standard and procedure this team is independent of business unit line management and is responsible for reporting it finding to senior management the team is responsible for communicating our reserve policy and procedure and is available for internal peer review and consultation on major project or technical issue throughout the year all of our proved reserve held by consolidated company and our share of equity affiliate have been estimated by conocophillips during our process and control used to ass over percent of proved reserve of december were reviewed by the purpose of their review wa to ass whether the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal process and control used to determine estimate of proved reserve are in accordance with sec regulation in such review conocophillips technical staff presented with an overview of the reserve data well the method and assumption used in estimating reserve the data presented included pertinent seismic information geologic map well log production test
