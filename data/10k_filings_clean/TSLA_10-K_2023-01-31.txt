motor vehicle safety standard fmvss and the nhtsa bumper standard numerous fmvss apply to our vehicle such crash worthiness and occupant protection requirement our current vehicle fully comply and we expect that our vehicle in the future will fully comply with all applicable fmvss with limited or no exemption however fmvss are subject to change from time to time manufacturer we must self certify that our vehicle meet all applicable fmvss and the nhtsa bumper standard or otherwise are exempt the vehicle may be imported or sold in the we are also required to comply with other federal law administered by nhtsa including the corporate average fuel economy standard theft prevention act requirement labeling requirement and other information provided to customer in writing early warning reporting requirement regarding warranty claim field report death and injury report and foreign recall standing general order requiring report regarding crash involving vehicle equipped with advanced driver assistance system and additional requirement for cooperating with compliance and safety investigation and recall reporting the automobile information and disclosure act also requires manufacturer of motor vehicle to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer suggested retail price optional equipment and pricing in addition federal law requires inclusion of fuel economy rating determined by the department of transportation and the environmental protection agency the epa and new car assessment program rating determined by nhtsa if available our vehicle sold outside of the are subject to similar foreign compliance safety environmental and other regulation many of those regulation are different from those applicable in the and may require redesign and or retesting some of those regulation impact or prevent the rollout of new vehicle feature additionally the european union established new rule regarding additional compliance oversight that commenced in self driving vehicle generally law pertaining to self driving vehicle are evolving globally and in some case may create restriction on feature that we develop while there are currently no federal regulation pertaining specifically to self driving vehicle or self driving equipment nhtsa ha published recommended guideline on self driving vehicle apart from the fmvss and manufacturer reporting obligation and retains the authority to investigate and or take action on the safety or compliance of any vehicle equipment or feature operating on public road certain state also have legal restriction on the operation registration or licensure of self driving vehicle and many other state are considering them this regulatory patchwork increase the legal complexity with respect to self driving vehicle in the in market that follow the regulation of the united nation economic commission for europe some requirement restrict the design of advanced driver assistance or self driving feature which can compromise or prevent their use entirely other applicable law both current and proposed may hinder the path and timeline to introducing self driving vehicle for sale and use in the market where they apply other key market including china continue to consider self driving regulation any implemented regulation may differ materially from those in the and europe which may further increase the legal complexity of self driving vehicle and limit or prevent certain feature automobile manufacturer and dealer regulation in the state law regulate the manufacture distribution sale and service of automobile and generally require motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer to be licensed in order to sell vehicle directly to resident certain state have asserted that the law in such state do not permit automobile manufacturer to be licensed dealer or to act in the capacity of dealer or that they otherwise restrict manufacturer ability to deliver or perform warranty repair on vehicle to sell vehicle to resident of state where we are not licensed dealer we generally conduct the sale out of the state in certain such state we have opened gallery that serve an educational purpose and where sale may not occur some automobile dealer trade association have both challenged the legality of our operation in court and used administrative and legislative process to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing store or expand to new location certain dealer association have also actively lobbied state licensing agency and legislator to interpret existing law or enact new law in way not favorable to our ownership and operation of our own retail and service location we expect such challenge to continue and we intend to actively fight any such effort battery safety and testing our battery pack are subject to various and international regulation that govern transport of dangerous good defined to include lithium ion battery which may present risk in transportation we conduct testing to demonstrate our compliance with such regulation we use lithium ion cell in our high voltage battery pack in our vehicle and energy storage product the use storage and disposal of our battery pack are regulated under existing law and are the subject of ongoing regulatory change that may add additional requirement in the future we have agreement with third party battery recycling company to recycle our battery pack and we are also piloting our own recycling technology solar energy general we are subject to certain state and federal regulation applicable to solar and battery storage provider and seller of electricity to operate our system we enter into standard interconnection agreement with applicable utility sale of electricity and non sale equipment lease by third party such our lease and ppas have faced regulatory challenge in some state and jurisdiction solar energy net metering most state in the make net energy metering or net metering available to solar customer net metering typically allows solar customer to interconnect their solar energy system to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchase by receiving bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid in certain jurisdiction regulator or utility have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so competition automotive the worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future we introduce additional vehicle in broader cross section of the passenger and commercial vehicle market and expand our vehicle capability we believe that our vehicle compete in the market based on both their traditional segment classification well their propulsion technology for example model and model compete primarily with premium sedan and premium suv and model and model compete with small to medium sized sedan and compact suv which are extremely competitive market competing product typically include internal combustion vehicle from more established automobile manufacturer however many established and new automobile manufacturer have entered or have announced plan to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicle overall we believe these announcement and vehicle introduction including the introduction of electric vehicle into rental car company fleet promote the development of the electric vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of electric vehicle relative to the internal combustion vehicle many major automobile manufacturer have electric vehicle available today in major market including the china and europe and other current and prospective automobile manufacturer are also developing electric vehicle in addition several manufacturer offer hybrid vehicle including plug in version we believe that there is also increasing competition for our vehicle offering platform for delivering self driving technology charging solution and other feature and service and we expect to compete in this developing market through continued progress on our autopilot fsd and neural network capability supercharger network and our infotainment offering energy generation and storage energy storage system the market for energy storage product is also highly competitive and both established and emerging company have introduced product that are similar to our product portfolio or that are alternative to the element of our system we compete with these company based on price energy density and efficiency we believe that the specification and feature of our product our strong brand and the modular scalable nature of our energy storage product give competitive advantage in our market solar energy system the primary competitor to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility company that supply energy to our potential customer we compete with these traditional utility company primarily based on price and the ease by which customer can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy system we also compete with solar energy company that provide product and service similar to many solar energy company only install solar energy system while others only provide financing for these installation we believe we have significant expansion opportunity with our offering and that the regulatory environment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy system intellectual property we place strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary design which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio part of our business we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property right of these innovation and design such with respect to patent trademark copyright trade secret and other measure including through employee and third party nondisclosure agreement and other contractual arrangement for example we place high priority on obtaining patent to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovation and design within our product and technology in the electric vehicle market well to protect and defend our product portfolio we have also adopted patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate lawsuit against any party for infringing our patent through activity relating to electric vehicle or related equipment for so long such party is acting in good faith we made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of common rapidly evolving platform for electric vehicle thereby benefiting ourselves other company making electric vehicle and the world environmental social and governance

report on form item risk factor you should carefully consider the risk described below together with the other information set forth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future result the risk described below are not the only risk facing our company risk and uncertainty not currently known to or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result risk related to our ability to grow our business we may be impacted by macroeconomic condition resulting from the global covid pandemic since the first quarter of there ha been worldwide impact from the covid pandemic government regulation and shifting social behavior have at time limited or closed non essential transportation government function business activity and person to person interaction global trade condition and consumer trend that originated during the pandemic continue to persist and may also have long lasting adverse impact on and our industry independently of the progress of the pandemic for example pandemic related issue have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdown and delay resulting in additional expense to expedite delivery of critical part similarly increased demand for personal electronics ha created shortfall of semiconductor which ha caused challenge in our supply chain and production in addition labor shortage resulting from the pandemic including worker absenteeism ha led to increased difficulty in hiring and retaining manufacturing and service worker well increased labor cost and supplier delay sustaining our production trajectory will require the ongoing readiness and solvency of our supplier and vendor stable and motivated production workforce and government cooperation including for travel and visa allowance the contingency inherent in the ramp at new facility such gigafactory berlin brandenburg and gigafactory texas may be exacerbated by these challenge additionally infection rate and regulation continue to fluctuate in various region which may impact operation for example in spike in covid case in shanghai resulted in the temporary shutdown of gigafactory shanghai well part of our supply chain and impacted our ability to deliver car we can not predict the duration or direction of current global trend or their sustained impact ultimately we continue to monitor macroeconomic condition to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business appropriate and attempt to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirement globally and deploy our production workforce and other resource accordingly lastly rising interest rate may lead to consumer to increasingly pull back spending including on our product which may harm our demand business and operating result if we experience unfavorable global market condition or if we can not or do not maintain operation at scope that is commensurate with such condition or are later required to or choose to suspend such operation our business prospect financial condition and operating result may be harmed we may experience delay in launching and ramping the production of our product and feature or we may be unable to control our manufacturing cost we have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp delay for new product and feature for example we encountered unanticipated supplier issue that led to delay during the initial ramp of our first model and experienced challenge with supplier and with ramping full automation for certain of our initial model manufacturing process in addition we may introduce in the future new or unique manufacturing process and design feature for our product there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale such process or feature in particular our future business depends in large part on increasing the production of mass market vehicle including model and model in order to be successful we will need to implement maintain and ramp efficient and cost effective manufacturing capability process and supply chain and achieve the design tolerance high quality and output rate we have planned at our manufacturing facility in california nevada texas china germany and any future site we will also need to hire train and compensate skilled employee to operate these facility bottleneck and other unexpected challenge such those we experienced in the past may arise during our production ramp and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing process and reducing cost if we are not successful in achieving these goal we could face delay in establishing and or sustaining our model and model ramp or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability target we have experienced and may also experience similar future delay in launching and or ramping production of our energy storage product and solar roof new product version or variant new vehicle and future feature and service based on artificial intelligence likewise we may encounter delay with the design construction and regulatory or other approval necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing facility and product any delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current product or the development manufacture launch and production ramp of our future product feature and service or in so cost effectively and with high quality may harm our brand business prospect financial condition and operating result our supplier may fail to deliver component according to schedule price quality and volume that are acceptable to or we may be unable to manage these component effectively our product contain thousand of part purchased globally from hundred of supplier including single source direct supplier which expose to multiple potential source of component shortage unexpected change in business condition material pricing including inflation of raw material cost labor issue war trade policy natural disaster health epidemic such the global covid pandemic trade and shipping disruption port congestion and other factor beyond our or our supplier control could also affect these supplier ability to deliver component to or to remain solvent and operational for example global shortage of semiconductor ha been reported since early and ha caused challenge in the manufacturing industry and impacted our supply chain and production in addition spike in covid case in shanghai in early led to temporary manufacturing shutdown of certain of our supplier we have used alternative part and programmed software to mitigate certain challenge caused by these shortage but there is no guarantee we may be able to continually do so we scale production to meet our growth target additionally if our supplier do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if they are not willing to allocate sufficient production to it may reduce our access to component and require to search for new supplier the unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delay idle manufacturing facility product design change and loss of access to important technology and tool for producing and supporting our product well impact our capacity expansion and our ability to fulfill our obligation under customer contract moreover significant increase in our production such for model and model or product design change by have required and may in the future require to procure additional component in short amount of time we have faced in the past and may face supplier who are unwilling or unable to sustainably meet our timeline or our cost quality and volume need or to do so may cost more which may require to replace them with other source finally we have limited vehicle manufacturing experience outside of the fremont factory and gigafactory shanghai and we may experience issue increasing the level of localized procurement at gigafactory berlin brandenburg and gigafactory texas while we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate source or develop our own replacement for most of our component there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all additionally we may be unsuccessful in our continuous effort to negotiate with existing supplier to obtain cost reduction and avoid unfavorable change to term source le expensive supplier for certain part and redesign certain part to make them le expensive to produce especially in light of the increase in material pricing any of these occurrence may harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result the scale of our vehicle production increase we will also need to accurately forecast purchase warehouse and transport component at high volume to our manufacturing facility and servicing location internationally if we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantity of component purchase to our actual need or successfully implement automation inventory management and other system to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain and part management we may incur unexpected production disruption storage transportation and write off cost which may harm our business and operating result we may be unable to meet our projected construction timeline cost and production ramp at new factory or we may experience difficulty in generating and maintaining demand for product manufactured there our ability to increase production of our vehicle on sustained basis make them affordable globally by accessing local supply chain and workforce and streamline delivery logistics is dependent on the construction and ramp of our current and future factory the construction of and commencement and ramp of production at these factory are subject to number of uncertainty inherent in all new manufacturing operation including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirement procurement and maintenance of construction environmental and operational license and approval for additional expansion supply chain constraint hiring training and retention of qualified employee and the pace of bringing production equipment and process online with the capability to manufacture high quality unit at scale moreover we will have to establish and ramp production of our proprietary battery cell and pack at our new factory and we additionally intend to incorporate sequential design and manufacturing change into vehicle manufactured at each new factory if we experience any issue or delay in meeting our projected timeline cost capital efficiency and production capacity for our new factory expanding and managing team to implement iterative design and production change there maintaining and complying with the term of any debt financing that we obtain to fund them or generating and maintaining demand for the vehicle we manufacture there our business prospect operating result and financial condition may be harmed we may be unable to grow our global product sale delivery and installation capability and our servicing and vehicle charging network or we may be unable to accurately project and effectively manage our growth our success will depend on our ability to continue to expand our sale capability we are targeting with model and model global mass demographic with broad range of potential customer in which we have relatively limited experience projecting demand and pricing our product we currently produce numerous international variant at limited number of factory and if our specific demand expectation for these variant prove inaccurate we may not be able to timely generate delivery matched to the vehicle that we produce in the same timeframe or that are commensurate with the size of our operation in given region likewise we develop and grow our energy product and service worldwide our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecast demand in various market we do not have independent dealer network we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicle to our customer our production volume continue to grow we have faced in the past and may face challenge with delivery at increasing volume particularly in international market requiring significant transit time we have also deployed number of delivery model such delivery to customer home and workplace and touchless delivery but there is no guarantee that such model will be scalable or be accepted globally likewise we ramp our energy product we are working to substantially increase our production and installation capability if we experience production delay or inaccurately forecast demand our business financial condition and operating result may be harmed moreover because of our unique expertise with our vehicle we recommend that our vehicle be serviced by or by certain authorized professional if we experience delay in adding servicing capacity or servicing our vehicle efficiently or experience unforeseen issue with the reliability of our vehicle particularly higher volume addition to our fleet such model and model it could overburden our servicing capability and part inventory similarly the increasing number of tesla vehicle also requires to continue to rapidly increase the number of our supercharger station and connector throughout the world there is no assurance that we will be able to ramp our business to meet our sale delivery installation servicing and vehicle charging target globally that our projection on which such target are based will prove accurate or that the pace of growth or coverage of our customer infrastructure network will meet customer expectation these plan require significant cash investment and management resource and there is no guarantee that they will generate additional sale or installation of our product or that we will be able to avoid cost overrun or be able to hire additional personnel to support them we expand we will also need to ensure our compliance with regulatory requirement in various jurisdiction applicable to the sale installation and servicing of our product the sale or dispatch of electricity related to our energy product and the operation of supercharger if we fail to manage our growth effectively it may harm our brand business prospect financial condition and operating result we will need to maintain and significantly grow our access to battery cell including through the development and manufacture of our own cell and control our related cost we are dependent on the continued supply of lithium ion battery cell for our vehicle and energy storage product and we will require substantially more cell to grow our business according to our plan currently we rely on supplier such panasonic and contemporary amperex technology co limited catl for these cell we have to date fully qualified only very limited number of such supplier and have limited flexibility in changing supplier any disruption in the supply of battery cell from our supplier could limit production of our vehicle and energy storage product in the long term we intend to supplement cell from our supplier with cell manufactured by which we believe will be more efficient manufacturable at greater volume and more cost effective than currently available cell however our effort to develop and manufacture such battery cell have required and may continue to require significant investment and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these target in the timeframes that we have planned or at all if we are unable to do so we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy storage product production or procure additional cell from supplier at potentially greater cost either of which may harm our business and operating result in addition the cost and mass production of battery cell whether manufactured by our supplier or by depends in part upon the price and availability of raw material such lithium nickel cobalt and or other metal the price for these material fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable depending on market condition and global demand for these material for example result of increased global production of electric vehicle and energy storage product supplier of these raw material may be unable to meet our volume need additionally our supplier may not be willing or able to reliably meet our timeline or our cost and quality need which may require to replace them with other source any reduced availability of these material may impact our access to cell and our growth and any increase in their price may reduce our profitability if we can not recoup such cost through increased price moreover our inability to meet demand and any product price increase may harm our brand growth prospect and operating result our future growth and success are dependent upon consumer demand for electric vehicle and specifically our vehicle in an automotive industry that is generally competitive cyclical and volatile though we continue to see increased interest and adoption of electric vehicle if the market for electric vehicle in general and tesla vehicle in particular doe not develop we expect develops more slowly than we expect or if demand for our vehicle decrease in our market or our vehicle compete with each other our business prospect financial condition and operating result may be harmed in addition electric vehicle still constitute small percentage of overall vehicle sale result the market for our vehicle could be negatively affected by numerous factor such perception about electric vehicle feature quality safety performance and cost perception about the limited range over which electric vehicle may be driven on single battery charge and access to charging facility competition including from other type of alternative fuel vehicle plug in hybrid electric vehicle and high fuel economy internal combustion engine vehicle volatility in the cost of oil gasoline and energy such wide fluctuation in crude oil price during government regulation and economic incentive and condition and concern about our future viability finally the target demographic for our vehicle particularly model and model are highly competitive sale of vehicle in the automotive industry tend to be cyclical in many market which may expose to further volatility we face strong competition for our product and service from growing list of established and new competitor the worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future for example model and model face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturer in the extremely competitive entry level premium sedan and compact suv market significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturer well other company have entered or are reported to have plan to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicle including hybrid plug in hybrid and fully electric vehicle well the market for self driving technology and other vehicle application and software platform in some case our competitor offer or will offer electric vehicle in important market such china and europe and or have announced an intention to produce electric vehicle exclusively at some point in the future many of our competitor have significantly more or better established resource than we do to devote to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their product increased competition could result in our lower vehicle unit sale price reduction revenue shortfall loss of customer and loss of market share which may harm our business financial condition and operating result we also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturer developer installers and service provider of competing energy technology well from large utility decrease in the retail or wholesale price of electricity from utility or other renewable energy source could make our product le attractive to customer and lead to an increased rate of customer default risk related to our operation we may experience issue with lithium ion cell or other component manufactured at our gigafactories which may harm the production and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage product our plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage product depends on significant lithium ion battery cell production including by our partner panasonic at gigafactory nevada we also produce several vehicle component at our gigafactories such battery module and pack and drive unit and manufacture energy storage product in the past some of the manufacturing line for certain product component took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity and additional bottleneck may arise in the future we continue to increase the production rate and introduce new line in addition the ira provides new incentive for domestic energy production and manufacturing we may face increasing competition from other automobile manufacturer well supplier for the resource and capacity to build additional factory and expand our operation domestically if we are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operation or if we are unable to do so cost effectively or hire and retain highly skilled personnel there our ability to manufacture our product profitably would be limited which may harm our business and operating result finally the high volume of lithium ion cell and battery module and pack manufactured by and by our supplier are stored and recycled at our various facility any mishandling of these product may cause disruption to the operation of such facility while we have implemented safety procedure related to the handling of the cell there can be no assurance that safety issue or fire related to the cell would not disrupt our operation any such disruption or issue may harm our brand and business we face risk associated with maintaining and expanding our international operation including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory political economic tax and labor condition we are subject to legal and regulatory requirement political uncertainty and social environmental and economic condition in numerous jurisdiction including market in which we generate significant sale over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable our operation in such jurisdiction particularly company based in the create risk relating to conforming our product to regulatory and safety requirement and charging and other electric infrastructure organizing local operating entity establishing staffing and managing foreign business location attracting local customer navigating foreign government tax regulation and permit requirement enforceability of our contractual right trade restriction custom regulation tariff and price or exchange control and preference in foreign nation for domestically manufactured product such condition may increase our cost impact our ability to sell our product and require significant management attention and may harm our business if we are unable to manage them effectively our business may suffer if our product or feature contain defect fail to perform expected or take longer than expected to become fully functional if our product contain design or manufacturing defect that cause them not to perform expected or that require repair or certain feature of our vehicle such new autopilot or fsd feature take longer than expected to become enabled are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation our ability to develop market and sell our product and service may be harmed and we may experience delivery delay product recall product liability breach of warranty and consumer protection claim and significant warranty and other expense there is no guarantee that any incremental change in the specific equipment we deploy in our vehicle over time will not result in initial functional disparity from prior iteration or will perform expected in the timeframe we anticipate or at all our product are also highly dependent on software which is inherently complex and may contain latent defect or error or be subject to external attack issue experienced by our customer have included those related to taillight seat belt chime and display screen in certain tesla model although we attempt to remedy any issue we observe in our product effectively and rapidly possible such effort may not be timely may hamper production or may not completely satisfy our customer while we have performed and continue to perform extensive internal testing on our product and feature we currently have limited frame of reference by which to evaluate their long term quality reliability durability and performance characteristic there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defect in our product prior to their sale to or installation for customer we may be required to defend or insure against product liability claim the automobile industry generally experience significant product liability claim and such we face the risk of such claim in the event our vehicle do not perform or are claimed to not have performed expected is true for other automaker our vehicle have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in accident resulting in death or personal injury and such accident where autopilot enhanced autopilot or fsd capability feature are engaged are the subject of significant public attention especially in light of nhtsa standing general order requiring report regarding crash involving vehicle with advanced driver assistance system we have experienced and we expect to continue to face claim and regulatory scrutiny arising from or related to misuse or claimed failure or alleged misrepresentation of such new technology that we are pioneering in addition the battery pack that we produce make use of lithium ion cell on rare occasion lithium ion cell can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flame in manner that can ignite nearby material well other lithium ion cell while we have designed our battery pack to passively contain any single cell release of energy without spreading to neighboring cell there can be no assurance that field or testing failure of our vehicle or other battery pack that we produce will not occur in particular due to high speed crash likewise our solar energy system and energy storage product generate and store electricity they have the potential to fail or cause injury to people or property any product liability claim may subject to lawsuit and substantial monetary damage product recall or redesign effort and even meritless claim may require to defend it all of which may generate negative publicity and be expensive and time consuming in most jurisdiction we generally self insure against the risk of product liability claim for vehicle exposure meaning that any product liability claim will likely have to be paid from company fund and not by insurance we will need to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long term business prospect in order to succeed in order to maintain and grow our business we must maintain credibility and confidence among customer supplier analyst investor rating agency and other party in our long term financial viability and business prospect maintaining such confidence may be challenging due to our limited operating history relative to established competitor customer unfamiliarity with our product any delay we may experience in scaling manufacturing delivery and service operation to meet demand competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicle or our other product and service our quarterly production and sale performance compared with market expectation and other factor including those over which we have no control in particular tesla product business result of operation and statement and action of tesla and it management are well publicized by range of third party such attention can include criticism which may be exaggerated or unfounded such speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team any such negative perception whether caused by or not may harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional fund if needed we may be unable to effectively grow or manage the compliance residual value financing and credit risk related to our various financing program we offer financing arrangement for our vehicle in north america europe and asia primarily ourselves and through various financial institution we also currently offer vehicle financing arrangement directly through our local subsidiary in certain market depending on the country such arrangement are available for specified model and may include operating lease directly with under which we typically receive only very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease followed by stream of payment over the term of the lease we have also offered various arrangement for customer of our solar energy system whereby they pay fixed payment to lease or finance the purchase of such system or purchase electricity generated by them if we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national state and or local financial regulation and consumer protection law governing these transaction we may become subject to enforcement action or penalty the profitability of any directly leased vehicle returned to at the end of their lease depends on our ability to accurately project our vehicle residual value at the outset of the lease and such value may fluctuate prior to the end of their term depending on various factor such supply and demand of our used vehicle economic cycle and the pricing of new vehicle we have made in the past and may make in the future certain adjustment to our price from time to time in the ordinary course of business which may impact the residual value of our vehicle and reduce the profitability of our vehicle leasing program the funding and growth of this program also rely on our ability to secure adequate financing and or business partner if we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program through internal fund partner or other financing source and compelling alternative financing program are not available for our customer who may expect or need such option we may be unable to grow our vehicle delivery furthermore if our vehicle leasing business grows substantially our business may suffer if we can not effectively manage the resulting greater level of residual risk similarly we have provided resale value guarantee to vehicle customer and partner for certain financing program under which such counterparties may sell their vehicle back to at certain point in time at pre determined amount however actual resale value are subject to fluctuation over the term of the financing arrangement such from the vehicle pricing change discussed if the actual resale value of any vehicle resold or returned to pursuant to these program are materially lower than the pre determined amount we have offered our financial condition and operating result may be harmed finally our vehicle and solar energy system financing program and our energy storage sale program also expose to customer credit risk in the event of widespread economic downturn or other catastrophic event our customer may be unable or unwilling to satisfy their payment obligation to on timely basis or at all if significant number of our customer default we may incur substantial credit loss and or impairment charge with respect to the underlying asset we must manage ongoing obligation under our agreement with the research foundation for the state university of new york relating to our gigafactory new york we are party to an operating lease and research and development agreement through the state university of new york the suny foundation these agreement provide for the construction and use of our gigafactory new york which we have primarily used for the development and production of our solar roof and other solar product and component energy storage component and supercharger component and for other lessor approved function under this agreement we are obligated to among other thing meet employment target well specified minimum number of personnel in the state of new york and in buffalo new york and spend or incur billion in combined capital operational expense cost of good sold and other cost in the state of new york during period that wa initially year beginning april of december we are currently in excess of such target relating to investment and personnel in the state of new york and buffalo while we expect to have and grow significant operation at gigafactory new york and the surrounding buffalo area any failure by in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet all applicable future obligation may result in our obligation to pay program payment of million to the suny foundation for such year the termination of our lease at gigafactory new york which may require to pay additional penalty and or the need to adjust certain of our operation in particular our production ramp of the solar roof or other component any of the foregoing event may harm our business financial condition and operating result if we are unable to attract hire and retain key employee and qualified personnel our ability to compete may be harmed the loss of the service of any of our key employee or any significant portion of our workforce could disrupt our operation or delay the development introduction and ramp of our product and service in particular we are highly dependent on the service of elon musk technoking of tesla and our chief executive officer none of our key employee is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business our future success also depends upon our ability to attract hire and retain large number of engineering manufacturing marketing sale and delivery service installation technology and support personnel especially to support our planned high volume product sale market and geographical expansion and technological innovation if we are not successful in managing these risk our business financial condition and operating result may be harmed employee may leave tesla or choose other employer over tesla due to various factor such very competitive labor market for talented individual with automotive or technology experience or any negative publicity related to in region where we have or will have operation particularly significant engineering and manufacturing center there is strong competition for individual with skillsets needed for our business including specialized knowledge of electric vehicle engineering and electrical and building construction expertise moreover we may be impacted by perception relating to reduction in force that we have conducted in the past in order to optimize our organizational structure and reduce cost and the departure of certain senior personnel for various reason we also compete with both mature and prosperous company that have far greater financial resource than we do and start ups and emerging company that promise short term growth opportunity finally our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origin with an emphasis on equity based award and benefit in order to closely align their incentive with the long term interest of our stockholder we periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholder for future increase to the number of award available under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plan if we are unable to obtain the requisite stockholder approval for such future increase we may have to expend additional cash to compensate our employee and our ability to retain and hire qualified personnel may be harmed we are highly dependent on the service of elon musk technoking of tesla and our chief executive officer we are highly dependent on the service of elon musk technoking of tesla and our chief executive officer although mr musk spends significant time with tesla and is highly active in our management doe not devote full time and attention to tesla mr musk also currently serf chief executive officer and chief technical officer of space exploration technology corp developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicle chief executive officer of twitter inc social medium company and is involved in other emerging technology venture our information technology system or data or those of our service provider or customer or user could be subject to cyber attack or other security incident which could result in data breach intellectual property theft claim litigation regulatory investigation significant liability reputational damage and other adverse consequence we continue to expand our information technology system our operation grow such product data management procurement inventory management production planning and execution sale service and logistics dealer management financial tax and regulatory compliance system this includes the implementation of new internally developed system and the deployment of such system in the and abroad while we maintain information technology measure designed to protect against intellectual property theft data breach sabotage and other external or internal cyber attack or misappropriation our system and those of our service provider are potentially vulnerable to malware ransomware virus denial of service attack phishing attack social engineering computer hacking unauthorized access exploitation of bug defect and vulnerability breakdown damage interruption

notification law subject to time consuming distracting and expensive litigation regulatory investigation and oversight mandatory corrective action require to verify the correctness of database content or otherwise subject to liability under law regulation and contractual obligation including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information this could result in increased cost to and result in significant legal and financial exposure and or reputational harm we also rely on service provider and similar incident relating to their information technology system could also have material adverse effect on our business there have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attack our service provider including our workforce management software provider have been subject to ransomware and other security incident and we can not guarantee that our or our service provider system have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defect bug or vulnerability that could result in security incident or other disruption to our or our service provider system our ability to monitor our service provider security measure is limited and in any event malicious third party may be able to circumvent those security measure further the implementation maintenance segregation and improvement of these system require significant management time support and cost and there are inherent risk associated with developing improving and expanding our core system well implementing new system and updating current system including disruption to the related area of business operation these risk may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory procure part or supply or manufacture sell deliver and service product adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with or realize available benefit under tax law and other applicable regulation moreover if we do not successfully implement maintain or expand these system planned our operation may be disrupted our ability to accurately and or timely report our financial result could be impaired and deficiency may arise in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact our ability to certify our financial result moreover our proprietary information including intellectual property and personal information could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected if these system or their functionality do not operate we expect them to we may be required to expend significant resource to make correction or find alternative source for performing these function any unauthorized control or manipulation of our product system could result in loss of confidence in and our product our product contain complex information technology system for example our vehicle and energy storage product are designed with built in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote update from to improve or update their functionality while we have implemented security measure intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology network our product and their system malicious entity have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such network product and system to gain control of or to change our product functionality user interface and performance characteristic or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our product we encourage reporting of potential vulnerability in the security of our product through our security vulnerability reporting policy and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability however there can be no assurance that any vulnerability will not be exploited before they can be identified or that our remediation effort are or will be successful any unauthorized access to or control of our product or their system or any loss of data could result in legal claim or government investigation in addition regardless of their veracity report of unauthorized access to our product their system or data well other factor that may result in the perception that our product their system or data are capable of being hacked may harm our brand prospect and operating result we have been the subject of such report in the past our business may be adversely affected by any disruption caused by union activity it is not uncommon for employee of certain trade at company such ours to belong to union which can result in higher employee cost and increased risk of work stoppage moreover regulation in some jurisdiction outside of the mandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreement and work council with certain consultation right with respect to the relevant company operation although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employee they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form labor union or we may be required to become union signatory from time to time labor union have engaged in campaign to organize certain of our operation part of which such union have filed unfair labor practice charge against with the national labor relation board the nlrb and they may do so in the future in september an administrative law judge issued recommended decision for tesla on certain issue and against on certain others in march the nlrb adopted portion of the recommendation and overturned others tesla appealed the decision to the united state circuit court for the fifth circuit which is currently pending any unfavorable ultimate outcome for tesla may have negative impact on the perception of tesla treatment of our employee furthermore we are directly or indirectly dependent upon company with unionized work force such supplier and trucking and freight company any work stoppage or strike organized by such union could delay the manufacture and sale of our product and may harm our business and operating result we may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recall or take other similar action manufacturing company we must manage the risk of product recall with respect to our product recall for our vehicle have resulted from various hardware and software related safety defect or non compliance determination in addition to recall initiated by for various cause testing of or investigation into our product by government regulator or industry group may compel to initiate product recall or may result in negative public perception about the safety of our product even if we disagree with the defect determination or have data that contradicts it in the future we may voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recall if any of our product are determined by or regulator to contain safety defect or be noncompliant with applicable law and regulation such federal motor vehicle safety standard such recall whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by system or component engineered or manufactured by or our supplier could result in significant expense supply chain complication and service burden and may harm our brand business prospect financial condition and operating result our current and future warranty reserve may be insufficient to cover future warranty claim we provide manufacturer warranty on all new and used tesla vehicle we sell we also provide certain warranty with respect to the energy generation and storage system we sell including on their installation and maintenance for component not manufactured by we generally pas through to our customer the applicable manufacturer warranty but may retain some warranty responsibility for some or all of the life of such component part of our energy generation and storage system contract we may provide the customer with performance guarantee that guarantee that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or other energy performance requirement specified in the contract under these performance guarantee we generally bear the risk of electricity production or other performance shortfall including in some case shortfall caused by failure in component from third party manufacturer these risk are exacerbated in the event such manufacturer cease operation or fail to honor their warranty if our warranty reserve are inadequate to cover future warranty claim on our product our financial condition and operating result may be harmed warranty reserve include our management best estimate of the projected cost to repair or to replace item under warranty which are based on actual claim incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and cost of future claim such estimate are inherently uncertain and change to our historical or projected experience especially with respect to product that we have introduced relatively recently and or that we expect to produce at significantly greater volume than our past product may cause material change to our warranty reserve in the future our insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect from all business risk we may be subject in the ordinary course of business to loss resulting from product liability accident act of god and other claim against for which we may have no insurance coverage general matter we do not maintain much insurance coverage many other company do and in some case we do not maintain any at all additionally the policy that we do have may include significant deductible or self insured retention policy limitation and exclusion and we can not be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future loss or claim against loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limit may require to pay substantial amount which may harm our financial condition and operating result our debt agreement contain covenant restriction that may limit our ability to operate our business the term of certain of our debt facility contain and any of our other future debt agreement may contain covenant restriction that may limit our ability to operate our business including restriction on our and or our subsidiary ability to among other thing incur additional debt or create lien in addition under certain circumstance we are required to comply with fixed charge coverage ratio result of these covenant our ability to respond to change in business and economic condition and engage in beneficial transaction including to obtain additional financing needed may be restricted furthermore our failure to comply with our debt covenant could result in default under our debt agreement which could permit the holder to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient fund available to repay it additional fund may not be available to when we need or want them our business and our future plan for expansion are capital intensive and the specific timing of cash inflow and outflow may fluctuate substantially from period to period we may need or want to raise additional fund through the issuance of equity equity related or debt security or through obtaining credit from financial institution to fund together with our principal source of liquidity the cost of developing and manufacturing our current or future product to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expense or for new significant strategic investment or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness even if not required to do so by the term of such indebtedness we can not be certain that additional fund will be available to on favorable term when required or at all if we can not raise additional fund when we need them our financial condition result of operation business and prospect could be materially and adversely affected we may be negatively impacted by any early obsolescence of our manufacturing equipment we depreciate the cost of our manufacturing equipment over their expected useful life however product cycle or manufacturing technology may change periodically and we may decide to update our product or manufacturing process more quickly than expected moreover improvement in engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency may result in our ability to manufacture our product using le of our currently installed equipment alternatively we ramp and mature the production of our product to higher level we may discontinue the use of already installed equipment in favor of different or additional equipment the useful life of any equipment that would be retired early result would be shortened causing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated and our result of operation may be harmed there is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness or that we will not incur additional indebtedness of december we and our subsidiary had outstanding billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness see note debt to the consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form our consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry condition we and our subsidiary may subject to the limitation in the term of our existing and future indebtedness incur additional debt secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt our ability to make scheduled payment of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due to make payment upon conversion or repurchase demand with respect to our convertible senior note or to refinance our indebtedness we may need or desire depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factor beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operation in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligation under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditure if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternative such reducing or delaying investment or capital expenditure selling asset refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on term that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital market and our financial condition at such time in addition our ability to make payment may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreement governing our future indebtedness we may not be able to engage in these activity on desirable term or at all which may result in default on our existing or future indebtedness and harm our financial condition and operating result we are exposed to fluctuation in currency exchange rate we transact business globally in multiple currency and have foreign currency risk related to our revenue cost of revenue operating expense and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currency other than the dollar currently primarily the chinese yuan euro pound sterling and norwegian krone to the extent we have significant revenue denominated in such foreign currency any strengthening of the dollar would tend to reduce our revenue measured in dollar we have historically experienced and are currently experiencing in addition portion of our cost and expense have been and we anticipate will continue to be denominated in foreign currency including the chinese yuan and japanese yen if we do not have fully offsetting revenue in these currency and if the value of the dollar depreciates significantly against these currency our cost measured in dollar percent of our revenue will correspondingly increase and our margin will suffer moreover while we undertake limited hedging activity intended to offset the impact of currency translation exposure it is impossible to predict or eliminate such impact result our operating result may be harmed we may need to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claim which may be time consuming and expensive our competitor or other third party may hold or obtain patent copyright trademark or other proprietary right that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use develop sell or market our product and service which could make it more difficult for to operate our business from time to time the holder of such intellectual property right may assert their right and urge to take license and or may bring suit alleging infringement or misappropriation of such right which could result in substantial cost negative publicity and management attention regardless of merit while we endeavor to obtain and protect the intellectual property right that we expect will allow to retain or advance our strategic initiative there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately identify and protect the portion of intellectual property that are strategic to our business or mitigate the risk of potential suit or other legal demand by our competitor accordingly we may consider the entering into licensing agreement with respect to such right although no assurance can be given that such license can be obtained on acceptable term or that litigation will not occur and such license and associated litigation could significantly increase our operating expense in addition if we are determined to have or believe there is high likelihood that we have infringed upon third party intellectual property right we may be required to cease making selling or incorporating certain component or intellectual property into the good and service we offer to pay substantial damage and or license royalty to redesign our product and service and or to establish and maintain alternative branding for our product and service in the event that we are required to take one or more such action our brand business financial condition and operating result may be harmed increased scrutiny and changing expectation from stakeholder with respect to the company esg practice may result in additional cost or risk company across many industry are facing increasing scrutiny related to their environmental social and governance esg practice investor advocacy group certain institutional investor investment fund and other influential investor are also increasingly focused on esg practice and in recent year have placed increasing importance on the non financial impact of their investment while our mission is to accelerate the world transition to sustainable energy if our esg practice do not meet investor or other industry stakeholder expectation which continue to evolve we may incur additional cost and our brand ability to attract and retain qualified employee and business may be harmed our operation could be adversely affected by event outside of our control such natural disaster war or health epidemic we may be impacted by natural disaster war health epidemic weather condition the long term effect of climate change power outage or other event outside of our control for example our fremont factory and gigafactory nevada are located in seismically active region in northern california and nevada and our gigafactory shanghai is located in flood prone area moreover the area in which our gigafactory texas is located experienced severe winter storm in the first quarter of that had widespread impact on utility and transportation if major disaster such earthquake flood or other climate related event occur or our information system or communication break or operates improperly our headquarters and production facility may be seriously damaged or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our product in addition the global covid pandemic ha impacted economic market manufacturing operation supply chain employment and consumer behavior in nearly every geographic region and industry across the world and we have been and may in the future be adversely affected result also the broader consequence in the current conflict between russia and ukraine which may include further embargo regional instability and geopolitical shift airspace ban relating to certain route or strategic decision to alter certain route and potential retaliatory action by the russian government against company and the extent of the conflict on our business and operating result can not be predicted we may incur expense or delay relating to such event outside of our control which could have material adverse impact on our business operating result and financial condition risk related to government law and regulation demand for our product and service may be impacted by the status of government and economic incentive supporting the development and adoption of such product government and economic incentive that support the development and adoption of electric vehicle in the and abroad including certain tax exemption tax credit and rebate may be reduced eliminated or exhausted from time to time for example previously available incentive favoring electric vehicle in area including ontario canada netherlands italy hong kong and california have expired or were cancelled or temporarily unavailable and in some case were not eventually replaced or reinstituted which may have negatively impacted sale certain government and economic incentive similar to the ira may also be implemented that provide benefit to manufacturer who assemble domestically have local supplier or have other characteristic that may not apply to tesla such development could negatively impact demand for our vehicle and we and our customer may have to adjust to them including through pricing modification in addition certain governmental rebate tax credit and other financial incentive that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy storage product business allow to lower our cost and encourage customer to buy our product and investor to invest in our solar financing fund however these incentive may expire when the allocated funding is exhausted reduced or terminated renewable energy adoption rate increase sometimes without warning likewise in jurisdiction where net metering is currently available our customer receive bill credit from utility for energy that their solar energy system generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use the benefit available under net metering ha been or ha been proposed to be reduced altered or eliminated in several jurisdiction and ha also been contested and may continue to be contested before the federal energy regulatory commission any reduction or termination of such incentive may harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result by making our product le competitive for customer increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partner and to form new financing fund for our solar and energy storage asset finally we and our fund investor claim these federal tax credit and certain state incentive in amount based on independently appraised fair market value of our solar and energy storage system some governmental authority have audited such value and in certain case have determined that these value should be lower and they may do so again in the future such determination may result in adverse tax consequence and or our obligation to make indemnification or other payment to our fund or fund investor we are subject to evolving law and regulation that could impose substantial cost legal prohibition or unfavorable change upon our operation or product we grow our manufacturing operation in additional region we are or will be subject to complex environmental manufacturing health and safety law and regulation at numerous jurisdictional level in the china germany and other location abroad including law relating to the use handling storage recycling disposal and or human exposure to hazardous material product material input and post consumer product and with respect to constructing expanding and maintaining our facility new or change in environmental and climate change law regulation or rule could also lead to increased cost of compliance including remediation of any discovered issue and change to our operation which may be significant and any failure to comply could result in significant expense delay or fine in addition we have increased our employee headcount and operation we are and may continue to be subject to increased scrutiny including litigation and government investigation relating to allegation such discrimination and workplace misconduct that we will need to defend against if we are unable to successfully defend ourselves in such litigation or government investigation it may harm our brand ability to attract and retain qualified employee business and financial condition we are also subject to law and regulation applicable to the supply manufacture import sale service and performance of our product both domestically and abroad for example in country outside of the we are required to meet standard relating to vehicle safety fuel economy and emission that are often materially different from equivalent requirement in the thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicle and system to ensure regulatory compliance in all country this process may include official review and certification of our vehicle by foreign regulatory agency prior to market entry well compliance with foreign reporting and recall management system requirement in particular we offer in our vehicle in certain market autopilot and fsd capability feature that today assist driver with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspect of road travel but which currently require driver to remain fully engaged in the driving operation we are continuing to develop our autopilot and fsd capability technology there are variety of international federal and state regulation that may apply to and may adversely affect the design and performance sale registration and operation of autopilot and fsd capability and future capability including full self driving vehicle that may not be operated by human driver this includes many existing vehicle standard that were not originally intended to apply to vehicle that may not be operated by human driver such regulation continue to rapidly change which increase the likelihood of patchwork of complex or conflicting regulation or may delay restrict or prohibit the availability of certain functionality and vehicle design which could adversely affect our business finally manufacturer installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage system supplier of electricity generated and stored by certain of the solar energy and energy storage system we install for customer and provider of grid service through virtual power plant model we are impacted by federal state and local regulation and policy concerning the import or export of component electricity pricing the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electrical grid and the sale of electricity generated by third party owned system if regulation and policy are introduced that adversely impact the import or export of component or the interconnection maintenance or use of our solar and energy storage system they could deter potential customer from purchasing our solar and energy storage product and service threaten the economics of our existing contract and cause to cease solar and energy storage system sale and service in the relevant jurisdiction which may harm our business financial condition and operating result any failure by to comply with variety of and international privacy and consumer protection law may harm any failure by or our vendor or other business partner to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal state or international privacy data protection or security law or regulation relating to the processing collection use retention security and transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigation related action against legal liability fine damage ongoing audit requirement and other significant cost substantial expense and operational change may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such law and even an unsuccessful challenge by customer or regulatory authority of our activity could result in adverse publicity and could require costly response from and defense by in addition certain emerging privacy law are still subject to high degree of uncertainty to their interpretation application and impact and may require extensive system and operational change be difficult to implement increase our operating cost adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the product or service we offer or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation for example the general data protection regulation applies to the processing of personal information collected from individual located in the european union and ha created new compliance obligation and significantly increased fine for noncompliance similarly the california consumer privacy act imposes certain legal obligation on our use and processing of personal information related to california resident finally new privacy and cybersecurity law have come into effect in china in addition to the risk related to general privacy regulation we may also be subject to specific vehicle manufacturer obligation relating to cybersecurity data privacy and data localization requirement which place additional risk to our international operation risk and penalty could include ongoing audit requirement data protection authority investigation legal proceeding by international governmental entity or others resulting in mandated disclosure of sensitive data or other commercially unfavorable term notwithstanding our effort to protect the security and integrity of our customer personal information we may be required to expend significant resource to comply with data breach requirement if for example third party improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customer or we otherwise experience data loss with respect to customer personal information major breach of our network security and system may result in fine penalty and damage and harm our brand prospect and operating result we could be subject to liability penalty and other restrictive sanction and adverse consequence arising out of certain governmental investigation and proceeding we are cooperating with certain government investigation discussed in note commitment and contingency to the consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form to our knowledge no government agency in any such ongoing investigation ha concluded that any wrongdoing occurred however we can not predict the outcome or impact of any such ongoing matter and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability penalty and other restrictive sanction and adverse consequence if the sec the department of justice or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future moreover we expect to incur cost in responding to related request for information and subpoena and if instituted in defending against any governmental proceeding for example on october the district court for the southern district of new york entered final judgment approving the term of settlement filed with the court on september in connection with the action taken by the sec relating to mr musk statement on august that he wa considering taking tesla private pursuant to the settlement we among other thing paid civil penalty of million appointed an independent director the chair of our board of director appointed two additional independent director to our board of director and made further enhancement to our disclosure control and other corporate governance related matter on april this settlement wa amended to clarify certain of the previously agreed disclosure procedure which wa subsequently approved by the court all other term of the prior settlement were reaffirmed without modification although we intend to continue to comply with the term and requirement of the settlement if there is lack of compliance or an alleged lack of compliance additional enforcement action or other legal proceeding may be instituted against we may face regulatory challenge to or limitation on our ability to sell vehicle directly while we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sale strategy including sale through our website we may not be able to sell our vehicle through our own store in certain state in the with law that may be interpreted to impose limitation on this direct to consumer sale model it ha also been asserted that the law in some state limit our ability to obtain dealer license from state motor vehicle regulator and such assertion persist in certain location decision by regulator permitting to sell vehicle have been and may be challenged by dealer association and others to whether such decision comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry law we have prevailed in many of these lawsuit and such result have reinforced our continuing belief that state franchise law were not intended to apply to manufacturer that doe not have franchise dealer anywhere in the world in some state there have also been regulatory and legislative effort by dealer association to propose law that if enacted would prevent from obtaining dealer license in their state given our current sale model few state have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate but at the same time limit the number of dealer license we can obtain or store that we can operate the application of state law applicable to our operation continues to be difficult to predict internationally there may be law in jurisdiction we have not yet entered or law we are unaware of in jurisdiction we have entered that may restrict our sale or other business practice even for those jurisdiction we have analyzed the law in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time continued regulatory limitation and other obstacle interfering with our ability to sell vehicle directly to consumer may harm our financial condition and operating result risk related to the ownership of our common stock the trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile the trading price of our common stock ha been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuation in response to various factor some of which are beyond our control our common stock ha experienced over the last week an intra day trading high of per share and low of per share adjusted to give effect to the three for one stock split in the form of stock dividend in august the stock split the stock market in general and the market for technology company in particular ha experienced extreme price and volume fluctuation that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those company in particular large proportion of our common stock ha been historically and may in the future be traded by short seller which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock further influencing volatility in it market price public perception of our company or management and other factor outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of company like that garner disproportionate degree of public attention regardless of actual operating performance in addition in the past following period of volatility in the overall market or the market price of our share security class action litigation ha been filed against while we defend such action vigorously any judgment against or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of our management attention and resource our financial result may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuation in our operating cost and other factor we expect our period to period financial result to vary based on our operating cost which we anticipate will fluctuate the pace at which we continue to design develop and manufacture new product and increase production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facility and adding future facility may not be consistent or linear between period additionally our revenue from period to period may fluctuate we introduce existing product to new market for the first time and we develop and introduce new product result of these factor we believe that quarter to quarter comparison of our financial result especially in the short term are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparison can not be relied upon indicator of future performance moreover our financial result may not meet expectation of equity research analyst rating agency or investor who may be focused only on short term quarterly financial result if any of this occurs the trading price of our stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time we may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectation about our business which could cause our stock price to decline we may provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance correctly identifying key factor affecting business condition and predicting future event is inherently an uncertain process and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate and ha in the past been inaccurate in certain respect such the timing of new product manufacturing ramp our guidance is based on certain assumption such those relating to anticipated production and sale volume which generally are not linear throughout given period average sale price supplier and commodity cost and planned cost reduction if our guidance varies from actual result such due to our assumption not being met or the impact on our financial performance that could occur result of various risk and uncertainty the market value of our common stock could decline significantly if elon musk were forced to sell share of our common stock either that he ha pledged to secure certain personal loan obligation or in satisfaction of other obligation such sale could cause our stock price to decline certain banking institution have made extension of credit to elon musk our chief executive officer portion of which wa used to purchase share of common stock in certain of our public offering and private placement at the same price offered to third party participant in such offering and placement we are not party to these loan which are partially secured by pledge of portion of the tesla common stock currently owned by mr musk if the price of our common stock were to decline substantially mr musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institution to sell share of tesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligation if he could not do so through other mean any such sale could cause the price of our common stock to decline further further mr musk from time to time may commit to investing in significant business or other venture and result be required to sell share of our common stock in satisfaction of such commitment anti takeover provision contained in our governing document applicable law and our convertible senior note could impair takeover attempt our certificate of incorporation and bylaw afford certain right and power to our board of director that may facilitate the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable we are also subject to section of the delaware general corporation law and other provision of delaware law that limit the ability of stockholder in certain situation to effect certain business combination in addition the term of our convertible senior note may require to repurchase such note in the event of fundamental change including takeover of our company any of the foregoing provision and term that ha the effect of delaying or deterring change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholder to receive premium for their share of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investor are

of operation in our annual report on form for fiscal year which wa filed with the security and exchange commission on february overview and highlight our mission is to accelerate the world transition to sustainable energy we design develop manufacture lease and sell high performance fully electric vehicle solar energy generation system and energy storage product we also offer maintenance installation operation financial and other service related to our product additionally we are increasingly focused on product and service based on artificial intelligence robotics and automation in we produced consumer vehicle and delivered consumer vehicle despite ongoing supply chain and logistics challenge and factory shutdown we are currently focused on increasing vehicle production capacity and delivery capability improving and developing battery technology improving our fsd capability increasing the affordability and efficiency of our vehicle bringing new product to market and expanding our global infrastructure in we deployed gwh of energy storage product and megawatt of solar energy system we are currently focused on ramping production of energy storage product improving our solar roof installation capability and efficiency and increasing market share of retrofit and new build solar energy system in we recognized total revenue of billion respectively representing an increase of billion compared to the prior year we continue to ramp production build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operation to enable increased delivery and deployment of our product and further revenue growth in our net income attributable to common stockholder wa billion representing favorable change of billion compared to the prior year we continue to focus on improving our profitability through production and operational efficiency we ended with billion in cash and cash equivalent and investment representing an increase of billion from the end of our cash flow provided by operating activity during and were billion and billion respectively representing an increase of billion capital expenditure amounted to billion during compared to billion during sustained growth ha allowed our business to generally fund and we will continue investing in number of capital intensive project in upcoming period management opportunity challenge and uncertainty and outlook automotive production the following is summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle model in production and under development of the date of this annual report on form production location vehicle model production status fremont factory model model active model model active gigafactory shanghai model model active gigafactory berlin brandenburg model active gigafactory texas model active cybertruck tooling gigafactory nevada tesla semi pilot production tbd tesla roadster in development tbd robotaxi others in development we are focused on growing our manufacturing capacity which includes ramping all of our production vehicle to their installed production capacity well increasing production rate efficiency and capacity at our current factory the next phase of production growth will depend on the ramp at gigafactory berlin brandenburg and gigafactory texas well our ability to add to our available source of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cell that we are developing to have high volume output lower capital and production cost and longer range our goal are to improve vehicle performance decrease production cost and increase affordability however these plan are subject to uncertainty inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operation which may be exacerbated by the new product and manufacturing technology we are introducing the number of concurrent international project any industry wide component constraint labor shortage and any future impact from event outside of our control such the covid pandemic moreover we have set ambitious technological target with our plan for battery cell well for iterative manufacturing and design improvement for our vehicle with each new factory automotive demand and sale our cost reduction effort cost innovation strategy and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicle affordability and for example have allowed to competitively price our vehicle in china we will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicle performance and functionality including through product based on artificial intelligence such autopilot and fsd and other software feature and delivering new vehicle such the tesla semi in december moreover we expect to continue to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing environmental awareness however we operate in cyclical industry that is sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty including with respect to trade and the environment all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressure rising energy price increase in interest rate and any future global impact from the covid pandemic for example in the earlier part of the automotive industry in general experienced part shortage and supplier disruption which impacted production leading to general increase in vehicle pricing the year progressed inflationary pressure increased across the market in which we operate in an effort to curb this trend central bank in developed country raised interest rate rapidly and substantially impacting the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangement further sale of vehicle in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many market which may expose to increased volatility we expand and adjust our operation moreover additional competitor enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation we will have to adjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum these macroeconomic and industry trend have had and will likely continue to have an impact on the pricing of and order rate for our vehicle and we will continue to adjust accordingly to such development automotive delivery and customer infrastructure our production increase we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it doe not become bottleneck on our total delivery beginning the second half of due to continuing challenge caused by vehicle transportation capacity during peak delivery period we began transitioning to more even regional mix of vehicle build each week which led to an increase in car in transit at the end of the year increasing the export of vehicle manufactured at gigafactory shanghai ha also been effective in mitigating the strain on our delivery in market outside of the united state and we expect to benefit further from situating additional factory closer to local market including the production launch at gigafactory berlin brandenburg and gigafactory austin we expand our manufacturing operation globally we will also have to continue to increase and staff our delivery servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our supercharger location to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction in particular we remain focused on increasing the capability and efficiency of our servicing operation energy generation and storage demand production and deployment the long term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margin through greater volume we continue to increase the production of our energy storage product to meet high level of demand for megapack energy storage deployment can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestone for powerwall better availability and growing grid stability concern drive higher customer interest we remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering low cost and simplified online ordering experience in addition we continue to seek to improve our installation capability and price efficiency for solar roof these product line grow we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage product and hire additional personnel particularly skilled electrician to support the ramp of solar roof cash flow and capital expenditure trend our capital expenditure are typically difficult to project beyond the short term given the number and breadth of our core project at any given time and may further be impacted by uncertainty in future global market condition we are simultaneously ramping new product ramping manufacturing facility on three continent and piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technology and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among project the pace at which we meet milestone production adjustment to and among our various product increased capital efficiency and the addition of new project owing and subject to the foregoing well the pipeline of announced project under development all other continuing infrastructure growth and varying level of inflation we currently expect our capital expenditure to be between to billion in and between to billion in each of the following two fiscal year our business ha recently been consistently generating cash flow from operation in excess of our level of capital spend and with better working capital management resulting in shorter day sale outstanding than day payable outstanding our sale growth is also facilitating positive cash generation we have and will continue to utilize such cash flow among other thing to do more vertical integration expand our product roadmap and provide financing option to our customer on the other hand we are likely to see heightened level of capital expenditure during certain period depending on the specific pace of our capital intensive project and rising material price and increasing supply chain and labor expense resulting from change in global trade condition and labor availability associated with the covid pandemic overall we expect our ability to be self funding to continue long macroeconomic factor support current trend in our sale operating expense trend long we see expanding sale and excluding the potential impact of macroeconomic condition including increased labor cost and impairment charge on certain asset explained below we generally expect operating expense relative to revenue to decrease we continue to increase operational efficiency and process automation we expect operating expense to continue to grow in we are expanding our operation globally in the first quarter of we invested an aggregate billion in bitcoin with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiat based cash and cash equivalent account we may increase or decrease our holding of digital asset at any time based on the need of the business and our view of market and environmental condition digital asset are considered indefinite lived intangible asset under applicable accounting rule accordingly any decrease in their fair value below our carrying value for such asset at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require to recognize impairment charge whereas we may make no upward revision for any market price increase sale for any digital asset held or in the future these charge may negatively impact our profitability in the period in which such impairment occur even if the overall market value of these asset increase for example in the year ended december we recorded million of impairment loss resulting from change to the carrying value of our bitcoin and gain of million on certain conversion of bitcoin into fiat currency by critical accounting policy and estimate the consolidated financial statement are prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the gaap the preparation of the consolidated financial statement requires to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue cost and expense and related disclosure we base our estimate on historical experience appropriate and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance change in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual result could differ significantly from the estimate made by our management we evaluate our estimate and assumption on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material difference between these estimate and actual result our future financial statement presentation financial condition result of operation and cash flow may be affected the estimate used for but not limited to determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangement sale return reserve the collectability of account and financing receivables inventory valuation warranty fair value of long lived asset goodwill fair value of financial instrument fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicle and solar energy system subject to lease could be impacted we have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that required an update to our estimate and assumption or materially affected the carrying value of our asset or liability of the date of issuance of this annual report on form these estimate may change new event occur and additional information is obtained actual result could differ materially from these estimate under different assumption or condition revenue recognition automotive sale automotive sale revenue includes revenue related to cash and financing delivery of new vehicle and specific other feature and service that meet the definition of performance obligation under accounting standard codification asc revenue from contract with customer asc including access to our fsd feature internet connectivity supercharger network and over the air software update we recognize revenue on automotive sale upon delivery to the customer which is when the control of vehicle transfer payment are typically received at the point control transfer or in accordance with payment term customary to the business except sale we finance for which payment are collected over the contractual loan term we also recognize sale return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market value when we offer resale value guarantee or similar buyback term other feature and service such access to our internet connectivity legacy program offering unlimited free supercharging and over the air software update are provisioned upon control transfer of vehicle and recognized over time on straight line basis we have stand ready obligation to deliver such service to the customer other limited free supercharging incentive are recognized based on actual usage or expiration whichever is earlier we recognize revenue related to these other feature and service over the performance period which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle revenue related to fsd is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and the portion related to software update is recognized over time for our obligation related to automotive sale we estimate standalone selling price by considering cost used to develop and deliver the service third party pricing of similar option and other information that may be available any fee that are paid or payable by to customer lender when we arrange the financing are recognized an offset against automotive sale revenue cost to obtain contract mainly relate to commission paid to our sale personnel for the sale of vehicle our contract cost related to automotive sale are typically fulfilled within one year the cost to obtain contract are expensed incurred amount billed to customer related to shipping and handling are classified automotive sale revenue and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicle part or accessory have transferred to the customer an expense in cost of automotive sale revenue our policy is to exclude tax collected from customer from the transaction price of automotive contract we offer resale value guarantee or similar buy back term to certain international customer who purchase vehicle and who finance their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partner under these program we receive full payment for the vehicle sale price at the time of delivery and our counterparty ha the option of selling their vehicle back to during the guarantee period which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program for pre determined resale value we account for such automotive sale sale with right of return when we do not believe the customer ha significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception the process to determine whether there is significant economic incentive includes comparison of vehicle estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer economic incentive to exercise on quarterly basis we ass the estimated market value of vehicle sold with resale value guarantee to determine whether there have been change to the likelihood of future product return we accumulate more data related to the resale value of our vehicle or market condition change there may be material change to their estimated value inventory valuation inventory are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is computed using standard cost for vehicle and energy product which approximates actual cost on first in first out basis we record inventory write down for excess or obsolete inventory based upon assumption about current and future demand forecast if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amount are written off we also review our inventory to determine whether it carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicle le the estimated cost to convert the inventory on hand into finished product once inventory is written down new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent change in fact and circumstance do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis should our estimate of future selling price or production cost change additional and potentially material write down may be required small change in our estimate may result in material charge to our reported financial result warranty we provide manufacturer warranty on all new and used vehicle and warranty on the installation and component of the energy generation and storage system we sell for period typically between to year we accrue warranty reserve for the product sold by which includes our best estimate of the projected cost to repair or replace item under warranty and recall if identified these estimate are based on actual claim incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and cost of future claim these estimate are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sale and change to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material change to the warranty reserve in the future the warranty reserve doe not include projected warranty cost associated with our vehicle subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy system under lease contract or ppas the cost to repair these warranty claim are expensed incurred the portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next month is included within accrued liability and other while the remaining balance is included within other long term liability on the consolidated balance sheet warranty expense is recorded component of cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operation due to the magnitude of our automotive business accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment stock based compensation we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock option and restricted stock unit rsus granted to employee and for our employee stock purchase plan the espp to measure the cost of employee service received in exchange for the stock based award the fair value of stock option award with only service and or performance condition is estimated on the grant or offering date using the black scholes option pricing model the black scholes option pricing model requires input such the risk free interest rate expected term and expected volatility these input are subjective and generally require significant judgment the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period which is generally four year for stock option and rsus and six month for the espp stock based compensation expense is recognized on straight line basis net of actual forfeiture in the period for performance based award stock based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestone when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable we accumulate additional employee stock based award data over time and we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatility and expected life which could materially impact the valuation of our stock based award and the stock based compensation expense that we will recognize in future period stock based compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenue research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operation income tax we are subject to tax in the and in many foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income tax our deferred tax asset and liability and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax asset we make these estimate and judgment about our future taxable income that are based on assumption that are consistent with our future plan tax law regulation and administrative practice may be subject to change due to economic or political condition including fundamental change to the tax law applicable to corporate multinationals the many country in the european union and number of other country are actively considering change in this regard of december we had recorded full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset because we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax asset will not be realized should the actual amount differ from our estimate the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax position in the ordinary course of business there are many transaction and calculation for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attribute or tax payable based on our estimate of the eventual outcome these effect are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return position are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those position may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authority we are required to file income tax return in the and various foreign jurisdiction which requires to interpret the applicable tax law and regulation in effect in such jurisdiction such return are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authority who may disagree with respect to our tax position we believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit year based on our assessment of many factor including past experience and interpretation of tax law we review and update our estimate in light of changing fact and circumstance such the closing of tax audit the lapse of statute of limitation or change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matter differs from our expectation such difference may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax asset in the period that such determination is made result of operation revenue year ended december change change dollar in million automotive sale automotive regulatory credit automotive leasing total automotive revenue service and other total automotive service and other segment revenue energy generation and storage segment revenue total revenue automotive service and other segment automotive sale revenue includes revenue related to cash and financing delivery of new model model semi model and model vehicle including access to our fsd feature internet connectivity free supercharging program and over the air software update these delivery are vehicle that are not subject to lease accounting automotive regulatory credit includes sale of regulatory credit to other automotive manufacturer our revenue from automotive regulatory credit is directly related to our new vehicle production sale and pricing negotiated with our customer we monetize them proactively new vehicle are sold based on standing arrangement with buyer of such credit typically close possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or change in regulation impacting the credit automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicle under direct operating lease agreement additionally automotive leasing revenue includes direct sale type leasing program where we recognize all revenue associated with the sale type lease upon delivery to the customer service and other revenue consists of non warranty after sale vehicle service and part paid supercharging sale of used vehicle retail merchandise and vehicle insurance revenue compared to automotive sale revenue increased billion or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december primarily due to an increase of model and model delivery and an increase of model and model delivery year over year this wa achieved from production ramping of model at gigafactory shanghai and the fremont factory well the start of production at gigafactory berlin brandenburg and gigafactory texas in at higher combined average selling price from higher proportion of model sale despite negative impact from the united state dollar strengthening against other foreign currency in compared to the prior period there wa also an increase in production of model and model and an increase in the combined average selling price of model and model with higher proportion of model sale compared to the prior period delivery of the new version of model and model began ramping in the second and fourth quarter of respectively further during the fourth quarter of we recognized million in revenue related to the general fsd feature release in north america automotive regulatory credit revenue increased million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december primarily due to change in regulation which entitled to additional consideration of million in revenue in the first quarter of for credit sold previously in the absence of which we had only an immaterial increase in automotive regulatory credit revenue automotive leasing revenue increased million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december the change is primarily due to an increase in activity under our direct operating lease program well an increase in direct sale type leasing revenue service and other revenue increased billion or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december the change is primarily due to increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increase in volume and average selling price of used tesla and non tesla vehicle non warranty maintenance service revenue our fleet continues to grow paid supercharging revenue insurance service revenue and retail merchandise revenue energy generation and storage segment energy generation and storage revenue includes sale and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage product financing of solar energy generation product service related to such product and sale of solar energy system incentive compared to energy generation and storage revenue increased billion or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december primarily due to an increase in energy storage deployment of megapack powerwall and higher average selling price of megapack well on solar cash and loan deployment driven by price increase in cost of revenue and gross margin year ended december change change dollar in

refurbishment cost cost for retail merchandise and cost to provide vehicle insurance compared to cost of automotive sale revenue increased billion or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december in line with the growth in revenue year over year discussed above the average combined cost per unit of model and model increased year over year due to rising raw material logistics and warranty cost there were also idle capacity charge of million primarily related to the temporary suspension of production at gigafactory shanghai well the ramping up of production in gigafactory texas and our proprietary battery cell manufacturing during the year ended december we had also incurred cost related to the ramp up of production in gigafactory berlin brandenburg during the year ended december these increase were partially offset by decrease in combined average model and model cost per unit driven by lower average cost for the new version from ramping up production further these increase in cost of revenue were positively impacted by the united state dollar strengthening against other foreign currency in compared to the prior period cost of automotive leasing revenue increased million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicle under our direct operating lease program and an increase in direct sale type leasing cost of revenue from more activity in the current year cost of service and other revenue increased billion or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december the change is primarily due to an increase in used vehicle cost of revenue driven by increase in volume and cost of used tesla and non tesla vehicle sale an increase in non warranty maintenance service revenue and an increase in cost of paid supercharging insurance service and retail merchandise gross margin for total automotive decreased from to in the year ended december compared to the year ended december this wa driven by the change in automotive sale revenue and cost of automotive sale revenue partially offset by an increase in regulatory credit revenue discussed earlier gross margin for total automotive service and other segment decreased from to in the year ended december compared to the year ended december primarily due to the automotive gross margin decrease discussed above partially offset by an improvement in our service and other gross margin additionally service and other wa higher percentage of the segment gross margin during the year ended compared to the prior year energy generation and storage segment cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor cost warehouse rent freight warranty expense other overhead cost and amortization of certain acquired intangible asset cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charge to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds it estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand in agreement for solar energy system and ppas where we are the lessor the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy system maintenance cost associated with those system and amortization of any initial direct cost compared to cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december primarily due to increase in energy storage deployment of megapack and powerwall well higher average cost of solar cash and loan deployment due to increased component cost gross margin for energy generation and storage increased from to in the year ended december compared to the year ended december this wa driven by the growth in energy generation and storage revenue and cost of energy generation and storage revenue discussed above additionally there wa higher proportion of energy storage sale which operated at higher gross margin within the segment research and development expense year ended december change change dollar in million research and development percentage of revenue research and development expense consist primarily of personnel cost for our team in engineering and research manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organization prototyping expense contract and professional service and amortized equipment expense expense increased million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december the increase wa primarily due to million increase in employee and labor related expense million increase in facility outside service freight and depreciation expense million increase in expensed material and an million increase in stock based compensation expense these increase were to support our expanding product roadmap and technology including our proprietary battery cell further there were additional expense in the first quarter of we were in the pre production phase at gigafactory texas and started production at gigafactory berlin brandenburg only closer to the end of the first quarter of expense percentage of revenue decreased from to in the year ended december compared to the year ended december our expense have decreased proportion of total revenue despite expanding product roadmap and technology selling general and administrative expense year ended december change change dollar in million selling general and administrative percentage of revenue selling general and administrative sg expense generally consist of personnel and facility cost related to our store marketing sale executive finance human resource information technology and legal organization well fee for professional and contract service and litigation settlement sg expense decreased million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december this is primarily due to decrease of million in stock based compensation expense most of which is attributable to the lower stock based compensation expense of million on the ceo performance award this wa partially offset by the overall growth in stock based compensation due to increased headcount see note equity incentive plan to the consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form there wa also decrease of million in overall employee and labor related expense driven by decrease of million of additional payroll tax due to our ceo option exercise from the ceo performance award in partially offset by an increase in other employee and labor cost from increased headcount these decrease were partially offset by an increase of million in facility related expense and an increase of million in professional service sale and marketing activity and other cost sg expense percentage of revenue decreased from to in the year ended december compared to the year ended december our sg expense have decreased proportion of total revenue due to the decrease in expense discussed above in addition to operational efficiency restructuring and other expense year ended december change change dollar in million restructuring and other not meaningful not meaningful during the year ended december and we recorded million and million respectively of impairment loss on digital asset respectively during the year ended december and we also realized gain of million and million respectively in connection with converting our holding of digital asset into fiat currency see note digital asset net to the consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form for further detail additionally we recorded other expense of million during the second quarter of the year ended december related to employee termination interest income year ended december change change dollar in million interest income interest income increased million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december this increase wa primarily due to higher interest earned on our cash and cash equivalent and short term investment during the year ended compared to the prior period this wa driven by an increase in our average cash and cash equivalent and short term investment balance and rising interest rate interest expense year ended december change change dollar in million interest expense interest expense decreased million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december this decrease wa primarily due to the continued reduction in our overall debt balance offset by lower capitalized interest see note debt to the consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form for further detail other expense income net year ended december change change dollar in million other expense income net not meaningful not meaningful other expense income net consists primarily of foreign exchange gain and loss related to our foreign currency denominated monetary asset and liability we expect our foreign exchange gain and loss will vary depending upon movement in the underlying exchange rate other expense income net changed unfavorably by million in the year ended december compared to the year ended december the change is primarily due to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate provision for income tax year ended december change change dollar in million provision for income tax effective tax rate our provision for income tax increased by million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december primarily due to the increase in our pre tax income year over year our effective tax rate decreased from to in the year ended december compared to the year ended december primarily due to change in mix of jurisdictional earnings see note income tax to the consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form for further detail net income attributable to noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest year ended december change change dollar in million net income attributable to noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiary net income attributable to noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest decreased by million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december these change were due to decrease in allocation to financing fund investor liquidity and capital resource we expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow we have done in the last four fiscal year the cash we generate from our core operation enables to fund ongoing operation and production our research and development project for new product and technology including our proprietary battery cell additional manufacturing ramp at existing manufacturing facility such the fremont factory gigafactory nevada gigafactory shanghai and gigafactory new york the ramp of gigafactory berlin brandenburg and gigafactory texas and the continued expansion of our retail and service location body shop mobile service fleet supercharger network and energy product installation capability in addition because large portion of our future expenditure will be to fund our growth we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our capital and operating expenditure by operating segment for example if our near term manufacturing operation decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected including due to global economic or business condition we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditure finally we continually evaluate our cash need and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing source to fund the rapid growth of our business including through drawdowns on

the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds it estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand in agreement for solar energy system and ppas where we are the lessor the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy system maintenance cost associated with those system and amortization of any initial direct cost research and development costsresearch and development cost are expensed incurred income taxesincome tax are computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax asset and liability are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax base of asset and liability using enacted tax rate in effect for the year in which the difference are expected to affect taxable income valuation allowance are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax asset to the amount expected to be realized we record liability related to uncertain tax position when despite our belief that our tax return position are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those position may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authority accrued interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit are classified income tax expense the tax cut and job act tcja subject shareholder to tax on global intangible low taxed income gilti earned by certain foreign subsidiary under gaap we can make an accounting policy election to either treat tax due on the gilti inclusion current period expense or factor such amount into our measurement of deferred tax we elected the deferred method under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax asset and liability in our consolidated balance sheet currently subject to valuation allowance comprehensive incomecomprehensive income is comprised of net income and other comprehensive loss income other comprehensive loss income consists of foreign currency translation adjustment and unrealized net gain and loss on investment that have been excluded from the determination of net income stock based compensationwe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock option and rsus granted to employee and for our espp to measure the cost of employee service received in exchange for the stock based award the fair value of stock option award with only service and or performance condition is estimated on the grant or offering date using the black scholes option pricing model the black scholes option pricing model requires input such the risk free interest rate expected term and expected volatility these input are subjective and generally require significant judgment the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period which is generally four year for stock option and rsus and six month for the espp stock based compensation expense is recognized on straight line basis net of actual forfeiture in the period for performance based award stock based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestone when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable we accumulate additional employee stock based award data over time and we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatility and expected life which could materially impact the valuation of our stock based award and the stock based compensation expense that we will recognize in future period stock based compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenue research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operation noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interestsnoncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest represent third party interest in the net asset under certain funding arrangement or fund that we have entered into to finance the cost of solar energy system and vehicle under operating lease we have determined that the contractual provision of the fund represent substantive profit sharing arrangement we have further determined that the methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balance that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangement is balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value hlbv method we therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest in the net asset of the fund at each balance sheet date using the hlbv method which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet noncontrolling interest in subsidiary and redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiary under the hlbv method the amount reported noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amount the third party would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provision of the fund assuming the net asset of the fund were liquidated at their recorded amount determined in accordance with gaap and with tax law effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third party the third party interest in the result of operation of the fund are determined the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balance in the consolidated balance sheet between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transaction between the fund and the third party however the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third party have the right to redeem their interest in the fund for cash or other asset for certain fund there may be significant fluctuation in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiary due to change in the liquidation provision time based milestone are reached net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholdersbasic net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholder is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholder by the weighted average share of common stock outstanding for the period potentially dilutive share which are based on the weighted average share of common stock underlying outstanding stock based award warrant and convertible senior note using the treasury stock method or the if converted method applicable are included when calculating diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholder when their effect is dilutive furthermore in connection with the offering of our convertible senior note we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant see note debt however our convertible note hedge are not included when calculating potentially dilutive share since their effect is always anti dilutive the strike price on the warrant were below our average share price during the period and were included in the table below warrant are included in the weighted average share used in computing basic net income per share of common stock in the period they are settled the following table present the reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholder to net income used in computing basic and diluted net income per share of common stock in million year ended december net income attributable to common stockholder le buy out of noncontrolling interest net income used in computing basic net income

because their effect wa anti dilutive adjusted to give effect to the stock split in million year ended december stock based award convertible senior note under the modified retrospective method of adoption of asu the dilutive impact of convertible senior note wa calculated using the if converted method for the year ended december and certain convertible senior note were calculated using the treasury stock method for the year ended december business combinationswe account for business acquisition under asc business combination the total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured the fair value of the asset given equity instrument issued and liability assumed at the acquisition date cost that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed incurred identifiable asset including intangible asset liability assumed including contingent liability and noncontrolling interest in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date we recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interest is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable asset acquired and the liability assumed we recognize bargain purchase gain within other expense income net in the consolidated statement of operation if the net fair value of the identifiable asset acquired and the liability assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interest we include the result of operation of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statement beginning on the acquisition date cash and cash equivalentsall highly liquid investment with an original maturity of three month or le at the date of purchase are considered cash

investment in our consolidated balance sheet interest dividend amortization and accretion of purchase premium and discount on these investment are included within interest income in our consolidated statement of operation the cost of available for sale investment sold is based on the specific identification method realized gain and loss on the sale of available for sale investment are recorded in other expense income net we regularly review all of our investment for decline in fair value the review includes but is not limited to the consideration of the cause of the decline ii any currently recorded expected credit loss and iii the creditworthiness of the respective security issuer the amortized cost basis of our investment approximates it fair value account receivable and allowance for doubtful accountsaccounts receivable primarily include amount related to receivables from financial institution and leasing company offering various financing product to our customer sale of energy generation and storage product sale of regulatory credit to other automotive manufacturer and government rebate already passed through to customer we provide an allowance against account receivable for the amount we expect to be uncollectible we write off account receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible depending on the day of the week on which the end of fiscal quarter fall our account receivable balance may fluctuate we are waiting for certain customer payment to clear through our banking institution and receipt of payment from our financing partner which can take up to approximately two week based on the contractual payment term with such partner our account receivable balance associated with our sale of regulatory credit which are typically transferred to other manufacturer during the last few day of the quarter is dependent on contractual payment term additionally government rebate can take up to year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timeline of the specific jurisdiction issuing them these various factor may have significant impact on our account receivable balance from period to period of december and december we had million and million respectively of long term government rebate receivable in other non current asset in our consolidated balance sheet financing receivableswe provide financing option to our customer for our automotive and energy product financing receivables are carried at amortized cost net of allowance for loan loss provision for loan loss are charged to operation in amount sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan loss at level considered adequate to cover expected credit loss on the financing receivables in determining expected credit loss we consider our historical level of credit loss current economic trend and reasonable and supportable forecast that affect the collectability of the future cash flow when originating consumer receivables we review the credit application the proposed contract term credit bureau information fico score and other information our evaluation emphasizes the applicant ability to pay and creditworthiness focusing on payment affordability and applicant credit history key consideration generally all customer in this portfolio have strong creditworthiness at loan origination after origination we review the credit quality of retail financing based on customer payment activity and aging analysis for all financing receivables we define past due any payment including principal and interest which is at least day past the contractual due date of december the majority of our financing receivables were at current status with only an immaterial balance being past due additionally of december the majority of our financing receivables excluding mypower note receivable were originated in we have customer note receivable under the legacy mypower loan program which provided residential customer with the option to finance the purchase of solar energy system through year loan and were all originated prior to year the outstanding balance net of any allowance for expected credit loss are presented on the consolidated balance sheet component of prepaid expense and other current asset for the current portion and other non current asset for the long term portion of december and the total outstanding balance of mypower customer note receivable net of allowance for expected credit loss wa million and million respectively of which million and million were due in the next month of december and

of credit risk consist of cash cash equivalent investment restricted cash account receivable and other finance receivables our cash and investment balance are primarily on deposit at high credit quality financial institution or invested in money market fund these deposit are typically in excess of insured limit of december and december no entity represented or more of our total receivables balance supply riskwe are dependent on our supplier including single source supplier and the inability of these supplier to deliver necessary component of our product in timely manner at price quality level and volume acceptable to or our inability to efficiently manage these component from these supplier could have material adverse effect on our business prospect financial condition and operating result inventory valuationinventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is computed using standard cost for vehicle and energy product which approximates actual cost on first in first out basis we record inventory write down for excess or obsolete inventory based upon assumption about current and future demand forecast if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amount are written off we also review our inventory to determine whether it carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicle le the estimated cost to convert the inventory on hand into finished product once inventory is written down new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent change in fact and circumstance do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis should our estimate of future selling price or production cost change additional and potentially material write down may be required small change in our estimate may result in material charge to our reported financial result operating lease vehiclesvehicles that are leased part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified operating lease vehicle at cost le accumulated depreciation we generally depreciate their cost le residual value using the straight line method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the contractual period the gross cost of operating lease vehicle of december and december wa billion and billion respectively operating lease vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet are presented net of accumulated depreciation of billion and million of december and december respectively digital asset netwe currently account for all digital asset held indefinite lived intangible asset in accordance with asc intangible goodwill and other we have ownership of and control over our digital asset and we may use third party custodial service to secure it the digital asset are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently remeasured on the consolidated balance sheet at cost net of any impairment loss incurred since acquisition we determine the fair value of our digital asset on nonrecurring basis in accordance with asc fair value measurement asc based on quoted price on the active exchange that we have determined is the principal market for such asset level input we perform an analysis each quarter to identify whether event or change in circumstance principally decrease in the quoted price on active exchange indicate that it is more likely than not that our digital asset are impaired in determining if an impairment ha occurred we consider the lowest market price of one unit of digital asset quoted on the active exchange since acquiring the digital asset when the then current carrying value of digital asset exceeds the fair value determined each quarter an impairment loss ha occurred with respect to those digital asset in the amount equal to the difference between their carrying value and the price determined impairment loss are recognized within restructuring and other in the consolidated statement of operation in the period in which the impairment is identified gain are not recorded until realized upon sale at which point they are presented net of any impairment loss for the same digital asset held within restructuring and other in determining the gain to be recognized upon sale we calculate the difference between the sale price and carrying value of the digital asset sold immediately prior to sale see note digital asset net for further information regarding digital asset solar energy system netwe are the lessor of solar energy system solar energy system are stated at cost le accumulated depreciation depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the respective asset follows solar energy system in service to year initial direct cost related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition cost lease term up to year solar energy system pending interconnection will be depreciated solar energy system in service when they have been interconnected and placed in service solar energy system under construction represents system that are under installation which will be depreciated solar energy system in service when they are completed interconnected and placed in service initial direct cost related to customer solar energy system agreement acquisition cost are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer agreement property plant and equipment netproperty plant and equipment net including leasehold improvement are recognized at cost le accumulated depreciation depreciation is generally computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the respective asset follows machinery equipment vehicle and office furniture to year tooling to year building and building improvement to year computer equipment and software to year leasehold improvement are depreciated on straight line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the term of the related lease upon the retirement or sale of our property plant and equipment the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operation maintenance and repair expenditure are expensed incurred while major improvement that increase the functionality output or expected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified useful life interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant capital asset construction capitalized interest on construction in progress is included within property plant and equipment net and is amortized over the life of the related asset long lived asset including acquired intangible assetswe review our property plant and equipment solar energy system long term prepayment and intangible asset for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable we measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flow that the asset is expected to generate if the asset is not recoverable it carrying amount would be adjusted down to it fair value for the year ended december and we have recognized no material impairment of our long lived asset intangible asset with definite life are amortized on straight line basis over their estimated useful life which range from three to thirty year goodwillwe ass goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if event or change in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired by comparing it carrying value to the reporting unit fair value for the year ended december and we not recognize any impairment of goodwill capitalization of software costswe capitalize cost incurred in the development of internal use software during the application development stage to property plant and equipment net on the consolidated balance sheet cost related to preliminary project activity and post implementation activity are expensed incurred such cost are amortized on straight line basis over it estimated useful life of three year software development cost incurred in development of software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility and prior to the general availability of the software are capitalized when they are expected to become significant such cost are amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable software once it is made generally available to our customer we evaluate the useful life of these asset on an annual basis and we test for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance occur that could impact the recoverability of these asset for the year ended december and we have recognized no impairment of capitalized software cost foreign currencywe determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiary and their operating division based on the primary currency in which they operate in case where the functional currency is not the dollar we recognize cumulative translation adjustment created by the different rate we apply to current period income or loss and the balance sheet for each subsidiary we apply the monthly average functional exchange rate to it monthly income or loss and the month end functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet foreign currency transaction gain and loss are result of the effect of exchange rate change on transaction denominated in currency other than the functional currency transaction gain and loss are recognized in other expense income net in the consolidated statement of operation for the year ended december and we recorded net foreign currency transaction loss of million gain of million and loss of million respectively warrantieswe provide manufacturer warranty on all new and used vehicle and warranty on the installation and component of the energy generation and storage system we sell for period typically between to year we accrue warranty reserve for the product sold by which includes our best estimate of the projected cost to repair or replace item under warranty and recall if identified these estimate are based on actual claim incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and cost of future claim these estimate are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sale and change to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material change to the warranty reserve in the future the warranty reserve doe not include projected warranty cost associated with our vehicle subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy system under lease contract or ppas the cost to repair these warranty claim are expensed incurred the portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next month is included within accrued liability and other while the remaining balance is included within other long term liability on the consolidated balance sheet warranty expense is recorded component of cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operation due to the magnitude of our automotive business accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment accrued warranty activity consisted of the following in million year ended december accrued warranty beginning of period warranty cost incurred net change in liability for pre existing warranty including expiration and foreign exchange impact provision for warranty accrued warranty end of period customer depositscustomer deposit primarily consist of cash payment from customer at the time they place an order or reservation for vehicle or an energy product and any additional payment up to the point of delivery or the completion of installation customer deposit also include prepayment on contract that can be cancelled without significant penalty such vehicle maintenance plan customer deposit amount vary depending on the vehicle model the energy product and the country of delivery with the exception of nominal order fee customer deposit are fully refundable on vehicle prior to delivery and fully refundable in the case of an energy generation or storage product prior to the entry into purchase agreement or in certain case for limited time thereafter in accordance with applicable law customer deposit are included in current

those fiscal year adoption of the asu should be applied prospectively early adoption is also permitted including adoption in an interim period if early adopted the amendment are applied retrospectively to all business combination for which the acquisition date occurred during the fiscal year of adoption this asu is currently not expected to have material impact on our consolidated financial statement in march the fasb issued asu troubled debt restructurings and vintage disclosure this asu eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditor that have adopted asu measurement of credit loss on financial instrument which we adopted on january this asu also enhances the disclosure requirement for certain loan refinancing and restructurings by creditor when borrower is experiencing financial difficulty in addition the asu amends the guidance on vintage disclosure to require entity to disclose current period gross write offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investment in lease within the scope of asc the asu is effective for annual period beginning after december including interim period within those fiscal year adoption of the asu would be applied prospectively early adoption is also permitted including adoption in an interim period this asu is currently not expected to have material impact on our consolidated

pronouncementsin december the fasb issued asu no deferral of the sunset date of reference rate reform topic topic provides optional expedient and exception for applying gaap to transaction affected by reference rate libor reform if certain criterion are met for limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for or recognizing the effect of reference rate reform on financial reporting the asu deferred the sunset date of topic from december to december the asu is effective of december through december we continue to evaluate transaction or contract modification occurring result of reference rate reform and determine whether to apply the optional guidance on an ongoing basis we adopted asu during the asu ha not and is currently not expected to have material impact on our consolidated financial statement in november the fasb issued asu no government assistance topic this asu requires business entity to disclose information about government assistance they receive if the transaction were accounted for by analogy to either grant or contribution accounting model the disclosure requirement include the nature of the transaction and the related accounting policy used the line item on the balance sheet and statement of operation that are affected and the amount applicable to each financial statement line item and the significant term and condition of the

amendment that are reflected in the financial statement at the date of initial application and new transaction that are entered into after the date of initial application we adopted the asu prospectively on january adoption of this asu did not have material impact on our consolidated financial statement asu august the fasb issued asu accounting for convertible instrument and contract in an entity own equity the asu simplifies the accounting for convertible instrument by removing certain separation model in asc debt debt with conversion and other option for convertible instrument the asu update the guidance on certain embedded conversion feature that are not required to be accounted for derivative under topic derivative and hedging or that do not result in substantial premium accounted for paid in capital such that those feature are no longer required to be separated from the host contract the convertible debt instrument will be accounted for single liability measured at amortized cost this will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible debt instrument to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when applying the guidance in topic interest further the asu made amendment to the eps guidance in topic for convertible debt instrument the most significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if converted method for diluted eps calculation and no longer allowing the net share settlement method the asu also made revision to topic which provides guidance on how an entity must determine whether contract qualifies for scope exception from derivative accounting the amendment to topic change the scope of contract that are recognized asset or liability on january we adopted the asu using the modified retrospective method we recognized cumulative effect of initially applying the asu an adjustment to the january opening balance of accumulated deficit due to the recombination of the equity conversion component of our convertible debt remaining outstanding additional paid in capital and convertible senior note mezzanine equity were reduced the removal of the remaining debt discount recorded for this previous separation had the effect of increasing our net debt balance and the reduction of property plant and equipment wa related to previously capitalized interest the prior period consolidated financial

to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant such fair value is market based measurement that should be determined based on assumption that market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability the three tiered fair value hierarchy which prioritizes which input should be used in measuring fair value is comprised of level observable input such quoted price in active market level ii input other than quoted price in active market that are observable either directly or indirectly and level iii unobservable input for which there is little or no market data the fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value our asset and liability that were measured at fair value on recurring basis were follows in
