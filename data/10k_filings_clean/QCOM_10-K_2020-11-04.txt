uncertainty described below are not the only one we face additional risk and uncertainty not presently known to or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business result of operation cash flow and financial condition and require significant management time and attention in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline in addition to the risk and uncertainty set forth in the risk factor below entitled the recent coronavirus covid pandemic ha had an adverse effect on our business and result of operation and we expect it impact will continue at least in the near term many of the risk and uncertainty set forth in the other risk factor below are exacerbated by the covid pandemic government and business response thereto and any further resulting decline in the global business and economic environment and may be impacted by the extent and speed of the global economic recovery you should also consider the other information set forth in this annual report in evaluating our business and our prospect including but not limited to our financial statement and the related note and part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation reference to and or and and or should be read to include the others appropriate risk related to the coronavirus covid pandemicthe recent coronavirus covid pandemic ha had an adverse effect on our business and result of operation and we expect it impact will continue at least in the near term the rapid global spread of covid and the fear it ha created ha resulted in significant economic uncertainty significant decline in business and consumer confidence and global demand in the wireless industry among others global economic slowdown and ha led to global recession specifically the decline in demand for smartphones and other consumer device sold by our customer or licensee ha resulted in decreased demand for our integrated circuit product which are incorporated into such device and decrease in the royalty we earn on the licensing of our intellectual property which is dependent upon the number of such device sold that utilize our intellectual property we expect that demand for our product and demand for the product of our customer and licensee will continue to be negatively impacted in the near term further while to date we have not seen significant impact on our manufacturing facility or our supply chain the ability of our supplier to deliver on their commitment to or our ability to ship our product to our customer may be negatively impacted by the pandemic and or government response thereto such travel ban and restriction quarantine shelter in place and social distancing order declaration of state of emergency and shutdown although the spread of covid ha caused to modify our workforce practice such having the vast majority of our employee working from home we have not experienced significant negative impact to our business or result of however we could be negatively affected in the future if among others significant number of our employee or employee perform critical function become ill and or are quarantined the result of exposure to covid or if government policy restrict the ability of those employee to perform their critical function the covid pandemic could also impact our business result of operation and financial condition through delayed reduced or cancelled customer order the inability of our customer or licensee to purchase or pay for our product or technology the insolvency of key supplier customer or licensee delay in reporting or payment from our customer or licensee or failure by other counterparties additionally state or federal government may in the future increase corporate tax rate increase employer payroll tax obligation and or otherwise change tax law to pay for stimulus and other action that may be taken result of covid the degree to which the covid pandemic impact our future business result of operation and financial condition will depend on future development which are uncertain including but not limited to the duration spread and severity of the pandemic government response and other action to mitigate the spread of and to treat covid and when and to extent normal business economic and social activity and condition resume we are similarly unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic impact our customer licensee supplier and other partner and their financial condition but adverse effect on these party could also adversely affect finally the covid pandemic make it challenging for management to estimate the future performance of our business risk related to industry dynamic and competitionour revenue depend on our customer and licensee sale of product and service based on cdma ofdma and other communication technology including and customer demand for our product based on these technology we develop patent and commercialize technology and product based on cdma ofdma and other communication technology which are primarily wireless we depend on our customer and licensee to develop device and service based on these technology with value added feature to drive consumer demand for new and multimode device well and single mode device and to establish the selling price for such device further the timing of our shipment of our product is dependent on the timing of our customer and licensee deployment of new device and service based on these technology increasingly we also depend on operator of wireless network our customer and licensee and other third party to incorporate these technology into new device type and into industry and application beyond mobile such automotive and iot among others we have historically been successful during wireless technology transition including and now commercial deployment of network and device have begun and will continue however the timing and scale of such deployment in certain region have been and may in the future be delayed due to the covid pandemic we believe it is critical that we remain leader in technology development standardization intellectual property creation and technology licensing and that we develop commercialize and be leading supplier of integrated circuit product in order to sustain and grow our business long term our revenue and growth in revenue could be negatively impacted our business may be harmed and our substantial investment in these technology may not provide an adequate return if our customer and licensee revenue and sale of product particularly premium tier product and service using these technology and average selling price of such product decline due to for example the maturity of smartphone penetration in developed region and china our intellectual property and technical leadership included in the continued standardization effort is le than in and standard we are unable to drive the adoption of our product into network and device including device beyond mobile or consumer rate of replacement of smartphones and other computing device decline our industry is subject to intense competition in an environment of rapid technological change our success depends in part on our ability to adapt to such change and compete effectively and such change and competition could result in decreased demand for our product and technology or declining average selling price for our product or those of our customer or licensee our product and technology face significant competition we expect competition to increase our current competitor expand their product offering improve their product or reduce the price of their product part of strategy to maintain existing business and customer or attract new business and customer new opportunity develop and new competitor enter the industry competition in wireless communication is affected by various factor that include among others oem concentration vertical integration competition in certain geographic region government intervention or support of national industry or competitor the ability to maintain product differentiation the result of evolving industry standard and speed of technological change including the transition to smaller geometry process technology and the demand for always on always connected capability and value added feature that drive selling price and consumer demand for new and multimode device well and single mode device we anticipate that additional competitor will introduce product result of growth opportunity in wireless communication the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitor and technological and public policy change additionally the semiconductor industry ha experienced and may continue to experience consolidation which could result in significant change to the competitive landscape for example if any key supplier of technology and intellectual property to the semiconductor industry wa sold to one of our competitor it could negatively affect our ability to or license such technology and intellectual property in the future which could have wide ranging impact on our business and operation we expect that our future success will depend on among other factor our ability to differentiate our integrated circuit product with innovative technology across multiple product and feature modem radio frequency front end rffe including mmwave graphic and other processor camera and connectivity and with smaller geometry process technology that drive both performance and lower power consumption develop and offer integrated circuit product at competitive cost and price point to effectively cover all geographic region and all device tier continue to be leader in mobile and drive the adoption of our technology and integrated circuit product including rffe into the most popular device model and across broad spectrum of device in mobile such smartphones tablet laptop and other mobile computing device increase or accelerate adoption of our technology and product in industry segment or application outside of mobile including automotive and iot maintain or accelerate demand for our integrated circuit product at the premium device tier while also driving the adoption of our product into high mid and low tier device across all region remain leader in and technology development standardization intellectual property creation and licensing and develop commercialize and remain leading supplier of and integrated circuit product including rffe product create standalone value and contribute to the success of our existing business through acquisition joint venture and other transaction and by developing customer licensee vendor

effectively commercialize new device using these platform and continue to develop brand recognition to effectively compete against better known company in computing and other consumer driven segment and to deepen our presence in significant emerging region and china we compete with many different semiconductor company ranging from multinational company with integrated research and development manufacturing sale and marketing organization across broad spectrum of product line to company that are focused on single application industry segment or standard product including those that produce product for mobile automotive and iot among others most of these competitor compete with with respect to some but not all of our business company that design integrated circuit based on cdma ofdma wi fi or their derivative are generally competitor or potential competitor example some of which are strategic partner of ours in other area include broadcom hisilicon mediatek nvidia nxp semiconductor qorvo samsung skyworks texas instrument and unisoc formally known spreadtrum communication some of these current and potential competitor may have advantage over that include among others motivation by our customer in certain circumstance to use our competitor integrated circuit product to utilize their own internally developed integrated circuit product or sell such product to others or to utilize alternative technology lower cost structure or willingness and ability to accept lower price or lower margin for their product particularly in china foreign government support of other technology competitor or oems that sell device that do not contain our integrated circuit product better known brand name ownership and control of manufacturing facility and greater expertise in manufacturing process more extensive relationship with local distribution company and oems in certain geographic region such china more experience in adjacent industry segment or application beyond mobile such automotive and iot and more established presence in certain region in addition certain of our largest integrated circuit customer have in the past utilized currently utilize and may in the future utilize our competitor integrated circuit product in some or all of their device rather than our product further certain of those customer have developed are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit product effectively making them competitor which they have in the past utilized currently utilize and may in the future utilize in some or all of their device rather than our product see also the risk factor entitled our business particularly our semiconductor business may suffer result of our customer vertically integrating developing their own integrated circuit product further political action including trade and or national security protection policy or other action by government particularly the and chinese government have in the past currently are and could in the future limit or from transacting business with certain of our customer or supplier limit prevent or discourage certain of our customer or supplier from transacting business with or make it more expensive to do so this could advantage our competitor by enabling them with increased sale economy of scale operating income and or cash flow and or enable critical technology transfer allowing them to increase their investment in technology development research and development and commercialization of product see also the risk factor entitled significant portion of our business is concentrated in china and the risk of such concentration are exacerbated by china trade and national security tension further certain of our competitor develop and sell multiple component including integrated circuit product for use in device and sell those component together to oems our competitor sale of multiple component put and our discrete integrated circuit product at competitive disadvantage certain of our competitor also develop and sell infrastructure equipment for wireless network and can optimize their integrated circuit product to perform on such network to degree that we are not able to which put at competitive disadvantage competition in any or all product tier may result in the loss of business or customer which would negatively impact our business revenue result of operation cash flow and financial condition such competition may also reduce average selling price for our chipset product or the product of our customer and licensee certain of these dynamic are particularly pronounced in emerging region and china where competitor may have lower cost structure or may have willingness and ability to accept lower price or lower margin on their product reduction in the average selling price of our chipset product without corresponding increase in volume would negatively impact our revenue and without corresponding decrease in average unit cost would negatively impact our margin in addition reduction in the average selling price of our licensee product unless offset by an increase in volume would generally decrease total royalty payable to negatively impacting our licensing revenue risk related to our operating businesseswe derive significant portion of our revenue from small number of customer and licensee and particularly from their sale of premium tier device if revenue derived from these customer or licensee decrease or the timing of such revenue fluctuates our business and result of operation could be negatively affected we derive significant portion of our revenue from small number of customer and particularly from their sale of premium tier device and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future our industry is experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among few company particularly at the premium tier contributing to this trend chinese oems continue to grow their device share in china and are increasing their device share in region outside of china and we derive significant portion of our revenue from small number of these oems well in addition number of our largest integrated circuit customer have developed are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit product or may choose our competitor integrated circuit product which they have in the past utilized currently utilize and may in the future utilize in some or all of their device rather than our product which could significantly reduce the revenue we derive from these customer see also the risk factor entitled our business particularly our semiconductor business may suffer result of our customer vertically integrating developing their own integrated circuit product further political action including trade and or national security protection policy or other action by government particularly the and chinese government have in the past and could in the future limit or prevent from transacting business with some of our largest customer limit prevent or discourage those customer from transacting business with or make it more expensive to do so any of which could also significantly reduce the revenue we derive from these customer see also the risk factor entitled significant portion of our business is concentrated in china and the risk of such concentration are exacerbated by china trade and national security tension in addition we spend significant amount of engineering and development time fund and resource in understanding our key customer feedback and or specification and attempt to incorporate such input into our product launch and technology these effort may not require or result in purchase commitment from such customer or we may have lower purchase from such customer than expected and consequently we may not achieve the anticipated revenue from these effort or these effort may result in non recoverable cost the loss of any one of our significant customer reduction in the purchase of our product by such customer or the cancelation of significant purchase by any of these customer whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit product or our competitor integrated circuit product government restriction the covid pandemic or otherwise would reduce our revenue and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected result of operation and delay of significant purchase even if only temporary would reduce our revenue in the period of the delay any such reduction in revenue would also impact our cash resource available for other purpose such research and development further the concentration of device share among few company and the corresponding purchasing power of these company may result in lower price for our product which if not accompanied by sufficient increase in the volume of purchase of our product could have an adverse effect on our revenue and margin in addition the timing and size of purchase by our significant customer may be impacted by the timing of such customer new or next generation product introduction over which we have no control and the timing and success of such introduction may cause our revenue and result of operation to fluctuate purchase our mdm or thin modem product which do not include our integrated application processor technology and which have lower revenue and margin contribution than our combined modem and application processor product further to the extent apple take device share from our customer who purchase our integrated modem and application processor product our revenue and margin may be negatively impacted our industry ha also experienced and we expect it will continue to experience slowing growth in the premium tier device segment due to among other factor lengthening replacement cycle in developed region where premium tier smartphones are common increasing consumer demand in emerging region where premium tier smartphones are le common and replacement cycle are on average longer than in developed region and are continuing to lengthen and maturing premium tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launch and innovation cycle reduction in sale of premium tier device reduction in sale of our premium tier integrated circuit product which have higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower tier integrated circuit product or shift in share away from oems that utilize our premium tier product would reduce our revenue and margin and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial result any such reduction in revenue would also impact our cash resource available for other purpose such research and development although we have more than licensee we derive significant portion of our licensing revenue from limited number of licensee which includes small number of chinese oems in the event that one or more of our significant licensee fail to meet their reporting and payment obligation or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreement under similar term their existing agreement our revenue result of operation and cash flow would be adversely impacted moreover the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensee to develop introduce and deliver high volume product that achieve and sustain customer acceptance we do not have control over the product development sale effort or pricing of product by our licensee and our licensee might not be successful reduction in sale of our licensee product or reduction in the average selling price of wireless device sold by our licensee without sufficient increase in the volume of such device sold would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenue such adverse impact may be mitigated by our per unit royalty cap that apply to certain category of our licensee complete wireless device namely smartphones tablet laptop and smartwatches our business particularly our semiconductor business may suffer result of our customer vertically integrating developing their own integrated circuit product certain of our largest integrated circuit customer for example samsung develop their own integrated circuit product which they have in the past utilized and currently utilize in certain of their device and may in the future utilize in some or all of their device rather than our product and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit product to third party discretely or together with certain of their other product in competition with apple ha utilized modem product of one of our competitor in some of it device rather than our product and solely utilized one of our competitor product in several of it recent device launch in april we entered into new multi year chipset supply agreement with apple and began shipping modem under this agreement in the third quarter of fiscal in december apple acquired intel modem asset and is developing it own modem product using these asset accordingly apple is expected to use it own modem product rather than our product in some or all of it future device similarly we derive significant portion of our revenue from chinese oems certain of our customer in china have developed and others may in the future develop their own integrated circuit product and use such integrated circuit product in their device rather than our integrated circuit product including due to pressure from or policy of the chinese government whose made in china campaign target semiconductor self sufficiency by concern over losing access to our integrated circuit product result of actual threatened or potential or chinese government action or policy including trade protection or national security policy or other reason if some or all of our largest customer and or the largest smartphone oems utilize their own integrated circuit modem product in some or all of their device rather than our product our business revenue result of operation cash flow and financial position could be materially adversely impacted see also the risk factor entitled we derive significant portion of our revenue from small number of customer and licensee and particularly from their sale of premium tier device if revenue derived from these customer or licensee decrease or the timing of such revenue fluctuates our business and result of operation could be negatively affected significant portion of our business is concentrated in china and the risk of such concentration are exacerbated by china trade and national security tension we derive significant portion of our revenue from chinese oems and from non chinese oems that utilize our integrated circuit product in their device and sell those device into china which ha the largest number of smartphone user in the world we also source certain critical integrated circuit product from supplier in china due to various factor including pressure encouragement or incentive from or policy of the chinese government including it made in china campaign concern over losing access to our integrated circuit product result of actual threatened or potential or chinese government action or policy including trade protection or national security or other reason some of our chinese integrated circuit customer have developed and others may in the future develop their own integrated circuit product and use such integrated circuit product in their device or use our competitor integrated circuit product in their device rather than our product political action including trade protection and national security policy of the and chinese government such tariff ban or placing company on restricted entity list have in the past currently are and could in the future limit or prevent from transacting business with certain of our chinese customer or supplier limit prevent or discourage certain of our chinese customer or supplier from transacting business with or make it more expensive to do so given our revenue concentration in china if due to actual threatened or potential or chinese government action or policy we were further limited in or prohibited from obtaining critical integrated circuit product from supplier in china or selling our integrated circuit product to chinese oems if our non chinese oem customer were limited in or prohibited from selling device into china that incorporate our integrated circuit product if chinese oems develop and use their own integrated circuit product or use our competitor integrated circuit product in some or all of their device rather than our integrated circuit product if chinese tariff on our integrated circuit product or on device which incorporate our integrated circuit product made purchasing such product or device more expensive to chinese oems or chinese consumer or if our chinese licensee delay or cease making payment of license fee they owe our business revenue result of operation cash flow and financial position could be materially harmed finally government policy in china that regulate the amount and timing of fund that may flow of the country have impacted and may continue to impact the timing of our receipt of and or ability to receive payment from our customer and licensee in china which may negatively impact our cash flow risk specific to our licensing business effort by some oems to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalty for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resource and may result in legal decision or action by government court regulator or agency standard development organization sdos or other industry organization that harm our business from time to time company initiate various strategy to attempt to negotiate renegotiate reduce and or eliminate their need to pay royalty to for the use of our intellectual property these strategy have included litigation often alleging infringement of patent held by such company patent misuse patent exhaustion patent invalidity or unenforceability of our patent or license alleging that we do not license our patent on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory frand term or alleging some form of unfair competition or competition law violation ii taking position contrary to our understanding and or the plain language of their contract with iii appeal to governmental authority iv collective action including working with wireless operator standard body other like minded company and organization on both formal and informal base to adopt intellectual property policy and practice that could have the effect of limiting return on intellectual property innovation lobbying governmental regulator and elected official for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rate or the base on which royalty are calculated seeking to impose some form of compulsory licensing or weakening patent holder ability to enforce it right or obtain fair return for such right and vi attempt by licensee to shift their royalty obligation to their supplier in order to lower the wholesale licensee selling price on which the royalty is calculated in addition certain licensee have disputed underreported underpaid not reported or not paid royalty owed to under their license agreement or reported to in manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligation and certain company have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreement with for their use of our intellectual property and they or others may engage in such behavior in the future the fact that one or more licensee dispute underreport underpay do not report or do not pay royalty owed to may encourage other licensee to take similar action or not renew their existing license agreement and may encourage other licensee or unlicensed company to delay entering into or to not enter into new license agreement further to the extent such licensee and company increase their device share the negative impact of their underreporting underpayment non payment or non reporting on our business revenue result of operation cash flow and financial condition will be exacerbated we have been in the past and are currently subject to various litigation and governmental investigation and proceeding certain of these matter are described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency we may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigation or proceeding in the future additionally certain of our direct and indirect customer and licensee have pursued and others may in the future pursue litigation or arbitration against related to our business unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matter have had and could in the future have material adverse effect on our business revenue result of operation cash flow and financial condition see also the risk factor below entitled our business may suffer result of adverse ruling in government investigation or proceeding and change in our patent licensing practice whether due to governmental investigation or private legal proceeding challenging those practice or otherwise could adversely impact our business and result of operation in addition in connection with our participation in sdos we like other patent owner generally have made contractual commitment to such organization to license those of our patent that would necessarily be infringed by standard compliant product set forth in those commitment some manufacturer and user of standard compliant product advance of these commitment that are adverse to our licensing business including interpretation that would limit the amount of royalty that we could collect on the licensing of our standard essential patent portfolio further some company or entity have proposed significant change to existing intellectual property policy for implementation by sdos and other industry organization with the goal of significantly devaluing standard essential patent for example some have put forth proposal which would require maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard essential patent owned by all of the member company to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard they have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard essential patent based upon the number of standard essential patent held by such company others have proposed that injunction should not be an available remedy for infringement of standard essential patent and have made proposal that could severely limit damage award and other remedy by court for patent infringement by severely limiting the base upon which the royalty rate may be applied number of these strategy are purportedly based on interpretation of the policy of certain sdos concerning the licensing of patent that are or may be essential to industry standard and on our or other company alleged failure to abide by these policy some sdos court and governmental agency have adopted and may in the future adopt some or all of these interpretation or proposal in manner adverse to our interest including in litigation to which we may not be party we expect that such proposal interpretation and strategy will continue in the future and if successful our business model would be harmed either by limiting or eliminating our ability to collect royalty or by reducing the royalty we can collect on all or portion of our standard essential patent portfolio limiting our return on investment with respect to new technology limiting our ability to seek injunction against infringers of our standard essential patent constraining our ability to make licensing commitment when submitting our technology for inclusion in future standard which could make our technology le likely to be included in such standard or forcing to work outside of sdos or other industry group to promote our new technology and our revenue result of operation and cash flow could be negatively impacted in addition the legal and other cost associated with asserting or defending our position have been and continue to be significant we expect that such challenge regardless of their merit will continue into the foreseeable future and will require the investment of substantial management time and financial resource change in our patent licensing practice whether due to governmental investigation or private legal proceeding challenging those practice or otherwise could adversely impact our business and result of operation described in the risk factor our business may suffer result of adverse ruling in government investigation or proceeding below we have been in the past and are currently subject to various governmental investigation and proceeding well private legal proceeding challenging our patent licensing and chipset sale practice certain of these matter are described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency we believe that one intent of certain of these investigation and legal proceeding ha been to reduce the amount of royalty that licensee are required to pay to for their use of our intellectual property we may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigation or proceeding in the future if we were required to reduce the royalty rate in our patent license agreement our revenue earnings and cash flow would be negatively impacted absent sufficient increase in the volume of sale of device upon which royalty are paid similarly if we were required to reduce the base on which our royalty are calculated our revenue result of operation and cash flow would be negatively impacted unless there wa sufficient increase in the volume of sale of device upon which royalty are paid or we were able to increase our royalty rate to offset the decrease in revenue resulting from such lower royalty base assuming the absolute royalty dollar were below any relevant royalty cap if we were required to grant patent license to chipset manufacturer which could lead to implementing more complex multi level licensing structure in which we license certain portion of our patent portfolio to chipset manufacturer and other portion to oems we would incur additional transaction cost which may be significant and we could incur delay in recognizing revenue license negotiation were completed in addition our licensing revenue and earnings would be negatively impacted if we were not able to obtain in the aggregate equivalent revenue under such multi level licensing structure if we were required to sell chipsets to oems that do not have license to our patent our licensing program could be negatively impacted by patent exhaustion claim raised by such unlicensed oems claim that our sale of chipsets to such oems forecloses from asserting any patent substantially embodied by the chipsets against such oems such sale would provide oems with defense in the event we asserted our patent against them to obtain licensing revenue for those patent this could have material adverse effect on our licensing program and our result of operation cash flow and financial condition to the extent that we were required to implement any of these new licensing and or business practice including by modifying or renegotiating our existing license agreement or pursuing other commercial arrangement we would incur additional transaction cost which may be significant we could incur delay in recognizing revenue until license negotiation were completed and our business revenue result of operation cash flow and financial condition could be harmed the impact of any such change to our licensing practice could vary widely and by jurisdiction depending on the specific outcome and the geographic scope of such outcome in addition if we were required to make modification to our licensing practice in one jurisdiction licensee or governmental agency in other jurisdiction may attempt to obtain similar outcome for or for such other jurisdiction applicable continued and future success of our licensing program requires to continue to evolve our patent portfolio and to renew or renegotiate license agreement that are expiring or to cover additional future patent we own very strong portfolio of issued and pending patent related to and other technology it is critical that we continue to evolve our patent portfolio particularly in if we do not maintain strong portfolio that is applicable to current and future standard product and service our future licensing revenue could be negatively impacted further the license granted to and from under number of our license agreement include only patent that are either filed or issued prior to certain date result there are agreement with some licensee where later patent are not licensed by or to additionally our patent license agreement in effect that constitute significant portion of our licensing revenue are effective for specified term in order to license or to obtain license to such later patent or after the expiration of the specified term and to receive royalty after the expiration date of the specified term we will need to extend or modify such license agreement or enter into new license agreement with such licensee more frequently than we have done historically we might not be able to extend or modify license agreement or enter into new license agreement in the future without negatively affecting the material term and condition of our license agreement with such licensee and such modification or new agreement may negatively impact our revenue in some circumstance we may extend modify or enter into new license agreement result of arbitration or litigation and term imposed by arbitrator or court may be le favorable to than existing term and may impact the financial or other term of license agreement not subject to the litigation or arbitration if there is delay in extending modifying or entering into new license agreement with licensee there would be delay in our ability to recognize revenue related to that licensee product sale further if we are unable to reach agreement on such modification or new agreement it could result in patent infringement litigation with such company risk related to regulatory and legal challenge our business may suffer result of adverse ruling in government investigation or proceeding we have been in the past and are currently subject to various governmental investigation and proceeding certain of these matter are described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency key allegation or finding in those matter include among others that we violate frand licensing commitment by refusing to grant license to chipset manufacturer that our royalty rate are high that the base on which our royalty are calculated should be something le than the wholesale licensee selling price of the applicable device minus certain permitted deduction that we unlawfully require customer to execute patent license we sell them cellular modem chipsets that we have entered into exclusive agreement with chipset customer that foreclose competition that we leverage our position in baseband chipsets in the rffe space and that we violate antitrust law engage in anticompetitive conduct and unfair method of competition we may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigation or proceeding in the future unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matter have had and could in the future have material adverse effect on our business revenue result of operation cash flow and financial condition depending on the matter various remedy that could result from an unfavorable resolution include among others the loss of our ability to enforce one or more of our patent injunction monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money the issuance of order to cease certain conduct or modify our business practice such requiring to reduce our royalty rate reduce the base on which our royalty are calculated grant patent license to chipset manufacturer sell chipsets to unlicensed oems or modify or renegotiate some or all of our existing license agreement and determination that some or all of our license agreement are invalid or unenforceable if some or all of our license agreement are declared invalid or unenforceable and or we are required to renegotiate these license agreement we may not receive or may not be able to recognize some or any licensing or royalty revenue under the impacted license agreement unless and until we enter into new license agreement and even licensee whose license agreement are not impacted may demand to renegotiate their agreement or invoke the dispute resolution provision in their agreement and we may not be able to recognize some or any licensing or royalty revenue under such agreement the renegotiation of license agreement could result in term which are le favorable to than existing term or lead to arbitration or litigation to resolve the licensing term which could also be le favorable to than existing term and each of which could take month or possibly year licensee may underreport underpay not report or not pay royalty owed to pending the conclusion of such negotiation arbitration or litigation in addition we may be sued for alleged overpayment of past royalty paid to including private antitrust action seeking treble damage under antitrust law the occurrence of any of the above could have material adverse effect on our business revenue result of operation cash flow and financial condition and our stock price could decline possibly significantly in which case we may have to significantly cut cost and other us of cash including in research and development significantly impairing our ability to maintain product and technology leadership and invest in next generation technology such further depending on the breadth and severity of the circumstance above we may have to reduce suspend or eliminate our capital return program and our ability to timely pay our indebtedness may be impacted in addition governmental body in particular country or region may successfully assert and impose remedy with effect that extend beyond the border of that country or region these challenge have required and we expect that they will continue to require the investment of significant management time and attention and have resulted and we expect that they will continue to result in significant legal cost until the respective matter are resolved related to supply and manufacturing we depend on limited number of third party supplier for the procurement manufacture and testing of our product manufactured in fable production model if we fail to execute supply strategy that provide supply assurance technology leadership and reasonable margin our business and result of operation may be harmed we are also subject to order and shipment uncertainty that could negatively impact our result of operation we primarily utilize fable production model which mean that we do not own or operate foundry for the production of silicon wafer from which our integrated circuit are made other than the facility we own that manufacture certain of our rffe module and rf filter product we rely on third party supplier to perform the manufacturing and assembly and most of the testing of our integrated circuit our supplier are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw material used in the production of our integrated circuit there are limited number of such third party supplier and even fewer who are capable of manufacturing at the leading process technology node we employ both turnkey and two stage manufacturing model to purchase our integrated circuit under the turnkey model our foundry supplier are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuit under the two stage manufacturing model we purchase die in singular or wafer form from semiconductor manufacturing foundry and contract with separate third party supplier for manufacturing service such wafer bump probe assembly and the majority of our final test requirement the semiconductor manufacturing foundry that supply our product are primarily located in asia are our primary warehouse where we store finished good for fulfillment of customer order the following could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and negatively impact our revenue business operation profitability and cash flow reduction interruption delay or limitation in our product supply source failure by our supplier to procure raw material or allocate adequate raw material for our product failure by our supplier to allocate adequate manufacturing or test capacity for our product our supplier inability to react to shift in product demand or an increase in raw material or component price our supplier inability to develop or maintain or delay in developing or building out manufacturing capacity for leading process technology including transition to smaller geometry process technology the loss of supplier or the inability of supplier to meet performance quality or yield specification or delivery schedule additional expense or production delay result of qualifying new supplier and commencing volume production or testing in the event of loss of or decision to add or change supplier natural disaster or geopolitical conflict impacting our supplier health crisis including epidemic or pandemic such the covid pandemic and government and business response thereto which impact our supplier including result of quarantine or closure and trade or national security protection policy particularly or chinese government policy that limit or prevent from transacting business with supplier of critical integrated circuit product or that limit or prevent such supplier from transacting business with or from procuring material machinery or technology necessary to manufacture good for while we have established alternate supplier for certain technology there are limited number of such supplier and even fewer who are capable of operating at the leading process technology node we rely on sole or limited source supplier for certain product which may exacerbate the aforementioned risk or subject to other significant risk including poor product performance and reduced control over delivery schedule manufacturing capability and yield quality assurance quantity and cost to the extent we have established alternate supplier these supplier may require significant level of time and support to bring such technology to production both of which may increase for complex or leading process technology result we may invest significant amount of effort and resource and incur higher cost to support and maintain such alternate supplier further any future consolidation of foundry supplier or limitation in foundry supplier ability to manufacture product for due to trade or national security protection policy could increase our vulnerability to sole or limited source arrangement and reduce our supplier willingness to negotiate pricing which could negatively impact our ability to achieve cost reduction and could increase our manufacturing cost and limit the amount of capacity available to our arrangement with our supplier may obligate to incur cost to manufacture and test our product that do not decrease at the same rate decrease in pricing to our customer our ability and that of our supplier to develop or maintain leading process technology including transition to smaller geometry process technology which add risk to manufacturing yield and reliability and to effectively compete with the manufacturing process and performance of our competitor could impact our ability to introduce new product and meet customer demand could increase our cost possibly decreasing our margin and could subject to the risk of excess inventory any of the above could negatively impact our business result of operation and cash flow although we have long term contract with our supplier most of these contract do not provide for long term capacity commitment to the extent we do not have firm commitment from our supplier over specific time period or for any quantity our supplier may allocate and in the past have allocated capacity to the production and testing of product for their other customer while reducing or limiting capacity to manufacture or test our product and such capacity may be limited based on our supplier ability and willingness to invest in the capital required to manufacture in the leading process technology accordingly capacity for our product may not be available when we need it or at reasonable price to the extent we do obtain long term capacity commitment we may incur additional cost related to those commitment or make non refundable payment for capacity commitment that are not used our supplier or potential alternate supplier may manufacture cdma or ofdma based integrated circuit for themselves or for other company that compete with our product such supplier have in the past and could again elect to allocate raw material and manufacturing capacity to their own product or product of our competitor and reduce or limit the production of our product in addition we may not receive reasonable pricing manufacturing or delivery term from our supplier we can not guarantee that the action of our supplier will not cause disruption in our operation that could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligation to our customer or increase our cost of sale to the extent we are unable to obtain adequate supply we may be obligated to make payment to our customer for such shortfall additionally we place order with our supplier using our and our customer forecast of demand for our product which are based on number of assumption and estimate we move to smaller geometry process technology the manufacturing lead time increase result the order we place with our supplier are generally only partially covered by commitment from our customer if we or our customer overestimate demand or if demand is impacted by factor outside of our or our customer control such the covid pandemic that is not under binding commitment from our customer we may experience increased excess or obsolete inventory which would negatively impact our result of operation there are numerous risk associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facility including higher portion of fixed cost relative to fable model environmental compliance and liability impact related to climate change exposure to natural disaster timely supply of equipment and material and various manufacturing issue we own and operate various facility that manufacture certain of our rffe module and rf filter product manufacturing facility are characterized by higher portion of fixed cost relative to fable model we may be faced with decline in the utilization rate of our manufacturing facility due to decrease in demand for our product including in le favorable industry environment during such period our manufacturing facility could operate at lower capacity level while the fixed cost associated with such facility would continue to be incurred resulting in lower gross profit we are subject to many environmental health and safety law and regulation in each jurisdiction in which we operate our manufacturing facility which govern among other thing emission of pollutant into the air wastewater discharge the use storage generation handling and disposal of hazardous substance and other waste the investigation and remediation of soil and ground water contamination and the health and safety of our employee certain environmental law impose strict and in certain circumstance joint and several liability on current or previous owner or operator of real property or party who arranged for hazardous substance to be sent to disposal or treatment facility for the cost of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substance result we may incur clean up cost in connection with any such removal or remediation effort well other third party claim in connection with contaminated site in addition we could be held liable for consequence arising out of human exposure to hazardous substance or other environmental damage if we or company or facility we acquire or have acquired in the past failed or in the future fail to comply with any such law and regulation we could incur liability fine or prohibition on the sale of product we manufacture and our operation could be suspended such law and regulation could also restrict our ability to modify or expand our facility could require to acquire costly equipment or could require other significant expenditure we are also required to obtain and maintain environmental permit from governmental authority for certain of our operation while we have policy and procedure designed to ensure compliance with applicable law regulation and permit we can not make assurance that we or our employee contractor or agent will at all time be in compliance with such law regulation and permit or our related policy and procedure climate change concern and the potential resulting environmental impact may result in new environmental health and safety law and regulation that may affect our supplier and our customer such law or regulation could cause to incur additional direct cost for compliance well increased indirect cost resulting from our customer supplier or both incurring additional compliance cost that are passed on to these cost may adversely impact our result of operation and financial condition in addition climate change may pose physical risk to our manufacturing facility or our supplier facility including increased extreme weather event that could result in supply delay or disruption we have manufacturing facility in asia and europe if tsunami flooding earthquake volcanic eruption or other natural disaster effect of climate change or geopolitical conflict were to damage destroy or disrupt our manufacturing facility it could disrupt our operation delay production and shipment of inventory and result in costly repair replacement or other cost in addition natural disaster effect of climate change or geopolitical conflict may result in disruption in transportation distribution channel and supply chain and significant increase in the price of raw material further health crisis including epidemic or pandemic such the covid pandemic and government and business response thereto could affect our manufacturing facility including by resulting in quarantine and or closure which would result in disruption to and potential closure of our manufacturing operation manufacturing operation depend on securing raw material and other supply in adequate quality and quantity in timely manner from multiple supplier and in some case we rely on limited number of supplier particularly in asia accordingly there may be case where supply of raw material and other product are interrupted by disaster accident or some other event at supplier supply is suspended due to quality or other issue or there is shortage of supply due to rapid increase in demand among others which could impact production and prevent from supplying our product to our customer if the supply demand balance is disrupted it may considerably increase cost of manufacturing due to increased price we pay for raw material from time to time supplier may extend lead time limit amount supplied to or increase price due to capacity constraint or other factor additionally supply and cost of raw material may be negatively impacted by trade and or national security protection policy such tariff or action by government that limit or prevent from transacting business with certain company or that limit or prevent certain company from transacting business with or trade tension particularly with country in asia further it may be difficult or impossible to substitute one piece of equipment for another or replace one type of material with another failure by our supplier to deliver our requirement could result in disruption to our manufacturing operation our manufacturing process are highly complex require advanced and costly equipment and must be continuously modified to improve yield and performance difficulty in the production process can reduce yield or interrupt production and result we may not be able to deliver our product or do so in timely cost effective or competitive manner further to remain competitive and meet customer demand we may be required to improve our facility and process technology and carry out extensive research and development each of which may require investment of significant amount of capital and may have material adverse effect on our result of operation cash flow and financial condition finally we typically begin manufacturing our product using our or our customer forecast of demand for our product which are based on number of assumption and estimate and are generally not covered by purchase commitment result we incur inventory and manufacturing cost in advance of anticipated sale which sale ultimately may not materialize or may be lower than expected if we or our customer overestimate demand or if demand is impacted by factor outside of our or our customer control such the covid pandemic or trade or national security protection policy that is not under binding commitment from our customer we may experience higher inventory carrying and operating cost and or increased excess or obsolete inventory which would negatively impact our result of operation risk related to new and adjacent initiative our growth depends in part on our ability to extend our technology and product into new and expanded product area and adjacent industry segment or application beyond mobile our research development and other investment in these new and expanded product area industry segment or application and related technology and product well in our existing technology and product and new technology may not generate operating income or contribute to future result of operation that meet our expectation while we continue to invest significant resource toward advancement primarily in support of and based technology we also invest in new and expanded product area and adjacent industry segment or application by utilizing our existing technical and business expertise and through acquisition in particular our future growth depends in part on new and expanded product area such rffe and adjacent industry segment or application beyond mobile such automotive and iot our ability to develop leading and cost effective technology and product for new and expanded product area adjacent industry segment or application and third party incorporating our technology and product into device used in these product area industry segment or application accordingly we intend to continue to make substantial investment in these new and expanded product area and adjacent industry segment or application and in developing new product and technology for these product area industry segment or application our growth also depends significantly on our ability to develop and patent technology and to develop and commercialize product using technology however our research development and other investment in these new and expanded product area and adjacent industry segment or application and corresponding technology and product well in our existing technology and product and new technology such use of licensed shared and unlicensed spectrum and convergence of cellular and wi fi may not succeed because among other reason we may not be issued patent on the technology we develop the technology we develop may not be incorporated into relevant standard new and expanded product area adjacent industry segment or application and consumer demand therein may not develop or grow anticipated our strategy or the strategy of our customer licensee or partner may not be successful alternate technology may be better or may reduce the advantage we anticipate from our investment competitor technology or product may be more cost effective have more capability or fewer limitation or are brought to market faster than our new technology or product we may not be able to develop or our competitor may have more established and or stronger customer vendor distributor or other channel relationship and competitor may have longer operating history in industry segment or application that are new to we may also underestimate the cost of or overestimate the future revenue or margin that could result from these investment and these investment may not or may take many year to generate material return further the automotive industry is subject to long design in time frame long product life cycle and high degree of regulatory and safety requirement necessitating supplier to the industry to comply with stringent qualification process very low defect rate and high reliability standard all of which result in significant barrier to entry and increased cost our new technology and product are not successful or are not successful in the time frame we anticipate we may incur significant cost and asset impairment our business and revenue may not grow or grow anticipated our revenue and margin may be negatively impacted our stock price may decline and our reputation may be harmed we may engage in strategic acquisition and other transaction or make investment or be unable to consummate planned strategic acquisition which could adversely affect our result of operation or fail to enhance stockholder value we engage in strategic acquisition and other transaction including joint venture and make investment which we believe are important to the future of our business with the goal of maximizing stockholder value from time to time we acquire business and other asset including patent technology and other intangible asset enter into joint venture or other strategic transaction and purchase minority equity interest in or make loan to company including those that may be private and early stage our strategic activity are generally focused on opening or expanding opportunity for our product and technology and supporting the design and introduction of new product or enhancing existing product for mobile and for new industry segment or application beyond mobile many of our strategic activity entail high degree of risk and require the use of significant amount of capital and investment may not become liquid for several year after the date of the investment if at all our strategic activity may not generate financial return or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technology or product we may underestimate the cost or overestimate the benefit including product revenue cost and other synergy and growth opportunity that we expect to realize and we may not achieve those benefit in some case we may be required to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or loss of company in which we have acquired ownership interest in addition we have in the past and may record impairment charge in the future related to our strategic activity any loss or impairment charge that we incur related to strategic activity will have negative impact on our result of operation and financial condition and we may continue to incur new or additional loss related to strategic asset or investment that we have not fully impaired or exited achieving the anticipated benefit of business acquisition including joint venture and other strategic investment in which we have management and operational control depends in part upon our ability to integrate the business in an efficient and effective manner and achieve anticipated synergy and we may not be successful in these effort such integration is complex and time consuming and involves significant challenge including among others retaining key employee successfully integrating new employee facility technology product process operation including supply and manufacturing operation sale and distribution channel business model and business system retaining customer and supplier of the business consolidating research and development operation minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business matter consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructure and managing the increased scale complexity and globalization of our business operation and employee base we may not derive any commercial value from associated technology or product or from future technology or product based on these technology and we may be subject to liability that are not covered by indemnification protection that we may obtain and we may become subject to litigation additionally we may not be successful in entering or expanding into new sale or distribution channel business or operational model geographic region industry segment or application served by or adjacent to the associated business or in addressing potential new opportunity that may arise out of our strategic acquisition if we do not achieve the anticipated benefit of business acquisition or other strategic activity our business and result of operation may be adversely affected and we may not enhance stockholder value by engaging in these transaction many of our acquisition and other strategic investment require approval by the united state and foreign government agency certain agency in the past have and may in the future deny the transaction or fail to approve in timely manner resulting in not realizing the anticipated benefit of the proposed transaction future acquisition or other strategic investment may be more difficult complex or expensive to the extent that our reputation for our ability to consummate acquisition ha been harmed further if china relation remain strained our ability to consummate any transaction that would require approval from the relevant regulatory agency in china may be severely impacted risk related to cybersecurity or misappropriation of our critical information our business and operation could suffer in the event of security breach of our information technology system or other misappropriation of our technology intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information third party regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to our information technology system and many such attempt are increasingly more sophisticated the perception that the covid pandemic ha made company information technology system more vulnerable ha increased the already significant volume of such attempt these attempt which might be related to industrial corporate or other espionage criminal hacker or state sponsored intrusion include trying to covertly introduce malware to our computer and network including those in our manufacturing operation and impersonating authorized user among others we may also be subject to ransom style cyber attack which could impact our information technology system and cause widespread disruption to our business including our manufacturing operation and expose our confidential or propriety information in addition third party that we may rely on to store and or process our confidential information may also be subject to similar threat such threat could result in the misappropriation theft misuse disclosure loss or destruction of the technology intellectual property or the proprietary confidential or personal information of or our employee customer licensee supplier or other third party well damage to or disruption in our information technology system these threat are constantly evolving increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measure we seek to detect and investigate all security and to prevent their recurrence but attempt to gain unauthorized access to our information technology system or other attack may be successful and in some case we might be unaware of an incident or it magnitude and effect in addition employee and former employee in particular former employee who become employee of our competitor customer licensee or other third party including state actor have in the past and may in the future misappropriate use publish or provide to our competitor customer licensee or other third party including state actor our technology intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information this risk is exacerbated competitor for talent particularly engineering talent increasingly attempt to hire our employee see also the risk factor entitled we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employee similarly we provide access to certain of our technology intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information to our direct and indirect customer and licensee and certain of our consultant who have in the past and may in the future wrongfully use such technology intellectual property or information or wrongfully disclose such technology intellectual property or information to third party including our competitor or state actor we also provide access to certain of our technology intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information to certain of our joint venture partner including those affiliated with state actor and including in foreign jurisdiction where ownership restriction may require to take minority ownership interest in the joint venture such joint venture partner may wrongfully use such technology intellectual property or information or wrongfully disclose such technology intellectual property or information to third party including our competitor or state actor the misappropriation theft misuse disclosure loss or destruction of the technology intellectual property or the proprietary confidential or personal information of or our employee customer licensee supplier or other third party could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiative cause to lose business damage our reputation subject to legal or regulatory proceeding cause to incur other loss or liability and otherwise adversely affect our business we expect to continue to devote significant resource to the security of our information technology system and our technology intellectual property and proprietary and confidential information further china ha implemented and other country or region may implement cybersecurity law that require our overall information technology security environment to meet certain standard and or be certified such law may be complex ambiguous and subject to interpretation which may create uncertainty regarding compliance result our effort to comply with such law may be expensive and may fail which could adversely affect our business result of operation and cash flow risk related to intellectual property the enforcement and protection of our intellectual property may be expensive could fail to prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property could result in the loss of our ability to enforce one or more patent and could be adversely affected by change in patent law by law in certain foreign jurisdiction that may not effectively protect our intellectual property and by ineffective enforcement of law in such jurisdiction we rely primarily on patent copyright trademark and trade secret law well nondisclosure and confidentiality agreement international treaty and other method to protect our intellectual property including our patent portfolio policing unauthorized use of our product technology and intellectual property is difficult and time consuming the step we have taken have not always prevented and we can not be certain the step we will take in the future will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our product technology or intellectual property particularly in foreign country where the law may not protect our right fully or readily law or where the enforcement of such law may be lacking or ineffective see also the risk factor entitled our business and operation could suffer in the event of security breach of our information technology system or other misappropriation of our technology intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information some industry participant who have vested interest in devaluing patent in general or standard essential patent in particular have mounted attack on certain patent system increasing the likelihood of change to established patent law in the united state there is continued discussion regarding potential patent law change and current and potential future litigation regarding patent the outcome of which could be detrimental to our licensing business the law in certain foreign country in which our product are or may be manufactured or sold including certain country in asia may not protect our intellectual property right to the same extent the law in the united state we can not predict with certainty the long term effect of any potential change in addition we can not be certain that the law and policy of any country or the practice of any standard body foreign or domestic with respect to intellectual property enforcement or licensing or the adoption of standard will not be changed in the future in way detrimental to our licensing program or to the sale or use of our product or technology we have had and may in the future have difficulty in certain circumstance in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property and contract including collecting royalty for use of our patent portfolio due to among others refusal by certain licensee to report and pay all or portion of the royalty they owe to policy or political action of government including trade protection and national security policy challenge to our licensing practice under competition law adoption of mandatory licensing provision by foreign jurisdiction failure of foreign court to recognize and enforce judgment of contract breach and damage issued by court in the united state and challenge before competition agency to our licensing business and the pricing and integration of additional feature and functionality into our chipset product see also the risk factor entitled effort by some oems to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalty for the use of our property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resource and may result in legal decision or action by government court regulator or agency standard development organization sdos or other industry organization that harm our business and our business may suffer result of adverse ruling in government investigation or proceeding we have engaged in litigation and arbitration in the past and may need to further litigate or arbitrate in the future to enforce our contract and intellectual property right protect our trade secret or determine the validity and scope of proprietary right of others result of any such litigation or arbitration we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patent portion of our license agreement could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable which may in turn result in other licensee either not complying with their existing license agreement or initiating litigation or arbitration license term including but not limited to royalty rate for the use of our intellectual property could be imposed that are le favorable to than existing term and we could incur substantial cost any action we take to enforce our contract or intellectual property right could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention which in turn could negatively impact our result of operation and cash flow further even positive resolution to our enforcement effort may take time to conclude which may reduce our revenue and cash resource available for other purpose such research and development in the period prior to conclusion additionally although our license agreement provide with the right to audit the book and record of licensee audit can be expensive time consuming incomplete and subject to dispute further certain licensee may not comply with the obligation to provide full access to their book and record to the extent we do not aggressively enforce our right under our license agreement licensee may not comply with their existing license agreement and to the extent we do not aggressively pursue unlicensed company to enter into license agreement with for their use of our intellectual property other unlicensed company may not enter into license agreement similarly we provide access to certain of our intellectual property and proprietary and confidential business information to our direct and indirect customer and licensee who have in the past and may in the future wrongfully use such intellectual property and information or wrongfully disclose such intellectual property and information to third party including our competitor see also the risk factor entitled effort by some oems to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalty for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resource and may result in legal decision or action by government court regulator or agency standard development organization sdos or other industry organization that harm our business claim by other company that we infringe their intellectual property could adversely affect our business from time to time company have asserted and may again assert patent copyright and other intellectual property claim against our product or product using our technology or other technology used in our industry these claim have resulted and may again result in our involvement in litigation we may not prevail in such litigation given among other factor the complex technical issue and inherent uncertainty in intellectual property litigation if any of our product were found to infringe another company intellectual property we could be subject to an injunction or be required to redesign our product or to license such intellectual property or pay damage or other compensation to such other company any of which could be costly if we are unable to redesign our product license such intellectual property used in our product or otherwise distribute our product through licensed supplier we could be prohibited from making and selling our product similarly our supplier could be found to infringe another company intellectual property and such supplier could then be enjoined from providing product or service to in any potential dispute involving and another company patent or other intellectual property our chipset foundry semiconductor assembly and test provider and customer could also become the target of litigation we are contingently liable under certain product sale service license and other agreement to indemnify certain customer chipset foundry and semiconductor assembly and test service provider against certain type of liability and damage arising from qualifying claim of patent infringement by product sold by or by intellectual property provided by to our chipset foundry and semiconductor assembly and test service provider reimbursement under indemnification arrangement could have an adverse effect on our result of operation and cash flow furthermore any such litigation could severely disrupt the supply of our product and the business of our chipset customer and their customer which in turn could harm our relationship with them and could result in decline in our chipset sale or reduction in our licensee sale causing corresponding decline in our chipset or licensing revenue any claim regardless of their merit could be time consuming to address result in costly litigation divert the effort of our technical and management personnel or cause product release or shipment delay any of which could have an adverse effect on our result of operation and cash flow we may continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front of administrative body such the united state international trade commission to defend against patent assertion against our product by company some of whom are attempting to gain competitive advantage or leverage in licensing negotiation we may not be successful in such proceeding and if we are not the range of possible outcome is very broad and may include for example monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money royalty payment injunction on the sale of certain of our integrated circuit product or on the sale of our customer device using such product or the issuance of order to cease certain conduct or modify our business practice further governmental body in particular country or region may assert and may be successful in imposing remedy with effect that extend beyond the border of that country or region in addition negative outcome in any such proceeding could severely disrupt the business of our chipset customer and their wireless operator which in turn could harm our relationship with them and could result in decline in our chipset sale or reduction in our licensee sale to wireless operator causing corresponding decline in our chipset or licensing revenue certain legal matter which may include certain claim by other company that we infringe their intellectual property are described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency our use of open source software may harm our business certain of our software and our supplier software may contain or may be derived from open source software and we have seen and believe that we will continue to see an increase in customer requesting that we develop product including software associated with our integrated circuit product that incorporate open source software element and operate in an open source environment which under certain open source license may offer accessibility to portion of our product source code and may expose our related intellectual property to adverse licensing condition licensing of such software may impose certain obligation on if we were to distribute derivative work of that software for example these obligation may require to make source code for the derivative work available to our customer in manner that allows them to make such source code available to their customer or license such derivative work under particular type of license that is different than what we customarily use to license our software furthermore in the course of product development we may make contribution to third party open source project that could obligate our intellectual property to adverse licensing condition for example to encourage the growth of software ecosystem that is interoperable with our product we may need to contribute certain implementation under the open source licensing term that govern such project which may adversely impact our associated intellectual property developing open source product while adequately protecting the intellectual property upon which our licensing program depends may prove burdensome and time consuming under certain circumstance thereby placing at competitive disadvantage and we may not adequately protect our intellectual property also our use and our customer use of open source software may subject our product and our customer product to governmental and third party scrutiny and delay in product certification which could cause customer to view our product le desirable than our competitor product while we believe we have taken appropriate step and employ adequate control to protect our intellectual property our contribution to and use of open source software present risk that could have an adverse effect on these and on our business risk related to human capital management we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employee our future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officer and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to identify attract retain and motivate them implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent our revenue are highly dependent on technological and product innovation the market for employee in our industry is extremely competitive and competitor for talent particularly engineering talent increasingly attempt to hire and to varying degree have been successful in hiring our employee including by establishing local office near our headquarters in san diego california number of such competitor for talent are significantly larger than and are able to offer compensation in excess of what we are able to offer further existing immigration law make it more difficult for to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduate of university in the united state making the pool of available talent even smaller if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employee our business may be harmed risk related to product defect or security vulnerability failure in our product or in the product of our customer or licensee including those resulting from security vulnerability defect or error could harm our business our product including related software are complex and may contain defect error or security vulnerability or experience failure or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issue including issue in material design fabrication packaging and or use within system further because of the complexity of our product defect or error might only be detected when the product are in use development of product in new domain of technology such the transition to and the migration to integrated circuit technology with smaller geometric feature size increase complexity and add risk to manufacturing yield and reliability and increase the likelihood of product defect or error risk associated with product defect error or security vulnerability are exacerbated by the fact that our customer typically integrate our product into consumer and other device the use of device containing our product to interact with untrusted system or otherwise access untrusted content creates risk of exposing the system hardware and software in those device to malicious attack security vulnerability in our product could expose our customer or end user to hacker or other unscrupulous third party who develop and deploy virus worm and other malicious software program that could attack our product or those of our customer while we continue to focus on this issue and take measure to safeguard our product from cybersecurity threat device capability continue to evolve enabling more elaborate functionality and application and increasing the risk of security failure our product may be responsible for critical function in our customer product and network failure of our product to perform to specification or other product defect error or security vulnerability could lead to substantial damage to the product we sell to our customer the device into which our product are integrated and to the end user of such device defect error or security vulnerability could give rise to significant cost including cost related to developing solution recalling product repairing or replacing defective product writing down defective inventory or the indemnification clause in our agreement and could result in the loss of sale and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development effort in addition defect error or security vulnerability in our product could result in failure to achieve market acceptance loss of design win shifting of business to our competitor and litigation or regulatory action against and could harm our reputation our relationship with customer and partner and our ability to attract new customer well the perception of our brand other potential adverse impact of product defect error or security vulnerability include shipment delay write offs of property plant and equipment and intangible asset and loss on unfavorable purchase commitment in addition defect error or security vulnerability in the product of our customer or licensee could cause delay or decrease in demand for the product into which our product are integrated and thus for our product in addition the occurrence of defect may give rise to product liability claim particularly if defect in our product or the product into which they are integrated result in personal injury or death and could result in significant cost expense and loss if product liability claim is brought against the cost of defending the claim could be significant and could divert the effort of our technical and management personnel and harm our business even if we are successful we may be named in product liability claim even if there is no evidence that our product caused the damage in question and even though we may have indemnity from our customer and such claim could result in significant cost and expense further our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable term which could adversely impact our financial result the above is exacerbated by the fact that our product may be used and perform critical function in various high risk application such automobile including autonomous driver assistance program camera and artificial intelligence including home and enterprise security home automation including smoke and noxious gas detector medical condition monitoring location and asset tracking and management including wearable for child safety and elderly health robotics including public safety drone and autonomous municipality vehicle and extended reality xr for treatment of phobia or ptsd early detection of disorder or special need among others accordingly defect error or security vulnerability in our product could have an adverse impact on on our customer and the end user of our customer product if any of these risk materialize there could be material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition general risk factor we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturn we are also susceptible to decline in global regional and local economic condition generally our stock price and financial result are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuation due to these dynamic among others the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical volatile subject to downturn and characterized by constant and rapid technological change price erosion evolving technical standard frequent new product introduction short product life cycle and fluctuation in product supply and demand period of downturn have been characterized by diminished demand for end user product high inventory level excess or obsolete inventory adjustment underutilization of manufacturing capacity change in revenue mix and erosion of average selling price we expect our business to continue to be subject to such cyclical downturn consequently our revenue may decline and our result of operation and financial condition may be adversely impacted decline in global regional or local economic condition or slow down in economic growth particularly in geographic region with high concentration of wireless voice and data user or high concentration of our customer or licensee could have adverse wide ranging effect on our business and financial result including decrease in demand for our product and technology decrease in demand for the product and service of our customer or licensee the inability of our supplier to deliver on their supply commitment to our inability to supply our product to our customer and or the inability of our customer or licensee to supply their product to end user the insolvency of key supplier customer or licensee delay in reporting or payment from our customer or licensee failure by counterparties and or negative effect on wireless device inventory in addition our customer and licensee ability to purchase or pay for our product and intellectual property and network operator ability to upgrade their wireless network could be adversely affected potentially leading to reduction cancellation or delay of order for our product our stock price and financial result have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future factor that may have significant impact on the market price of our stock and our financial result include those identified above and throughout this risk factor section volatility of the stock market in general and technology and semiconductor company in particular announcement concerning our supplier our competitor or our customer or licensee and variation between our actual financial result or guidance and expectation of security analyst or investor among others in the past security class action litigation ha been brought against company following period of volatility in the market price of their security among other reason we are and may in the future be the target of security litigation security litigation could result in substantial uninsured cost and divert management attention and our resource certain legal matter including certain security litigation brought against are described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency business may suffer due to the impact of or our failure to comply with the various existing new or amended law regulation policy or standard to which we are subject our business and product and those of our customer and licensee are subject to various law rule and regulation globally well government policy and the specification of international national and regional communication standard body collectively regulation compliance with or change in the interpretation of existing regulation change in the oversight of our activity by government or standard body or ruling in court regulatory administrative or other proceeding relating to such regulation including among others regulation affecting patent licensing practice antitrust competition and competitive business practice the flow of fund out of certain country china cybersecurity import and export regulation such the export administration regulation administered by the department of commerce protection of intellectual property trade and trade protection including tariff foreign policy and national security environmental protection health and safety supply chain responsible sourcing including the use of conflict mineral and human right spectrum availability and license issuance adoption of standard taxation privacy and data protection labor employment and human capital corporate governance public disclosure or business conduct could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation see also the risk factor entitled our business may suffer result of adverse ruling in government investigation or proceeding change in our patent licensing practice whether due to governmental investigation or private legal proceeding challenging those practice or otherwise could adversely impact our business and result of operation significant portion of our business is concentrated in china and the risk of such concentration are exacerbated by china trade and national security tension there are numerous risk associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facility including higher portion of fixed cost relative to fable model environmental compliance and liability issue related to climate change exposure to natural disaster timely supply of equipment and material and various manufacturing issue and tax liability could adversely affect our result of operation regulation are complex and changing which may create uncertainty regarding compliance are subject to varying interpretation and their application in practice may evolve over time result our effort to comply with regulation may fail particularly if there is ambiguity to how they should be applied in practice failure to comply with any regulation may adversely affect our business result of operation and cash flow new regulation or evolving interpretation thereof may cause to incur higher cost we revise current practice policy or procedure and may divert management time and attention to compliance activity there are risk associated with our debt our outstanding debt and any additional debt we incur may have negative consequence on our business including among others requiring to use cash to pay the principal of and interest on our debt thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purpose limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditure acquisition stock repurchase dividend general corporate or other purpose and limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to change in our business industry or the market our ability to make payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which is subject to economic and political condition industry cycle and financial business and other factor many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operation to service our debt we may be required to among other thing refinance or restructure all or portion of our debt reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditure reduce suspend or eliminate our dividend payment and or our stock repurchase program or sell selected asset such measure might not be sufficient to enable to service our debt in addition any such refinancing restructuring or sale of asset might not be available on economically favorable term or at all and if prevailing interest rate at the time of any such refinancing or restructuring are higher than our current rate interest expense related to such refinancing or restructuring would increase further if there are adverse change in the rating assigned to our debt security by credit rating agency our borrowing cost our ability to access debt in the future and the term of such debt could be adversely affected tax liability could adversely affect our result of operation we are subject to income tax in the united state and numerous foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income tax we regularly are subject to examination of our tax return and report by taxing authority in the united state federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdiction most notably in country where we earn routine return and the tax authority believe substantial value add activity are performed although we believe that our tax estimate are reasonable the final determination of tax audit and any related legal proceeding could materially differ from amount reflected in our income tax provision and accrual in such case our income tax provision result of operation and cash flow in the period or period in which that determination is made could be negatively affected tax rule may change in manner that adversely affect our future reported result of operation or the way we conduct our business in response to the tax cut and job act and to better align our profit with our activity we implemented certain restructuring in fiscal and after our restructuring most of our income is taxable in the united state with significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment fdii foreign derived intangible income beginning in fiscal the effective tax rate for fdii increase from to further if tax rate increase or the fdii deduction is eliminated or reduced our provision for income tax result of operation and cash flow would be adversely affected also if our customer move manufacturing operation to the united state our fdii deduction will be reduced have tax incentive in singapore that require we meet specified employment and other criterion although our profit in singapore ha declined result of our restructuring failure to meet these incentive requirement through march could result in retroactive singapore tax increase for and further change in the tax law of foreign

legislation became effective for at the beginning of fiscal including fdii foreign derived intangible income in response to the tax legislation and to better align our profit with our activity we implemented certain tax restructuring in fiscal and result beginning in fiscal substantially all of our income is in the of which significant portion qualifies for preferential treatment fdii at effective tax rate our annual effective tax rate for fiscal reflected blended federal statutory rate of approximately in the fourth quarter of fiscal the united state treasury department issued final regulation on deduction for fdii which are retroactive to fiscal result of these regulation our fiscal annual effective tax rate increased by approximately in the first quarter of fiscal the united state treasury department issued final regulation on the foreign tax credit which we anticipate will adversely affect our effective tax rate the impact of these regulation which are retroactive to fiscal ha not been included in our fiscal effective tax rate while we continue to evaluate these new regulation we currently do not expect the adverse impact to fiscal and to be significant result of the tax legislation in fiscal several of our foreign subsidiary made tax election to be treated branch for federal income tax purpose commonly referred to check the box election effective beginning in fiscal and result of making these check the box election we recorded tax benefit of million in fiscal additionally in fiscal the united state treasury department issued new temporary regulation that resulted in change to the deductibility of dividend income received by stockholder from foreign corporation result of this change pursuant to an agreement with the internal revenue service we relinquished the federal tax basis step up of intellectual property that wa distributed in fiscal by one of our foreign subsidiary to subsidiary therefore the related deferred tax asset wa derecognized resulting in billion charge to income tax expense in fiscal in fiscal result of the tax legislation we recorded charge of billion to income tax expense comprised of billion related to the

established result of change in one of our position due to the tax legislation unrecognized tax benefit were billion and billion at september and september respectively the increase in unrecognized tax benefit in fiscal wa primarily due to our decision in fiscal to request refund of korean withholding tax licensee in korea continue to withhold tax on payment due under their licensing agreement at rate higher than we believe is owed which had an insignificant impact to our income tax provision if successful the refund will result in corresponding reduction in foreign tax credit we are subject to tax in the united state and numerous foreign jurisdiction and are currently under examination by various tax authority worldwide primarily related to transfer pricing these examination are at various stage with respect to assessment claim deficiency and refund we continually ass the likelihood and amount of potential adjustment and adjust the income tax provision income tax payable and deferred tax in the period in which the fact give rise to revision become known of september we believe that adequate amount have been reserved for based on fact known however the final determination of tax audit and any related legal proceeding could materially differ from amount reflected in our income tax provision and the related accrual segment resultsthe following should be read in

value is defined the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participant of the measurement date applicable accounting guidance provides an established hierarchy for input used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable input and minimizes the use of unobservable input by requiring that the most observable input be used when available observable input are input that market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from source independent of unobservable input are input that reflect our assumption about the factor that market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability there are three level of input that may be used to measure fair value level includes financial instrument for which quoted market price for identical instrument are available in active market level includes financial instrument for which there are input other than quoted price included within level that are observable for the instrument level includes financial instrument for which fair value is derived from valuation technique in which one or more significant input are unobservable including our own assumption asset and liability measured at fair value are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement we review the fair value hierarchy classification on quarterly basis change in the observability of valuation input may result in reclassification of level for certain security within the fair value hierarchy we recognize transfer into and out of level within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the fiscal month in which the actual event or change in circumstance that caused the transfer to occur cash equivalent and marketable security with the exception of auction rate security we obtain pricing information from quoted market price pricing vendor or quote from broker dealer we conduct review of our primary pricing incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementsvendors to determine whether the input used in the vendor pricing process are deemed to be observable the fair value for interest bearing security includes accrued interest the fair value of treasury security and government related security corporate bond and note and common stock is generally determined using standard observable input including reported trade quoted market price matrix pricing benchmark yield broker dealer quote issuer spread two sided market and or benchmark security the fair value of mortgage and asset backed security is derived from the use of matrix pricing price for similar security or in some case cash flow pricing model with observable input such contractual term maturity credit rating and or securitization structure to determine the timing and amount of future cash flow the fair value of auction rate security is estimated using discounted cash flow model that incorporates transaction detail such contractual term maturity and timing and amount of future cash flow well assumption related to liquidity default likelihood and recovery the future state of the auction rate market and credit valuation adjustment of market participant though most of the security we hold are pool of student loan guaranteed by the united state government prepayment speed and illiquidity discount are considered significant unobservable input and therefore auction rate security are included in level derivative instrument derivative instrument that are traded on an exchange are valued using quoted market price and are included in level derivative instrument that are not traded on an exchange are valued using conventional calculation model that are primarily based on observable input such foreign currency exchange rate volatility and interest rate and therefore such derivative instrument are included in level other investment and other liability other investment and other liability included in level are comprised of our deferred compensation plan liability and related asset which consist of mutual fund and are included in other asset gain and loss on the revaluation of our deferred compensation plan asset are recorded in investment and other income net note and are not allocated to our segment corresponding offsetting amount related to the revaluation of our deferred compensation plan liability are included in unallocated operating expense note other investment and other liability included in level are primarily comprised of convertible debt instrument issued by private company the fair value of convertible debt instrument is estimated based on the estimated timing and amount of future cash flow well assumption related to liquidity default likelihood and recovery the input we use to estimate the fair value of the convertible debt instrument are generally unobservable and therefore they are included in level inventory inventory are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value using the first in first out method recoverability of inventory is assessed based on review of future customer demand that considers multiple factor including committed purchase order from customer well purchase commitment projection provided by customer and our own forecast of customer demand among other factor this valuation also requires to make judgment and assumption based on information currently available about market condition including competition product pricing product life cycle development plan and other broader market condition that may impact customer demand such the coronavirus covid pandemic in fiscal that negatively impacted consumer demand for certain device that incorporate our product we move to smaller geometry process technology the manufacturing lead time increase resulting in an increased reliance on our own forecast of customer demand rather than our customer forecast if we overestimate demand for our product the amount of our loss will be impacted by our contractual ability to reduce inventory purchase from our supplier our assumption of future product demand are inherently uncertain and change in our estimate and assumption may cause to record additional write down in the future if demand forecasted for specific product is greater than actual demand property plant and equipment property plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful life upon the retirement or disposition of property plant and equipment the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed and gain or loss is recorded when appropriate building on owned land are depreciated over year and building improvement are depreciated over year leasehold improvement and building on leased land are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful life not to exceed year and year respectively or the remaining term of the related lease other property plant and equipment have useful life ranging from to year maintenance repair and minor renewal or betterment are charged to expense incurred operating lease result of the adoption of asc we revised our operating lease accounting policy beginning in fiscal follows operating lease asset and liability are recognized for lease with lease term greater than month based on the present value of the future lease payment over the lease term at the commencement date operating lease are included in other asset other current liability and other liability on our consolidated balance sheet our lease term may include option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such option we account for substantially all lease and related non lease component together single lease component operating lease expense is recognized on straight line basis over the lease term goodwill and other intangible asset goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible asset of business acquired acquired intangible asset other than goodwill are amortized over their useful life unless the life are determined to be indefinite for intangible asset purchased in business incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementscombination the estimated fair value of the asset received are used to establish their recorded value for intangible asset acquired in nonmonetary exchange the estimated fair value of the asset transferred or the estimated fair value of the asset received if more clearly evident are used to establish their recorded value unless the value of neither the asset received nor the asset transferred are determinable within reasonable limit in which case the asset received are measured based on the carrying value of the asset transferred valuation technique consistent with the market approach income approach and or cost approach are used to measure fair value an estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumption that require significant judgment for example the income approach generally requires to use assumption to estimate future cash flow including those related to total addressable market pricing and share forecast competition technology obsolescence future tax rate and discount rate our estimate of the fair value of certain asset may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumption or utilize different business model and from the future cash flow actually realized impairment of goodwill other indefinite lived asset and long lived asset goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset are tested annually for impairment in the fourth fiscal quarter and in interim period if event or change in circumstance indicate that the asset may be impaired if qualitative assessment is used and we determine that the fair value of reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset is more likely than not likelihood of more than le than it carrying amount quantitative impairment test will be performed if goodwill is quantitatively assessed for impairment and reporting unit carrying value exceeds it fair value the difference is recorded an impairment other indefinite lived intangible asset are quantitatively assessed for impairment if necessary by comparing their estimated fair value to their carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the difference is recorded an impairment our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicator and future cash flow related to goodwill and long lived asset may be based on operational performance of our business market condition expected selling price and or other factor although there are inherent uncertainty in this assessment process the estimate and assumption we use including estimate of future cash flow and discount rate are consistent with our internal planning when appropriate if these estimate or their related assumption change in the future we may be required to record an impairment charge on portion or all of our goodwill and or long lived asset furthermore we can not predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering event nor the impact such event might have on our reported asset value future event could cause to conclude that impairment indicator exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired business are impaired long lived asset such property plant and equipment and intangible asset subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of asset to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds it estimated future cash flow an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group long lived asset to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or their estimated fair value le cost to sell and are not depreciated revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from sale of integrated circuit product and licensing of our intellectual property we also generate revenue from licensing system software and by performing development and other service and from other product sale the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon variety of factor including the specific term of each arrangement and the nature of our performance obligation revenue from sale of our product are recognized upon transfer of control to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment revenue from providing service are typically recognized over time our performance obligation is satisfied revenue from providing service and licensing system software were each le than of total revenue for all period presented we grant license or otherwise provide right to use portion of our intellectual property portfolio which among other right includes certain patent right essential to and or useful in the manufacture sale or use of certain wireless product licensee pay royalty based on their sale of product incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property and may also pay fixed license fee in one or more installment sale based royalty are generally based upon percentage of the wholesale licensee selling price of complete licensed product net of certain permissible deduction including transportation insurance packing cost and other item we broadly provide per unit royalty cap that apply to certain category of complete wireless device namely smartphones tablet laptop and smartwatches and provide for maximum royalty amount payable per device we estimate and recognize sale based royalty on such licensed product in the period in which the associated sale occur considering all relevant information historical current and forecasted that is reasonably available to our estimate of sale based royalty are based largely on preliminary royalty estimate provided by our licensee and to lesser extent an assessment of the volume of device supplied into the market that incorporate or use our licensed intellectual property combined with an estimate of the mix of such sale on licensee by licensee basis well the licensee average wholesale price of such product we have recognized immaterial difference between preliminary royalty estimate provided to by licensee and actual amount reported and paid by licensee which are generally received the following quarter licensee have not completed their royalty reporting process at the time estimate are provided to and in certain case they do not provide all necessary information in order for to calculate an estimate of royalty due which requires to independently estimate certain information we also consider in our estimate of sale based royalty any change in pricing we plan or expect to make and certain constraint on our ability to estimate such royalty result incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementsof recognizing revenue in the period in which the licensee sale occur using estimate adjustment to revenue are required in subsequent period to reflect change in estimate new information becomes available primarily resulting from actual amount reported by our licensee license agreement that require payment of license fee contain single performance obligation that represents ongoing access to portfolio of intellectual property over the license term since such agreement provide the licensee the right to access portfolio of intellectual property that exists at inception of the license agreement and to update and new intellectual property that is added to the licensed portfolio during the term of the agreement that are highly interdependent or interrelated since we expect to expend effort to develop and transfer update to our licensed portfolio on an even basis license fee are recognized revenue on straight line basis over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee we account for contract with customer licensee when it is legally enforceable the party are committed to perform their respective obligation the right of the party regarding the good and or service to be transferred are identified payment term are identified the contract ha commercial substance and collectability of substantially all of the consideration is probable if all such condition are not met revenue and any associated receivables are generally not recognized until such time that the required condition are met cash collected from customer prior to contract existing is recorded to other customer related liability in other current liability from time to time regulatory authority investigate our business practice particularly with respect to our licensing business and institute proceeding against depending on the matter various remedy that could result from an unfavorable resolution include among others the loss of our ability to enforce one or more of our patent injunction monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money the issuance of order to cease certain conduct or modify our business practice such requiring to reduce our royalty rate reduce the base on which our royalty are calculated grant patent license to chipset manufacturer sell chipsets to unlicensed original equipment manufacturer oems or modify or renegotiate some or all of our existing license agreement and determination that some or all of our license agreement are invalid or unenforceable additionally from time to time company initiate various strategy in an attempt to negotiate renegotiate reduce and or eliminate their need to pay royalty to for the use of our intellectual property which may include disputing underreporting underpaying not reporting and or not paying royalty owed to under their license agreement with or reporting to in manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligation in such case we estimate and recognize licensing revenue only when we have contract defined in the revenue recognition guidance which includes among other item evaluating whether our license agreement remain valid and enforceable and evaluating licensee conduct and whether they remain committed to perform their respective obligation we also estimate and recognize licensing revenue only to the extent it is probable that significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur which includes among other item determining the expected impact if any to revenue of any license agreement that may be renegotiated and or are newly entered into we analyze the risk of significant revenue reversal considering both the likelihood and magnitude of the reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of estimated revenue recognized in order to mitigate this risk which may result in recognizing revenue le than amount contractually owed to these aforementioned estimate may require significant judgment we measure revenue including our estimate of sale based royalty based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for product or service we record reduction to revenue for customer incentive arrangement including volume related and other pricing rebate and cost reimbursement for marketing and other activity involving certain of our product and technology in the period that the related revenue are earned the charge for such arrangement are recorded reduction to account receivable net or other current liability based on whether we have the intent and contractual right of offset certain of these charge are considered variable consideration and are included in the transaction price primarily based on estimating the most likely amount expected to be provided to the customer licensee revenue recognized from sale of our product and sale based royalty are generally included in account receivable net including unbilled receivables based on our unconditional right to payment for satisfied or partially satisfied performance obligation concentration significant portion of our revenue are concentrated with small number of customer licensee of our qct and qtl segment revenue from four customer licensee comprised and of total consolidated revenue in fiscal revenue from three customer licensee comprised and of total consolidated revenue in fiscal and and in fiscal revenue in fiscal were positively impacted by the settlement of our prior dispute with huawei note revenue in fiscal were negatively impacted by our prior dispute with apple and it contract manufacturer we rely on sole or limited source supplier for some product particularly product in the qct segment subjecting to possible shortage of raw material or manufacturing capacity the loss of supplier or the inability of supplier to meet performance or quality specification or delivery schedule could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligation and or negatively impact our revenue business operation and ability to compete for future business shipping and handling cost cost incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of revenue amount billed to customer for shipping and handling are reported revenue share based compensation share based compensation expense for equity classified award

stock on the date of grant or date the rsus are assumed share based compensation expense is adjusted to exclude amount related to share based award that are expected to be forfeited legal and regulatory proceeding we are currently involved in certain legal and regulatory proceeding litigation and investigation are inherently uncertain and we face difficulty in evaluating or estimating likely outcome or range of possible loss in antitrust and trade regulation investigation in particular investigation by antitrust and trade regulation agency are not conducted in consistent manner across jurisdiction further each country and agency ha different set of law rule and regulation both substantive and procedural well different legal principle theory and potential remedy and some agency may seek to use the investigation to advance domestic policy goal depending on the jurisdiction these investigation can involve non transparent procedure under which we may not receive access to evidence relied upon by the enforcement agency or that may be exculpatory and may not be informed of the specific legal theory or evidence considered or relied upon by the agency unlike in civil litigation in the united state in foreign proceeding we may not be entitled to discovery or deposition allowed to cross examine witness or confront our accuser result we may not be aware of and may not be entitled to know all allegation against or the information or document provided to or discovered or prepared by the agency accordingly we may have little or no idea what an agency intent is with respect to liability penalty or the timing of decision in many case the agency are given significant discretion and any available precedent may have limited if any predictive value in their jurisdiction much le in other jurisdiction accordingly we can not predict the outcome of these matter broad range of remedy with respect to our business practice that are deemed to violate applicable law are potentially available these remedy may include among others injunction monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money and the issuance of order to cease certain conduct and or to modify our business practice if there is at least reasonable possibility that material loss may have been incurred associated with pending legal and regulatory proceeding we disclose such fact and if reasonably estimable we provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of possible loss we record our best estimate of loss related to pending legal and regulatory proceeding when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated where range of loss can be reasonably estimated with no best estimate in the range we record the minimum estimated liability additional information becomes available we ass the potential liability related to pending legal and regulatory proceeding and revise our estimate and update our disclosure accordingly significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination to whether loss is reasonably estimable our legal cost associated with defending ourself are recorded to expense incurred foreign currency certain foreign subsidiary use local currency the functional currency resulting translation gain or loss are recorded component of accumulated other comprehensive income transaction gain or loss related to balance denominated in currency other than the functional currency are recognized in the consolidated statement of operation income tax the asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax asset and liability for the expected future tax consequence of temporary difference between the carrying amount and the tax base of asset and liability tax law and rate change are reflected in income in the period such change are enacted we record valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized we include interest and penalty related to income tax including unrecognized tax benefit within income tax expense we classify all deferred tax asset and liability noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet our income tax return are based on calculation and assumption that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authority in addition the calculation of our tax liability involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulation we recognize liability for uncertain tax position based on two step process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement while we believe we have appropriate support for the position taken on our tax return we regularly ass the potential outcome of examination by tax authority in determining the adequacy of our provision for income tax we continually ass the likelihood and amount of potential adjustment and adjust the income tax provision income tax payable and deferred tax in the period in which the fact that give rise to revision become known we recognize excess tax benefit and shortfall tax detriment associated with share based award in the consolidated statement of operation component of income tax expense when realized we are subject to income tax in the united state and numerous foreign jurisdiction and the assessment of our income tax position involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax law and regulation in various taxing jurisdiction in addition the application of tax law and regulation is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax law and regulation themselves are subject to change result of change in fiscal policy change in legislation the evolution of regulation and court ruling significant judgment and estimate are required in determining our provision for income tax including those related to special deduction such fdii foreign derived intangible income tax incentive intercompany research and development cost sharing arrangement transfer pricing tax credit and the realizability of deferred tax asset while we believe we have appropriate support for the position we have taken or that we plan to take on our tax return we regularly ass the potential outcome of examination by taxing incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementsauthorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income tax therefore the actual liability for or foreign tax may be materially different from our estimate which could result in the need to record additional tax liability or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liability we are participating in the internal revenue service irs compliance assurance process program whereby we endeavor to agree with the irs on the treatment of all issue prior to filing our federal return benefit of participation in this program is that post filing adjustment by the irs are le likely to occur earnings loss per common share basic earnings loss per common share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common share outstanding during the reporting period diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the combination of the weighted average number of dilutive common share equivalent comprised of share issuable under our share based compensation plan and share subject to accelerated share repurchase agreement if any and the weighted average number of common share outstanding during the reporting period due to the net loss in fiscal all of the common share equivalent issuable under share based compensation plan and the accelerated share repurchase agreement we entered into in fiscal had an anti dilutive effect and were therefore excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share the following table provides information about the diluted earnings per share calculation in million common share equivalent included in diluted share of common stock equivalent not included because the effect would be anti dilutive or certain performance condition were not satisfied at the end of the recent accounting pronouncement not yet adopted financial asset in june the fasb issued new accounting guidance that change the accounting for recognizing impairment of financial asset under the new accounting guidance credit loss for financial asset held at amortized cost such account receivable will be estimated based on expected loss rather than the current incurred loss impairment model our historical credit loss for account receivable have been immaterial the new accounting guidance also eliminates the concept of other than temporary impairment and requires credit loss related to available for sale debt security to be recorded through an allowance for credit loss rather than reduction in the amortized cost basis of the security these change will result in earlier recognition of credit loss if any the new accounting guidance generally requires the modified retrospective transition method with the cumulative effect of applying the new accounting guidance recognized an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption except for certain financial asset where the prospective transition method is required such available for sale debt security for which an other than temporary impairment ha been recorded we will adopt the new accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal we do not expect this new accounting guidance will have material impact to our consolidated financial statement at adoption the future impact of such accounting guidance will largely depend on the future composition and credit quality of our investment portfolio and account receivable well future economic condition note composition of certain financial statement itemsaccounts receivable in million september net of allowance for doubtful account account receivable at september included billion excluding the impact of foreign withholding tax from huawei related to the remaining amount due under the settlement agreement and estimated royalty for sale made in the september quarter in july we entered into settlement agreement with huawei to resolve our prior dispute related to the license agreement that expired on december we also entered into new long term global patent license agreement that applies to sale of certain wireless product by huawei beginning on january amount due under the settlement agreement are to be paid in installment by the end of june in accordance with an agreed upon payment schedule in the fourth quarter of fiscal huawei paid the first installment under the settlement agreement and the royalty due for the march and june quarter under the new global patent license agreement significant evaluation and judgment were required in determining the appropriate accounting for the settlement agreement and new global patent license agreement with huawei we considered among other item huawei commitment to perform under such agreement including huawei intent and ability to pay amount due huawei performance to date under the agreement including timely payment made huawei current and projected financial condition including the incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementsimpact of enacted national security protection policy by the government on huawei business and certain contractual protection that we obtained under these agreement based on this evaluation we concluded that the revenue recognition criterion were met and we recorded revenue of billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the full amount due from huawei under the settlement agreement and amount paid for the march and june quarter under the new global patent license agreement in addition qtl result for the fourth quarter of fiscal included estimated royalty due from huawei for sale made in the september quarter under the new global patent license agreement although we believe that the judgment supporting our assessment are reasonable based on fact and factor

measure have negatively impacted the condition of economy and financial market globally which ha negatively impacted certain company in which we hold non marketable equity investment including those accounted for under the equity method and to lesser extent non marketable debt security since the second quarter of fiscal significant evaluation and judgment were required in determining if the negative effect of covid indicated that such investment were impaired and if so the extent of such impairment this included among other item assessing the business impact that covid had and we currently expect to have in the future on our investees including taking into consideration the investee industry and geographic location and the impact to it customer supplier and employee applicable

the beginning of fiscal including fdii foreign derived intangible income in response to the tax legislation and to better align our profit with our activity we implemented certain tax restructuring in fiscal and result beginning in fiscal substantially all of our income is in the of which significant portion qualifies for preferential treatment fdii at effective tax rate our annual effective tax rate for fiscal reflected blended federal statutory rate of approximately in the fourth quarter of fiscal the united state treasury department issued final regulation on deduction for fdii which are retroactive to fiscal result of these regulation our fiscal annual effective tax rate increased by approximately in the first quarter of fiscal the united state treasury department issued final regulation on the foreign tax credit which we anticipate will adversely affect our effective tax rate the impact of these regulation which are retroactive to fiscal ha not been included in our fiscal effective tax rate while we continue to evaluate these new regulation we currently do not expect the adverse impact to fiscal and to be significant result of the tax legislation in fiscal several of our foreign subsidiary made election to be treated branch for federal income tax purpose commonly referred to check the box election effective beginning in fiscal and although beginning in fiscal the income of these entity is included in our consolidated tax return we believe that by treating these foreign subsidiary branch for federal income tax rather than controlled foreign corporation we will significantly reduce the risk of being subject to gilti global intangible low taxed income and beat base erosion and anti abuse tax tax result of making these check the box election we recorded tax benefit of million in the first quarter of fiscal due to establishing new net deferred tax asset resulting from the difference between the gaap basis and the federal tax carryover basis of the existing asset and liability of those foreign subsidiary primarily related to customer incentive liability that have not been deducted for tax purpose additionally during fiscal one of our foreign subsidiary distributed certain intellectual property to subsidiary resulting in difference between the gaap basis and the federal tax basis of the distributed intellectual property upon adoption of new accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal which changed the accounting for the income tax effect of intra entity transfer of asset other than inventory we recorded deferred tax asset of approximately billion primarily related to the distributed intellectual property with an adjustment to opening retained earnings during the third quarter of fiscal the united state treasury department issued new temporary regulation that resulted in change to the deductibility of dividend income received by stockholder from foreign corporation result of this change pursuant to an agreement with the internal revenue service we relinquished the federal tax basis step up of intellectual property that wa distributed in fiscal by one of our foreign subsidiary to subsidiary therefore the related deferred tax asset wa derecognized resulting in billion charge to income tax expense in fiscal in fiscal result of recent court ruling in korea among other factor we decided to apply for partial refund claim for tax previously withheld from licensee in korea on payment due under their license agreement to which we incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementshave claimed foreign tax credit in the united state result billion and billion wa recorded noncurrent income tax receivable recorded in other asset at september and september respectively and billion and billion wa recorded noncurrent liability for uncertain tax benefit of recorded in other liability at september and september respectively in fiscal result of the tax legislation we recorded charge of billion to income tax expense comprised of billion related to the estimated one time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profit of owned foreign subsidiary the toll charge and million resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax asset and liability that existed at the end of fiscal at lower enacted corporate income tax rate which included million tax benefit recorded in fiscal related to the remeasurement of deferred tax liability that wa established result of change in one of our tax position due to tax legislation after application of certain tax credit the total cash payment is billion at september we estimated remaining future payment of billion for the toll charge after application of certain tax credit including excess tax credit generated in fiscal which is payable in installment over the next six year at september million wa recorded in other current liability reflecting the next installment due in january income tax expense for fiscal wa also impacted by the charge recorded in fiscal related to the termination fee paid to nxp which did not result in tax benefit after the consideration of realizability of such loss fiscal income tax expense wa impacted by the ec fine and settlement with the tftc which were not deductible for tax purpose or taxable in the case of the settlement and which were attributable to foreign jurisdiction and to the united state certain of our tax incentive in singapore expired in march in fiscal we entered into new tax incentive agreement in singapore that result in reduced tax rate from march through march provided that we meet specified employment and investment criterion in singapore our singapore tax rate will increase in march result of expiration of these incentive and again in march upon the expiration of tax incentive under prior agreement during fiscal one of our singapore subsidiary distributed certain intellectual property to subsidiary reducing the benefit of these tax incentive almost entirely going forward without these tax incentive our income tax expense would have been higher in fiscal by million and impacted earnings per share by per share the impact in fiscal and wa not significant we continue to assert that certain of our foreign earnings are not indefinitely reinvested at september we had not recorded deferred tax liability of approximately million related to foreign withholding tax on approximately million of undistributed earnings of certain subsidiary that we continue to consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united state should we decide to no longer indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the united state we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we make such determination incorporatednotes to consolidated financial

through we do not expect our federal net operating loss carryforwards to expire unused at september we have provided valuation allowance on certain state tax credit foreign deferred tax asset federal capital loss federal foreign tax credit and state net operating loss of billion million million million and million respectively the valuation allowance reflects the uncertainty surrounding our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain foreign and state tax jurisdiction to utilize our net operating loss and our ability to generate sufficient capital gain to utilize all capital loss we believe more likely than not that we will have sufficient taxable income after deduction related to share based award to utilize our remaining deferred tax asset summary of the change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefit for fiscal and follows in million balance of unrecognized tax benefit addition based on prior year tax reduction for prior year tax position and lapse in statute of limitation addition for current year tax settlement with taxing authority ending balance of unrecognized tax benefit incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementsof the billion of unrecognized tax benefit billion ha been recorded to other noncurrent liability we believe that it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefit recorded at september may result in cash payment in fiscal unrecognized tax benefit at september included million for tax position that if recognized would impact the effective tax rate the unrecognized tax benefit differ from the amount that would affect our effective tax rate primarily because the unrecognized tax benefit were included on gross basis and did not reflect related receivables or secondary impact such the federal deduction for state tax adjustment to deferred tax asset and the valuation allowance that might be required if our tax position are sustained the increase in unrecognized tax benefit in fiscal and fiscal wa primarily due to our decision in fiscal to request for refund of korean withholding tax which had an insignificant impact to our income tax provision if successful the refund will result in corresponding reduction in foreign tax credit we believe that it is likely that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefit at september will increase in fiscal licensee in korea continue to withhold tax on future payment due under their licensing agreement at rate higher than we believe is owed such increase is not expected to have significant impact on our income tax provision we file income tax

result in exclusivity the court also found that our practice of not licensing competitor cellular modem chip violated our commitment to certain standard development organization and duty under the antitrust law to license competing cellular modem chip maker and helped maintain our royalty at unreasonably high level finally the court found that incentive fund entered into with certain oems further harmed competing cellular modem chip maker ability to undermine our monopoly position prevented rival from entering the market and restricted the sale of those competitor that do enter the court concluded that the combined effect of our conduct together with our monopoly power harmed the competitive process the court imposed the following injunctive relief we must not condition the supply of cellular modem chip on customer patent license status and we must negotiate or renegotiate license term with customer in good faith under condition free from the threat of lack of access to or discriminatory provision of cellular modem chip supply or associated technical support or access to software we must make exhaustive cellular standard essential patent license available to cellular modem chip supplier on fair reasonable and non discriminatory frand term and submit necessary to arbitral or judicial dispute resolution to determine such term we may not enter into express or de facto exclusive dealing agreement for the supply of cellular modem chip and we may not interfere with the ability of any customer to communicate with government agency about potential law enforcement or regulatory matter the court also ordered to submit to compliance and monitoring procedure for period of seven year and to report to the ftc on an annual basis regarding our compliance with the above remedy we disagree with the court conclusion interpretation of the fact and application of the law on may we filed with the court notice of appeal to the united state court of appeal for the ninth circuit ninth circuit on july we filed motion for partial stay of injunction pending appeal and consent motion to expedite appeal in the ninth incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementscircuit on august the ninth circuit granted our motion for partial stay thus pending the resolution of the appeal in the ninth circuit or until further order of the ninth circuit the portion of the district court injunction requiring that we must make exhaustive cellular standard essential patent license available to cellular modem chip supplier and ii not condition the supply of cellular modem chip on customer patent license status and must negotiate or renegotiate license term with customer are stayed on july the ninth circuit granted our motion to expedite appeal on february the ninth circuit heard oral argument on august the ninth circuit issued it opinion which reversed the district court judgment vacated it injunction and vacated it partial grant of summary judgment the ninth circuit stated that the district court erred in holding that we are under an antitrust duty to license rival chip manufacturer and noted that our practice of licensing our standard essential patent exclusively at the oem level doe not violate the antitrust law the ninth circuit also held that the district court anticompetitive surcharge theory failed to state cogent theory of anticompetitive harm and that our patent licensing royalty and no license no chip policy do not impose an anticompetitive surcharge on rival modem chip sale and do not undermine competition in either the cdma or premium lte chip market while agreeing with the district court that our and agreement with apple were structured like exclusive dealing contract the ninth circuit nonetheless held that neither agreement had the actual or practical effect of substantially foreclosing competition in the cdma modem chip market and because apple terminated these agreement year ago the district court had improperly issued an injunction the ninth circuit noted that neither the sherman act nor any other law prohibits company like from licensing their standard essential patent independently from their chip sale and collecting royalty and or limiting their chip customer base to licensed oems on september the ftc filed petition for rehearing en banc on october the ninth circuit denied the ftc petition contingent loss and other consideration we will continue to vigorously defend in the foregoing matter however litigation and investigation are inherently uncertain and we face difficulty in evaluating or estimating likely outcome or range of possible loss in antitrust and trade regulation investigation in particular other than with respect to the ec fine we have not recorded any accrual
