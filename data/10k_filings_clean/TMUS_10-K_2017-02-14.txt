branded location and third party and national retailer location well distribution through our website of december our distribution density in major metropolitan area provides customer with the convenience of retail and service location close to where they live and work competitionthe wireless telecommunication industry is highly competitive we are the third largest provider of postpaid service plan and the largest provider of prepaid service plan in the measured by customer our competitor include other national carrier such at inc at verizon communication inc verizon and sprint corporation at and verizon are significantly larger than and may enjoy greater resource and scale advantage compared to in addition our competitor include numerous smaller regional carrier existing mvnos such tracfone wireless inc and future mvnos such comcast corporation and charter communication inc many of which offer or plan to offer no contract prepaid service plan competitor also include provider who offer similar communication service such voice and messaging using alternative technology or service competitive factor within the wireless telecommunication industry include pricing market saturation service and product offering customer experience network investment and quality development and deployment of technology availability of additional spectrum license and regulatory change competitor have shown willingness to use aggressive pricing source of differentiation other competitor have sought to add ancillary service like mobile video to enhance their offering taken together the competitive factor we face continue to put pressure on margin company compete to retain the current customer base and continue to add new customer employeesas of december we employed approximately full time and part time employee including network retail administrative and customer support function regulationthe fcc regulates many key aspect of our business including licensing construction the operation and use of our network modification of our network control and ownership of our license and authorization the sale transfer and acquisition of certain license domestic roaming arrangement and interconnection agreement pursuant to it authority under the communication act of amended communication act the fcc ha number of complex requirement and proceeding that affect our operation and that could increase our cost or diminish our revenue for example the fcc ha rule regarding provision of and service porting telephone number interconnection roaming internet openness or net neutrality disability access privacy and cybersecurity consumer protection and the universal service and lifeline program many of these and other issue are being considered in ongoing proceeding and we can not predict whether or how such action will affect our business financial condition or result of operation our ability to provide service and generate revenue could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or change to existing law and regulation in addition regulation of company that offer competing service can impact our business indirectly wireless communication provider must be licensed by the fcc to provide communication service at specified spectrum frequency within specified geographic area and must comply with the rule and policy governing the use of the spectrum adopted by the fcc the fcc issue each license for fixed period of time typically year in the case of cellular pc and point to point microwave license aws license have an initial term of year with successive year term thereafter while the fcc ha generally renewed license given to operating company like the fcc ha authority to both revoke license for cause and to deny license renewal if renewal is not in the public interest furthermore we could be subject to fine forfeiture and other penalty for failure to comply with fcc regulation even if any such non compliance wa unintentional in extreme case penalty can include revocation of our license the loss of any license or any related fine or forfeiture could adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition additionally congress and the fcc allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service cmrs which includes cellular pc and specialized mobile radio could significantly increase competition we can not ass the impact that any development that may occur in the economy or any future spectrum allocation by the fcc may have on license value fcc spectrum auction and other market development may adversely affect the market value of our license in the future significant decline in the value of our license could adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation in addition the fcc periodically review it policy on how to evaluate carrier spectrum holding change in these policy could affect spectrum resource and competition among and other carrier of contentscongress and the fcc have imposed limitation on foreign ownership of cmrs licensee that exceed direct ownership or indirect ownership the fcc ha ruled that higher level of indirect foreign ownership even up to are presumptively consistent with the public interest albeit subject to review consistent with that established policy the fcc ha issued declaratory ruling authorizing up to ownership of our company by deutsche telekom this declaratory ruling and our license are conditioned on deutsche telekom and the company compliance with network security agreement with the department of justice the federal bureau of investigation and the department of homeland security failure to comply with the term of this agreement could result in fine injunction and other penalty including potential revocation of our spectrum license while the communication act generally preempt state and local government from regulating the entry of or the rate charged by wireless communication provider certain state and local government regulate other term and condition of wireless service including billing termination of service arrangement and the imposition of early termination fee advertising network outage the use of device while driving zoning and land use additionally the federal trade commission ftc and other federal agency have asserted that they have jurisdiction over some consumer protection and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practice with respect to the provision of non common carrier service the fcc and the federal aviation administration regulate the siting lighting and construction of transmitter tower and antenna tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning well federal statute regarding environmental and historic preservation the future cost to comply with all relevant regulation are to some extent unknown and change to regulation or the applicability of regulation could result in higher operating and

website item risk factorsin addition to the other information contained in this form the following risk factor should be considered carefully in evaluating mobile our business financial condition liquidity or operating result well the price of our common stock and other security could be materially adversely affected by any of these risk risk related to our business and the wireless industry the scarcity and cost of additional wireless spectrum and regulation relating to spectrum use may adversely affect our business strategy and financial performance we will need to acquire additional spectrum in order to continue our customer growth expand and deepen our coverage maintain our quality of service meet increasing customer demand and deploy new technology we will be at competitive disadvantage and possibly experience erosion in the quality of service in certain market if we fail to gain access to necessary spectrum reaching capacity result we are actively seeking to make additional investment in spectrum which could be significant of contentsthe continued interest in and acquisition of spectrum by existing carrier and others may reduce our ability to acquire and or raise the cost of acquiring spectrum in the secondary market or negatively impact our ability to gain access to spectrum through other mean including government auction we may need to enter into spectrum sharing or leasing arrangement which are subject to certain risk and uncertainty and may involve significant expenditure although the fcc is conducting an auction for low band spectrum in which we are participating gaining access to that spectrum may take up to three year or more any material delay could adversely impact our ability to implement our plan and effort to improve our network in addition our return on investment in spectrum depends on our ability to attract additional customer and to provide additional service and usage to existing customer result the return on any investment in spectrum that we make may not be much we anticipate or take longer than expected additionally we may be unable to secure the spectrum we need in any auction we may elect to participate in or in the secondary market on favorable term or at all the fcc may impose condition on the use of new wireless broadband mobile spectrum including new restriction or rule governing the use or access to current or future spectrum this could increase pressure on capacity additional condition that may be imposed by the fcc include heightened build out requirement limited renewal right clearing obligation or open access or net neutrality requirement that may make it le attractive or le economical to acquire spectrum in addition rule may be established for future government spectrum auction that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configuration or coverage area if we can not acquire needed spectrum from the government or otherwise if competitor acquire spectrum that will allow them to provide service competitive with our service or if we can not deploy service over acquired spectrum on timely basis without burdensome condition at reasonable cost and while maintaining network quality level then our ability to attract and retain customer and our associated financial performance could be materially adversely affected competition industry consolidation and change in the market for wireless service could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain customer and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result we have multiple wireless competitor some of which have greater resource than and compete for customer based principally on service device offering price network coverage speed and quality and customer service we expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industry customer growth rate to be moderate in comparison with historical growth rate or possibly negative leading to ongoing competition for customer customer churn may increase the wireless industry shift away from service contract we also expect that our customer appetite for data service will place increasing demand on our network capacity this competition and our capacity will continue to put pressure on pricing and margin company compete for potential customer our ability to compete will depend on among other thing continued absolute and relative improvement in network quality and customer service effective marketing and selling of product and service attractive pricing and cost management all of which will involve significant expense joint venture merger acquisition and strategic alliance in the wireless sector have resulted in and are expected to result in larger competitor competing for limited number of customer the two largest national wireless communication provider currently serve significant percentage of all wireless customer and hold significant spectrum and other resource our largest competitor may be able to enter into exclusive handset device or content arrangement execute pervasive advertising and marketing campaign or otherwise improve their cost position relative to in addition refusal of our large competitor to provide critical access to resource and input such roaming service on reasonable term could improve their position within the wireless broadband mobile service industry we are also facing competition from other service provider industry sector converge such telecom service and content satellite wireless and fiber and other service provider company like comcast and at directv and at proposed acquisition of time warner will have the scale and asset to aggressively compete in converging industry verizon is also significant competitor focusing on premium content offering well acquisition and proposed acquisition like aol and yahoo to diversify outside of core wireless further some of our competitor provide content service in addition to voice and broadband service and consumer are increasingly accessing video content from internet based provider and application all of which create increased competition in this area these factor together with the effect of the increasing aggregate penetration of wireless service in all metropolitan area and the ability of our larger competitor to use resource to build out their network and to quickly deploy advanced technology could make it more difficult for to continue to attract and retain customer and may adversely affect our competitive position and ability to grow which would have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result of contentsif we are unable to take advantage of technological development on timely basis we may experience decline in demand for our service or face challenge in implementing or evolving our business strategy significant technological change continue to impact the communication industry in general these technological change enhance communication and enable broader array of company to offer service competitive with ours in order to grow and remain competitive with new and evolving technology in our industry we will need to adapt to future change in technology continually invest in our network enhance our existing offering and introduce new offering to address our current and potential customer changing demand enhancing our network such deploying is subject to risk from equipment change and migration of customer from existing spectrum band and the potential inability to secure spectrum necessary to deploy advanced technology adopting new and sophisticated technology may result in implementation issue such scheduling and supplier delay unexpected or increased cost technological constraint regulatory permitting issue customer dissatisfaction and other issue that could cause delay in launching new technological capability which in turn could result in significant cost or reduce the anticipated benefit of the upgrade in general the development of new service in the wireless telecommunication industry will require to anticipate and respond to the continuously changing demand of our customer which we may not be able to do accurately or timely we could experience material adverse effect on our business operation financial condition and operating result if our new service fail to retain or gain acceptance in the marketplace or if cost associated with these service are higher than anticipated we could be harmed by data loss or other security breach whether directly or by way of third party our business like that of most retailer and wireless company involves the receipt storage and transmission of confidential information including sensitive personal information and payment card information confidential information about our employee and supplier and other sensitive information about our company such our business plan transaction and intellectual property confidential information unauthorized access may be difficult to anticipate detect or prevent particularly given that the method of unauthorized access constantly change and evolve we may experience unauthorized access or distribution of confidential information by third party or employee error or breach by third party supplier or other breach of security that compromise the integrity of confidential information and such breach can have materially adverse effect on our business or damage our reputation in addition cyber attack such denial of service and other malicious attack could disrupt our internal system and application impair our ability to provide service to our customer and have other adverse effect on our business and that of others who depend on our service telecommunication carrier we are considered critical infrastructure provider and therefore may be more likely to be the target of such attack such attack against company may be perpetrated by variety of group or person including those in jurisdiction where law enforcement is or ha been unable to effectively address such attack in addition we provide confidential proprietary and personal information to third party service provider when it is necessary to pursue business objective we and our third party service provider have been subject to unauthorized access to confidential information in the past including breach at one of our credit check provider in september in which subset of record containing current and potential customer information wa compromised by an external party although we regularly review our procedure and safeguard to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and to defend against attack seeking to disrupt our service the ever evolving threat landscape requires to continually evaluate and adapt our system and process we can not assure that the preventive action we take will be adequate to repel significant attack or prevent information security breach or the misuse of data unauthorized access by third party or employee or exploit against third party supplier environment if we are subject to such attack or compromise we may incur significant cost be subject to regulatory investigation sanction and private litigation experience disruption to our operation or suffer damage to our reputation although the cyber attack that we and our third party service provider have been subjected to in the past have not caused significant harm to our company future cyber attack may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result system failure and business disruption may allow unauthorized use of or interference with our network and other system which could be materially adversely affect our reputation and financial condition to be successful we must provide our customer with reliable trustworthy service and protect the communication location and personal information shared or generated by our customer we rely upon both our system and network and the system and network of other provider and supplier to provide and support our service and in some case protect our customer and our information failure of our or others system network or infrastructure may prevent from providing reliable service or may allow for the unauthorized use of or interference with our network and other system or for the compromise of of contentscustomer information example of these risk include human error such responding to deceptive communication or unintentionally executing malicious code physical damage power surge or outage or equipment failure including those result of severe weather natural disaster terrorist attack and act of war theft of customer and or proprietary information offered for sale for competitive advantage or corporate extortion unauthorized access to our it and business system or to our network and critical infrastructure and those of our supplier and other provider supplier failure or delay and system failure or outage of our business system or communication network such event could cause to lose customer lose revenue incur expense suffer reputational and goodwill damage and subject to litigation or governmental investigation remediation cost could include liability for information loss repairing infrastructure and system and or cost of incentive offered to customer our insurance may not cover or be adequate to fully reimburse for cost and loss associated with such event we are in the process of implementing new billing system which will support portion of our subscriber while maintaining our legacy billing system any unanticipated difficulty disruption or significant delay could have adverse operational financial and reputational effect on our business we are currently implementing new customer billing system which involves new third party supported platform and utilization of phased deployment approach post implementation we plan to operate both the existing and new billing system in parallel to aid in the transition to the new system until all phase of the conversion are complete the implementation may cause major system or business disruption or we may fail to implement the new billing system in timely or effective manner in addition the third party billing service supporting vendor may experience error cyber attack or other operational disruption that could negatively impact and over which we may have limited control interruption and or failure of this new billing service system could disrupt our operation and impact our ability to provide or bill for our service retain customer attract new customer or negatively impact overall customer experience any occurrence of the foregoing could cause material adverse effect on our operation and financial condition material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and reputational damage we rely on third party to provide product or service for the operation of our business and failure or inability by such party to provide these product or service could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result we depend heavily on supplier their subcontractor and other third party in order for to efficiently operate our business our business is complex and it is not unusual for multiple vendor located in multiple location to help to develop maintain and troubleshoot product and service such network component software development service and billing and customer service support our supplier may provide service outside of the united state which carry associated additional regulatory and legal obligation we generally rely upon the supplier to provide contractual assurance and accurate information regarding risk associated with their provision of product or service in accordance with our expectation and standard such our supplier code of conduct and our third party risk management standard and they may fail to do generally there are multiple source for the type of product and service we purchase or use however we currently rely on limited number of supplier for billing service voice and data communication transport service network infrastructure equipment handset other device and payment processing service among other product and service disruption or failure of such supplier to adequately perform could have material adverse effect on our business operation and financial performance in the past our supplier contractor and third party retailer may not have always performed at

radio spectrum is used by licensee the nature of the service that licensee may offer and how the service may be offered and resolution of issue of interference between spectrum band additionally the ftc and other federal agency have asserted that they have jurisdiction over some consumer protection and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practice with respect to the provision of wireless product and service we are subject to regulatory oversight by various federal state and local agency well judicial review and action on issue related to the wireless industry that include

to the embassy of iran in those european country gross revenue and net profit recorded from these activity in were le than million we understand that deutsche telekom intends to continue these activity critical accounting policy and estimatesour significant accounting policy are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and result they require the use of estimate and assumption which affect the financial statement and accompanying note see note summary of significant accounting policy of the note to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii item of this form for further information these policy are critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgment about matter that are inherently uncertain these estimate are inherently subject to judgment and actual result could differ from those estimate allowanceswe maintain an allowance for estimated loss inherent in the account receivable and eip receivable portfolio when determining the allowance we consider number of factor including historical experience and current collection trend aging of the receivable portfolio credit quality of the customer base and other qualitative factor such macro economic condition credit collection risk are assessed for each type of receivable such eip receivables based upon historical and expected write offs net of recovery and an analysis of the aged receivable balance with reserve generally increasing the receivable age to the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trend or assumption the required allowance amount could differ from the estimate we write off account balance if collection effort are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible based on customer credit rating and the length of time from the original billing date we offer certain retail customer the option to pay for their device and other purchase in installment over period of up to month using an eip at the time of an installment sale we impute discount for interest there is no stated rate of interest on the eip receivables and record the eip receivables at their present value which is determined by discounting future payment at the imputed interest rate the difference between the present value of the eip receivables and their face amount result in discount which is recorded direct reduction to the carrying value with corresponding reduction to equipment revenue we determine the imputed discount rate based primarily on current market interest rate and the amount of expected credit loss on the eip receivables result we do not recognize separate valuation allowance at the time of issuance the effect of uncertainty about future cash flow are included in the initial present value measurement of the receivable the imputed discount on eip receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized interest income in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount we ass the need for and if necessary recognize an allowance for credit loss to the extent the amount of estimated probable loss on the gross eip receivables exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balance total imputed discount and allowance of december and wa approximately and respectively of the total amount of gross account receivable including eip receivables depreciationdepreciation commences asset have been placed in service we generally depreciate property and equipment over the period the property and equipment provide economic benefit leased wireless device are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to mobile which is generally the lease term depreciable life study are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable life for certain category of property plant and equipment these study take into account actual usage physical wear and tear replacement history assumption about technology evolution and expected loss of leased wireless device when these factor indicate that an asset useful life is different from the previous assessment the remaining book value are depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining of contentsestimated useful life see note summary of significant accounting policy and note property and equipment of the note to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii item of this form for information regarding depreciation of asset including management underlying estimate of useful life evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset for impairmentwe ass the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset such our spectrum license for potential impairment annually of december or more frequently if event or change in circumstance indicate that asset might be impaired we may elect to first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is le than it carrying amount basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test if we do not perform qualitative assessment or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is le than it carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment based on two step test in the first step we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying value the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using market approach which is based on market capitalization we recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor change in market capitalization to determine whether decline if any necessitate an interim impairment review in the event market capitalization doe decline below it book value we will consider the length severity and reason for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists including considering whether control premium should be added to the market capitalization we believe short term fluctuation in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value in the second step we determine the fair value of all of the asset and liability of the reporting unit including those that currently may not be recorded the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the sum of the fair value of all of those asset and liability represents the implied goodwill amount if the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than the carrying amount of goodwill then an impairment loss is recognized for the difference we test spectrum license for impairment on an aggregate basis consistent with the management of the overall business at national level we may elect to first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset group is le than it carrying value if we do not perform the qualitative assessment or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset group is le than it carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group if the carrying amount of spectrum license exceeds the fair value an impairment loss is recognized we estimate the fair value of the spectrum license using the greenfield approach which is an income approach that estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participant at the measurement date under current market condition the greenfield approach value the spectrum license by calculating the cash flow generating potential of hypothetical start up company that go into business with no asset except the asset to be valued in this case spectrum license the value of the spectrum license can be considered equal to the present value of the cash flow of this hypothetical start up company we base the assumption underlying the greenfield approach on combination of market participant data and our historical result trend and business plan future cash flow in the greenfield approach are based on estimate and assumption of market participant revenue ebitda margin network build out period and long term growth rate for market participant the cash flow are discounted using weighted average cost of capital the valuation approach utilized to estimate fair value for the purpose of the impairment test of goodwill and spectrum license require the use of assumption and estimate which involve degree of uncertainty if actual result or future expectation are not consistent with the assumption this may result in the recording of significant impairment charge on goodwill or spectrum license the most significant assumption within the valuation model are the discount rate revenue ebitda margin and the long term growth rate see note summary of significant accounting policy and note goodwill spectrum license and other intangible asset of the note to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii item of this form for information regarding our annual impairment test and impairment charge guarantee liability in we introduced device trade in program upgrade phone jump which provides eligible customer specified price trade in right to upgrade their device participating customer must finance the purchase of device on an eip and have qualifying mobile monthly wireless service plan which is treated single multiple element arrangement when entered into at or near the same time upon qualifying jump program upgrade the customer remaining eip balance is settled provided they trade in their eligible used device in good working condition and purchase new device from on new eip of contentsfor customer who enroll in jump we defer and recognize liability for the portion of revenue which represents the estimated fair value of the specified price trade in right guarantee the guarantee liability is valued based on various economic and customer behavioral assumption which requires judgment including estimating the customer remaining eip balance at trade in the expected fair value of the used device at trade in and the probability and timing of trade in when customer upgrade their device the difference between the eip balance credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned device is recorded against the guarantee liability all assumption are reviewed periodically rent expense most of the lease on our tower site have fixed rent escalation which provide for periodic increase in the amount of rent payable over time we calculate straight line rent expense for each of these lease based on the fixed non cancellable term of the lease plus all period if any for which failure to renew the lease imposes penalty on in such amount that renewal appears at lease inception or significant modification to be reasonably assured we consider several factor in assessing whether renewal period are reasonably assured of being exercised including the continued maturation of our network nationwide technological advance within the telecommunication industry and the availability of alternative site we make significant assumption at lease inception in determining and assessing the factor that constitute penalty in doing so we primarily consider cost incurred in acquiring and developing new site the useful life of site improvement and equipment cost future economic condition and the extent to which improvement in wireless technology can be incorporated into current assessment of whether an economic compulsion will exist in the future to renew lease income taxeswe recognize deferred tax asset and liability based on temporary difference between the financial statement and tax basis of asset and liability using enacted tax rate expected to be in effect when these difference are realized valuation allowance is maintained against deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction within the carryforward period available we consider many factor when determining whether valuation allowance is needed including recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction expectation of future income the carryforward period available for tax reporting purpose and other relevant factor we account for uncertainty in income tax recognized in the financial statement in accordance with the accounting guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return we ass whether it is more likely than not that tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merit of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefit in light of change in fact and circumstance such change in tax law interaction

renewal routinely and at nominal cost the spectrum license held by expire at various date we believe we will be able to meet all requirement necessary to secure renewal of our spectrum license at nominal cost moreover we determined there are currently no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factor that limit the useful life of our spectrum license therefore we determined the spectrum license should be treated indefinite lived intangible asset at time we enter into agreement to sell or exchange spectrum license upon entering into the arrangement if the transaction ha

qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is le than it carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment based on two step test in the first step we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using market approach which is based on market capitalization if the fair value is le than the carrying value the second step is performed in the second step we determine the fair value of all of the asset and liability of the reporting unit including those that may not be currently recorded the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the sum of the fair value of all of those asset and liability represents the implied goodwill amount if the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than it carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized for the difference we test our spectrum license for impairment on an aggregate basis consistent with our

group is le than it carrying value if we do not perform the qualitative assessment or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset group is le than it carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group if the estimated fair value of the spectrum license is lower than their carrying amount an impairment

defined an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date the three tier hierarchy for input used in measuring fair value which prioritizes the input based on the observability of the measurement date is follows level price in active market for identical asset or liability level input other than the quoted price in active market for identical asset and liability andlevel input for which there is little or no market data which require to develop assumption of market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability asset and liability are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value

pronouncement adopted during the current yearin march the financial accounting standard board the fasb issued accounting standard update asu compensation stock compensation topic improvement to employee share based payment accounting which simplifies several aspect of the accounting for shared based payment transaction including income tax consequence classification of award either equity or liability and classification on the statement of cash flow we elected to adopt this standard effective of january the impact on our consolidated financial statement from the adoption of this standard are follows consolidated balance sheet million decrease to the january accumulated deficit balance from the recognition on modified retrospective basis of all previously unrecognized income tax attribute related to share based payment consolidated statement of comprehensive income on prospective basis all excess tax benefit and deficiency related to share based payment will be recognized through income tax expense prior period amount were not adjusted and consolidated statement of cash flow on prospective basis permitted excess tax benefit related to share based payment will be presented operating activity prior period amount were not adjusted in april the fasb issued asu simplifying the presentation of debt issuance cost the standard requires debt issuance cost related to recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discount the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance cost are not affected we adopted this new guidance in the first quarter of and applied the change retrospectively the implementation of this standard did not have significant impact on our consolidated financial statement in august the fasb issued asu disclosure of uncertainty about an entity ability to continue going concern the standard requires to ass our ability to continue going concern each interim and annual reporting period and provide certain disclosure if there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue going concern including management plan to alleviate the substantial doubt we adopted this new guidance in the fourth quarter of the implementation of this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statement accounting pronouncement not yet adopted in may the fasb issued asu revenue from contract with customer asu and ha since modified the standard with several asu the standard requires entity to recognize revenue through the application of five step model which includes the identification of the contract identification of the performance obligation determination of the transaction price allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation and recognition of revenue the entity satisfies the performance obligation the standard becomes effective for beginning january however early adoption with the original effective date for period beginning january is permitted we plan to adopt the standard when it becomes effective for beginning january of contentsthe guidance permit two method of adoption the full retrospective method applying the standard to each prior reporting period presented or the modified retrospective method with cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application the standard also allows entity to apply certain practical expedient at their discretion we currently anticipate adopting the standard using the modified retrospective method with cumulative catch up adjustment and providing additional disclosure comparing result to previous rule we continue to evaluate the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statement but anticipate this standard will have material impact on our consolidated financial statement while we are continuing to ass all potential impact of the standard we currently believe the most significant impact may include the following item whether our eip contract contain significant financing component which is similar to our current practice of imputing interest and would similarly impact the amount of revenue recognized at the time of an eip sale and whether or not portion of the revenue is recognized interest rather than equipment revenue we currently expense contract acquisition cost and believe that the requirement to defer incremental contract acquisition cost and recognize them over the term of the initial contract and anticipated renewal contract to which the cost relate will have significant impact to our consolidated financial statement whether bill credit earned over time result in extended service contract which would impact the allocation and timing of revenue between service revenue and equipment revenue overall with the exception of the aforementioned impact we do not expect that the new standard will result in substantive change to the method of allocation of contract revenue between various service and equipment to the timing of when revenue are recognized for most of our service contract we are still in the process of evaluating these impact and our initial assessment may change we continue to refine our system process and assumption we are in the process of implementing significant new revenue accounting system process and internal control over revenue recognition which will ultimately assist in the application of the new standard in february the fasb issued asu lease the standard requires all lessee to report right of use asset and lease liability for most lease the income statement recognition is similar to existing lease accounting and is based on lease classification the standard requires lessee and lessor to classify most lease using principle similar to existing lease accounting but eliminates the bright line classification test for lessor the standard modifies the classification criterion and the accounting for sale type and direct financing lease the standard will become effective for beginning january and will require recognizing and measuring lease at the beginning of the earliest period presented using modified retrospective approach early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the standard and the timing of adoption but expect that it will have material impact on our consolidated financial statement in june the fasb issued asu financial instrument credit loss topic measurement of credit loss on financial instrument the standard requires financial asset or group of financial asset measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected the measurement of expected credit loss is based on relevant information about past event including historical experience current condition and reasonable and supportable forecast that affect the collectibility of the reported amount the standard will become effective for beginning january and will require cumulative effect adjustment to accumulated deficit of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective that is modified retrospective approach early adoption is permitted for of january we are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statement and the timing of adoption in august the fasb issued asu statement of cash flow topic classification of certain cash receipt and cash payment the standard provides guidance on how certain cash receipt and payment are presented and classified in the statement of cash flow including beneficial interest in securitization which would impact the presentation of the deferred purchase price from sale of receivables the standard is intended to reduce current diversity in practice the standard will become effective for beginning january and will require retrospective approach early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period we are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statement and the timing of adoption in october the fasb issued asu accounting for income tax intra entity transfer of asset other than inventory the standard requires that the income tax impact of intra entity sale and transfer of property except for of contentsinventory be recognized when the transfer occurs the standard will become effective for beginning january and will require any deferred tax not yet recognized on intra entity transfer to be recorded to retained earnings under modified retrospective approach early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the standard but expect that it will not have material impact on our consolidated financial statement in november the fasb issued asu statement of cash flow topic restricted cash the standard requires entity to include in their cash and cash equivalent balance in the statement of cash flow those amount that are deemed to be restricted cash and restricted cash equivalent the asu doe not define the term restricted cash and restricted cash equivalent the standard will be effective for beginning january and will require retrospective approach early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the standard but expect that it will not have material impact on our consolidated financial statement in january the fasb issued asu intangible goodwill and other topic simplifying the test for goodwill impairment the standard eliminates the requirement to measure the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of reporting unit to all asset and liability within that unit the step test from the goodwill impairment test instead if the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds it fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess limited by the amount of goodwill in that reporting unit the standard will become effective for beginning january and must be applied to any annual or interim goodwill impairment assessment after that date early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the standard but expect that it will not have material impact on our consolidated financial statement note equipment installment plan receivableswe offer certain retail customer the option to pay for their device and accessory in installment over period of up to month
