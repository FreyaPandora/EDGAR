method and product emphasis in various country to meet local customer need human pharmaceutical in the most of our pharmaceutical product are distributed through wholesaler that serve pharmacy physician and other health care professional and hospital in and three wholesale distributor in the mckesson corporation amerisourcebergen corporation and cardinal health inc each accounted for percent and percent of our consolidated total revenue no other distributor accounted for more percent of our consolidated total revenue in any of those year we promote our major human pharmaceutical product in the through sale representative who call upon physician and other health care professional we also promote to healthcare provider in medical journal and on line health care channel distribute literature and sample of certain product to physician and exhibit at medical meeting in addition we advertise certain product directly to consumer in the and we maintain website with information about our major product we supplement our employee sale force with contract sale organization to leverage our own resource maintain special business group to service wholesaler pharmacy benefit manager managed care organization group purchasing organization government and long term care institution hospital and certain retail pharmacy we enter into arrangement with these organization providing for discount or rebate on our product human pharmaceutical outside the outside the we promote our human pharmaceutical product to healthcare provider primarily through sale representative and on line health care channel the product marketed vary from country to country endocrinology product constitute the largest single group in consolidated revenue distribution pattern vary from country to country in most country in which we operate we maintain our own sale organization but in some smaller country we market our product through independent distributor human pharmaceutical marketing collaborationscertain of our human pharmaceutical product are marketed in arrangement with other pharmaceutical company including the following we and boehringer ingelheim have diabetes

right in japan and certain other country for additional information see item financial statement and supplementary data note collaboration and other arrangement animal health productsour elanco animal health business unit employ field salesperson throughout the and ha an extensive sale force outside the elanco sell it product primarily to wholesale distributor and promotes it product primarily to producer and veterinarian for food animal product and to veterinarian for companion animal product elanco also advertises certain companion animal product directly to pet owner in market where it is consistent with allowable promotional practice competitionour human pharmaceutical product compete globally with product of many other company in highly competitive market our animal health product compete globally with product of animal health care company well pharmaceutical chemical and other company that operate animal health business important competitive factor for both human pharmaceutical and animal health product include effectiveness safety and ease of use price and demonstrated cost effectiveness marketing effectiveness and research and development of new product process and us most new product that we introduce must compete with other branded or generic product already on the market or product that are later developed by competitor if competitor introduce new product or delivery system with therapeutic or cost advantage our product can be subject to decreased sale progressive price reduction or both we believe our long term competitive success depends upon discovering and developing either alone or in collaboration with others or acquiring innovative cost effective human pharmaceutical and animal health product that provide improved outcome and deliver value to payer and continuously improving the productivity of our operation in highly competitive environment can be no assurance that our effort will result in commercially successful product and it is possible that our product will be or become uncompetitive from time to time result of product developed by our competitor generic pharmaceuticalsone of the biggest competitive challenge we face is from generic pharmaceutical in the and the eu the regulatory approval process for human pharmaceutical other than biological product biologics exempts generic from costly and time consuming clinical trial to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturer to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product therefore generic manufacturer invest far le than we do in research and development and can price their product much lower than our branded product accordingly branded non biologic human pharmaceutical loses it market exclusivity it normally face intense price competition from generic form of the product public and private payer typically encourage the use of generic alternative to brand name drug in their healthcare program law in the generally allow and in many case require pharmacist to substitute generic drug that have been rated under government procedure to be essentially equivalent to brand name drug where substitution is mandatory it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it in many country outside the intellectual property protection is weak and we must compete with generic or counterfeit version of our product many of our animal health product also compete with generic biosimilarsseveral of our current product including cyramza erbitux trulicity taltz and emgality and many of the new molecular entity nmes in our research pipeline are biologics competition for lilly biologics may be affected by the approval of follow on biologics also known biosimilars biosimilar is subsequent version of an approved innovator biologic that due to it functional and structural similarity to the innovator biologic is approved based on an abbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing required of the innovator biologic globally most government have developed regulatory pathway to approve biosimilars alternative to innovator developed biologics but the patent and regulatory exclusivity for the existing innovator biologic must expire in given market biosimilars may enter that market the extent to which biosimilar once approved will be substituted for the innovator biologic in way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non biologic product is not yet entirely clear and will depend on number of regulatory and marketplace factor that are still developing biosimilars may present both competitive challenge and opportunity for example competitor company ha developed version of insulin lispro which competes with our product humalog on the other hand with our partner boehringer ingelheim we developed basaglar new insulin glargine product which ha the amino acid sequence the product currently marketed by competitor and ha launched follow on biologic in the and biosimilar in the eu and japan private sector dynamicsin the private sector consolidation and integration among healthcare provider is also major factor in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceutical health plan and pharmacy benefit manager have been consolidating into fewer larger entity thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance for example in cv health large pharmacy benefit manager and pharmacy chain acquired aetna large national insurer and cigna corporation acquired express script in similar transaction payer typically maintain formulary which specify coverage the condition under which drug are included on plan formulary and reimbursement the associated of pocket cost to the consumer formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restriction such prior authorization and formulary exclusion or due to reimbursement limitation which result in higher consumer out of pocket cost such non preferred co pay tier increased co insurance level and higher deductible consequently pharmaceutical company compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attribute such efficacy safety profile or patient ease of use but also by providing rebate value based agreement where pricing is based on achievement or not of specified outcome are another tool which may be utilized between payer and pharmaceutical company formulary placement and pricing are negotiated price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decision particularly in treatment area in which the payer ha taken the position that multiple branded product are therapeutically comparable these downward pricing pressure could continue to negatively affect our future consolidated result of operation patent trademark and other intellectual property rightsoverviewintellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life science innovation and invest in the search for new medicine we own have applied for or are licensed under large number of patent in the and many other country relating to product product us formulation and manufacturing process in addition discussed for some product we have additional effective intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory law the patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to human pharmaceutical is provided by national patent claiming the active ingredient the compound patent particularly those in major market such the various european country and japan these patent may be issued based upon the filing of international patent application usually filed under the patent cooperation treaty pct patent application covering the compound are generally filed during the discovery research phase of the drug discovery process which is described in the research and development section below in general national patent in each relevant country are available for period of year from the filing date of the pct application which is often year prior to the launch of commercial product patent term adjustment and restoration may extend the original patent term patent term adjustment is statutory right available to all patent applicant to provide relief in the event that patent grant is delayed during examination by the united state patent and trademark office uspto patent term restoration is statutory right provided to patent holder that claim invention subject to review by the food and drug administration fda to make for portion of the time invested in clinical trial and the fda review process single patent for human pharmaceutical product may be eligible for patent term restoration patent term restoration is limited by formula and can not be calculated product approval due to uncertainty about the duration of clinical trial and the time it take the fda to review an application there is five year cap on any restoration and no patent may be extended for more than year beyond fda approval some country outside the also offer form of patent term restoration for example supplementary protection certificate are sometimes available to extend the life of european patent up to an additional five year similarly in japan south korea and australia patent term can be extended up to five year depending on the length of regulatory review and other factor loss of effective patent protection for human pharmaceutical typically result in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product which often result in severe and rapid decline in revenue for the product however in some case the innovator company may be protected from approval of generic or other follow on version of new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through manufacturing trade secret later expiring patent on manufacturing process method of use or formulation or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory law the primary form of data protection are follows regulatory authority in major market generally grant data package protection for period of year following new drug approval in recognition of the substantial investment required to complete clinical trial data package protection prohibits other manufacturer from submitting regulatory application for marketing approval based on the innovator company regulatory submission data for the drug the base period of data package protection depends on the country for example the period is generally five year in the year for new biologics described below effectively year in the eu and eight year in japan the period begin on the date of product approval and run concurrently with the patent term for any relevant patent under the biologics price competition and innovation act of the bpci act the fda ha the authority to approve biosimilars competitor seeking approval of biosimilar must file an application to show it molecule is highly similar to an approved innovator biologic and include certain amount of safety and efficacy data that the fda will determine on case by case basis under the data protection provision of this law the fda can not approve biosimilar application until year after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic subject to certain condition in the the fda ha the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drug where the sponsor conduct specified testing in pediatric or adolescent population within specified time period if granted this pediatric exclusivity provides an additional six month of exclusivity which is added to the term of data protection well to the term of any relevant patent to the extent these protection have not already expired while the term of the pediatric exclusivity attache to the term of any relevant patent pediatric exclusivity is regulatory exclusivity bar to generic approval not patent right under the orphan drug law specific use of drug or biologic can receive orphan designation if it is intended to treat disease or condition affecting fewer than people in the or affecting more than people but not reasonably expected to recover it development and marketing cost through sale among other benefit orphan designation entitles the particular use of the drug to seven year of market exclusivity meaning that the fda can not with limited exception approve another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication until expiration of the seven year period unlike pediatric exclusivity the orphan exclusivity period is independent of and run in parallel with any applicable patent the major market the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for human pharmaceutical varies widely and in number of these market we are unable to patent our product or to enforce the patent we receive for our product under the trade related aspect of intellectual property agreement trip administered by the world trade organization more than country have agreed to provide non discriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical invention and to assure that adequate and effective right are available to patent owner implementation of this agreement differs between developed and developing country with many developing country limiting protection for biopharmaceutical product under their interpretation of flexibility allowed under the agreement thus certain type of patent such those on new us of compound or new form of molecule are not available in many developing country further many developing country and some developed country do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in trip certain of our elanco animal health product are covered by patent or other form of intellectual property protection historically upon loss of effective market exclusivity for our animal health product we have not generally experienced the rapid and severe decline in revenue that are common in the human pharmaceutical segment our intellectual property portfoliowe consider intellectual property protection for certain product process us and formulation particularly with respect to those product discussed below to be important to our operation for many of our product in addition to the compound patent we hold other patent on manufacturing process formulation or us that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the compound patent the most relevant patent protection or data protection for our top selling or recently launched patent protected marketed product is follows alimta is protected by vitamin regimen patent plus pediatric exclusivity cyramza is protected by compound patent and biologics data package protection emgality is protected by compound patent forteo is protected by use patent august jardiance and the related combination product glyxambi and synjardy are protected by compound patent not including possible patent extension lartruvo is protected by compound patent not including possible patent extension and by biologics data package protection following negative result in recent clinical trial we are suspending promotion of lartruvo and are working with global regulator to determine the appropriate next step olumiant is protected by compound patent not including possible patent extension portrazza is protected by compound patent not including possible patent extension and by biologics data package protection taltz is protected by compound patent not including possible patent extension and by biologic data package protection trajenta and jentadueto are protected by compound patent not including possible patent extension trulicity is protected by compound patent not including possible patent extension and by biologics data package protection verzenio is protected by compound patent not including possible patent extension outside the important patent protection or data protection includes alimta in major european country vitamin regimen patent and japan patent covering use to treat cancer concomitantly with vitamin cymbalta in japan data package protection january forteo in japan patent covering it formulation and it use august lartruvo in major european country compound patent and data package protection not including possible patent extension following negative result in recent clinical trial we are suspending promotion of lartruvo and are working with global regulator to determine the appropriate next step olumiant in major european country compound patent not including possible patent extension and japan compound patent taltz in major european country data package protection compound patent nasal glucagon ha been submitted for regulatory review in the and

protection year expected upon approval lasmiditan ha been submitted for regulatory review in the and is protected by compound patent not including possible patent extension worldwide we sell all of our major product under trademark for name and unique product appearance which we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operation trademark protection varies throughout the world with protection continuing in some country long the mark is used and in other country long it is registered registration are normally for fixed but renewable term trademark protection often extends beyond the patent and data protection for product patent licensesmost of our major product are not subject to significant license agreement for information on our license and collaboration agreement with incyte corporation related to olumiant see item financial statement and supplementary data note collaboration patent challenge in the the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of commonly known the hatch waxman act authorizes the fda to approve generic version of innovative human pharmaceutical other than biologics without completion of safety and efficacy study complete new drug application nda by filing an abbreviated new drug application anda in an anda the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only bioequivalence between the generic version and the nda approved drug not safety and efficacy establishing bioequivalence is generally straightforward and inexpensive for the generic company absent patent challenge the fda can not approve an anda until after certain of the innovator patent expire however after the innovator ha marketed it product for four year generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more of the patent listed in the innovator nda are invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known paragraph iv certification the innovator must file suit the generic manufacturer to protect it patent the fda is then prohibited from approving the generic company application for month period which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge if one or more of the nda listed patent are challenged the first filer of paragraph iv certification may be entitled to day period of market exclusivity all other generic manufacturer generic manufacturer use paragraph iv certification extensively to challenge patent on innovative human pharmaceutical in addition generic company have shown willingness to launch at risk after receiving anda approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge we are currently in litigation with numerous generic manufacturer in hatch waxman litigation involving alimta among other product for more information on hatch waxman litigation involving the company see item financial statement and supplementary data note contingency and item legal proceeding under the bpci act the fda can not approve biosimilar application until data protection expires year after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic however the bpci act provide mechanism for competitor to challenge the validity of an innovator patent early four year after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic the patent litigation scheme under the bpci act is complex and interpretation of the bpci act is currently the subject of ongoing litigation specifically court have held that biosimilar applicant are not required to engage in the bpci act litigation scheme patent holder still have the right to bring suit under normal patent law procedure if biosimilar applicant attempt to commercialize product prior to patent expiration addition there is procedure in patent law known inter partes review ipr which allows any member of the public to file petition with the uspto seeking the review of any issued patent iprs are conducted before administrative patent judge in the uspto using lower standard of proof than used in federal district court in addition the challenged patent are not accorded the presumption of validity are in federal district court we are now seeing instance where generic drug company and some investment firm are attempting to invalidate our patent by filing ipr challenge in the uspto for more information see item financial statement and supplementary data note contingency outside the the legal doctrine and process by which pharmaceutical patent can be challenged vary widely in recent year we have experienced an increase in patent challenge from generic manufacturer in many country outside the and we expect this trend to continue for more information on administrative challenge and litigation involving our alimta patent in europe and japan see item financial statement and supplementary data note contingency government regulation of our operationsour operation are regulated extensively by numerous national state and local agency the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for governmental approval is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introduction promotion marketing manufacturing and distribution of human pharmaceutical and animal health product are extensively regulated in all major market we conduct extensive post marketing surveillance of the safety of the product we sell in addition our operation are subject to complex federal state local and foreign law and regulation concerning the environment occupational health and safety and privacy animal health product regulation address the administration of the product in or on the animal and in the case of food animal product the impact on human who consume the food well the impact on the environment at the production site compliance with the law and regulation affecting the manufacture and sale of current product and the discovery development and introduction of new product will continue to require substantial effort expense and capital investment of particular importance to our business is the fda in the pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fda ha jurisdiction over all of our human pharmaceutical product and device and certain animal health product in the and administers requirement covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing quality control distribution labeling marketing advertising dissemination of information and post marketing surveillance of those product the fda extensively regulates all aspect of manufacturing quality for human pharmaceutical under it current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulation outside the our product and operation are subject to similar regulatory requirement notably by the european medicine agency in the eu and the ministry of health labor and welfare in japan specific regulatory requirement vary from country to country we make substantial investment of capital and operating expense to implement comprehensive company wide quality system in our manufacturing product development and process development operation in an effort to ensure sustained compliance with cgmp and similar regulation however in the event we fail to adhere to these requirement in the future we could be subject to interruption in production fine and penalty and delay in new product approval certain of our product are manufactured by third party and their failure to comply with these regulation could adversely affect through failure to supply product to or delay in new product approval the department of agriculture and the environmental protection agency also regulate some animal health product the marketing promotional and pricing practice of human pharmaceutical manufacturer well the manner in which manufacturer interact with purchaser prescribers and patient are subject to various other federal and state law including the federal anti kickback statute and the false claim act and state law governing kickback false claim unfair trade practice and consumer protection these law are administered by among others the department of justice doj the office of inspector general of the department of health and human service the federal trade commission the office of personnel management and state attorney general over the past several year state and federal government have increased their oversight enforcement activity and intra agency coordination with respect to pharmaceutical company several claim brought by these agency against and other company under these and other law have resulted in corporate criminal sanction and substantial civil settlement foreign corrupt practice act of fcpa prohibits certain individual and entity including publicly traded company from promising offering or giving anything of value to foreign official with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage the fcpa also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal control requirement on publicly traded company noted outside the our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign official additionally in many country outside the the health care provider who prescribe human pharmaceutical are employed by the government and the purchaser of human pharmaceutical are government entity therefore our interaction with these prescribers and purchaser are subject to regulation under the fcpa in addition to the application and enforcement of the fcpa the various jurisdiction in which we operate and supply our product have law and regulation aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior in recent year several jurisdiction including china brazil and the united kingdom have enhanced their law and regulation in this area increased their enforcement activity and or increased the level of cross border coordination and information sharing we are and could in the future become subject to administrative and legal proceeding and action which could include claim for civil penalty including treble damage under the false claim act criminal sanction and administrative remedy including exclusion from federal and other health care program it is possible that an adverse outcome in future action could have material adverse impact on our consolidated result of operation liquidity and financial position regulation and private payer action affecting human pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access in

price and reduce out of pocket cost blueprint the administration corresponding request for information included more than proposed policy change we believe the effect of certain of these proposal would be positive for our business while others would have negative consequence to our business the effect of these proposal and other proposal that extend beyond the blueprint will depend on the detail and timing of the final legislation regulation or guidance and could lead to wide range of outcome some of these outcome could have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation and cash flow at the state level in the california nevada and several other state have enacted legislation related to prescription drug pricing transparency it is unclear the effect this legislation will have on our business in most international market we operate in an environment of government mandated cost containment program which may include price control international reference pricing to other country price discount and rebate therapeutic reference pricing to other often generic pharmaceutical choice restriction on physician prescription level and mandatory generic substitution public and private payer are increasingly restricting access to human pharmaceutical based on assessment of comparative effectiveness and value including through the establishment of formal health technology assessment process in addition third party organization including professional association academic institution and non profit entity associated with payer are conducting and publishing comparative effectiveness and cost benefit analysis on medicine the impact of which are uncertain at this time we can not predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative regulatory or payer development however in general we expect that state federal and international legislative and regulatory development could have further negative effect on pricing and reimbursement for our human pharmaceutical product research and developmentour commitment to research and development date back more than year we invest heavily in research and development we believe it is critical to our long term competitiveness at the end of we employed approximately people in human pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activity including substantial number of physician scientist holding graduate or postgraduate degree and highly skilled technical personnel our internal human pharmaceutical research focus primarily on the area of oncology diabetes neurodegeneration immunology and pain we believe that we have strong biotechnology research program with more than half of our clinical stage pipeline currently consisting of biologics in addition to discovering and developing nmes we seek to expand the value of existing product through new us formulation and therapeutic approach that provide additional value to patient to supplement our internal effort we collaborate with others including academic institution and research based pharmaceutical and biotechnology company we use the service of physician hospital medical school and other research organization worldwide to conduct clinical trial to establish the safety and effectiveness of our human pharmaceutical product we actively invest in external research and technology that we believe complement and strengthen our own effort these investment can take many form including licensing arrangement co development and co marketing agreement co promotion arrangement joint venture and acquisition our elanco animal health innovation strategy is focused on identifying and developing promising technology and potential product from internal and external source to meet unmet veterinary food producer and pet owner need our animal health scientist also leverage discovery from our human health laboratory to develop product to enhance the health and well being of farm animal and pet human pharmaceutical development is time consuming expensive and risky on average only one out of many thousand of molecule discovered by researcher ultimately becomes an approved medicine the process from discovery to regulatory approval can take over decade drug candidate can fail at any stage of the process and even late stage drug candidate sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success the rate of innovation cycle leading to medical improvement over initial invention is accelerating which ha increased the risk that we opt not to develop late stage asset or that new product fail to achieve commercial success due to technical obsolescence displacement by follow on competitor product before the period of exclusivity ha ended after approval and launch of product we expend considerable resource on post marketing surveillance and additional clinical study to collect data and understand the benefit and potential risk of medicine they are used therapeutic the following describes in more detail the research and development process for human pharmaceutical product phase of new drug development discovery phasethe earliest phase of new drug research and development the discovery phase can take many year scientist identify design and synthesize promising molecule screening ten of thousand of molecule for their effect on biological target that appear to play an important role in one or more disease target can be part of the body such protein receptor or gene or foreign such virus or bacteria some target have been proven to affect disease process but often the target is unproven and may later prove to be irrelevant to the disease or to yield insufficient clinical benefit molecule that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criterion become candidate molecule and move to the next phase of development the probability of any one candidate molecule becoming commercial product is extremely low early development phasethe early development phase involves refining candidate molecule understanding to manufacture efficiently and completing initial testing for safety and efficacy safety testing is done first in laboratory test and animal necessary to identify toxicity and other potential safety issue that would preclude use in human in general the first human test often referred to phase are conducted in small group of healthy volunteer or patient to ass safety and find the potential dosing range after safe dose range ha been established the drug is typically administered to small population of patient phase ii to look for initial sign of efficacy in treating the targeted disease or biomarkers of the disease and to continue to ass safety in parallel scientist work to identify safe effective and economical manufacturing process long term animal study continue to test for potential safety issue of the molecule that enter the early development phase approximately percent move on to the product phase the early development phase can take several year to complete product phaseproduct phase phase iii molecule have met initial safety requirement and typically shown initial evidence of efficacy result these molecule generally have higher likelihood of success the molecule are tested in much larger patient population to demonstrate efficacy to predetermined level of statistical significance and to continue to develop the safety profile these trial are generally global in nature and are designed to generate the data necessary to submit the molecule to regulatory agency for marketing approval the potential new drug is generally compared with existing competitive therapy placebo or both the resulting data is compiled and may be submitted to regulatory agency around the world phase iii testing varies by disease state but can often last from three to four year submission phaseonce molecule is submitted to regulatory agency the time to final marketing approval can vary from several month to several year depending on variable such the disease state the strength and complexity of the data presented the novelty of the target or compound and the time required for the agency to evaluate the submission there is no guarantee that potential medicine will receive marketing approval or that decision on marketing approval or indication will be consistent across geographic area we believe our investment in research both internally and in collaboration with others have been rewarded by the large number of new molecule and new indication for existing molecule that we have in all stage of development we currently have approximately drug candidate across all stage of human testing and larger number of project in preclinical development among our new investigational molecule currently in the product phase of development or awaiting regulatory approval or launch are potential therapy for various cancer alzheimer disease pain migraine diabetes severe hypoglycemia and autoimmune disease including rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus psoriasis atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis we are studying many other drug candidate in the earlier stage of development in our chosen priority area we are also developing new us formulation or delivery method for many of these molecule well several currently marketed product see item management discussion and analysis result of operation executive overview late stage pipeline for more information on certain of our product candidate raw material and product supplymost of the principal material we use in our manufacturing operation are available from more than one source however we obtain certain raw or intermediate material primarily from only one source we generally seek to maintain sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of supply could be implemented in the event one of these supplier wa unable to provide the material or product however in the event of an extended failure of supplier it is possible that we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new source or in some case implemented alternative process the majority of our revenue come from product produced in our own facility our principal active ingredient manufacturing occurs at site we own in the ireland and puerto rico finishing operation including formulation filling assembling delivery device manufacturing and packaging take place at number of site throughout the world we utilize third party for certain active ingredient manufacturing and finishing operation manage our supply chain including our own facility contracted arrangement and inventory in way that is intended to allow to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to change in supply and demand to maintain stable supply of our product we use variety of technique including comprehensive quality system inventory management and back up site however human pharmaceutical and animal health production process are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditure process modification and regulatory approval accordingly if we were to experience extended plant shutdown at one of our own facility extended failure of contract supplier or extraordinary unplanned increase in demand we could experience an interruption in supply of certain product or product shortage until production could be resumed or expanded quality assuranceour success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our product and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from total commitment to quality in all part of our operation including research and development purchasing facility planning manufacturing distribution and dissemination of information about our medicine quality of production process involves strict control of ingredient equipment facility manufacturing method packaging material and labeling we perform test at various stage of production process and on the final product in an effort to assure that the product meet all

also adversely affect the company reputation pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain we may not succeed in developing or acquiring commercially successful product sufficient in number or value to replace revenue of product that have lost or will soon lose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing product or therapy there are many difficulty and uncertainty inherent in human pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new product there is high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development to bring drug from the discovery phase to market can take over decade and often cost in excess of billion failure can occur at any point in the process including in later stage after substantial investment result most fund invested in research program will not generate financial return new product candidate that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concern inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approval or payer reimbursement or coverage limited scope of approved us change in the relevant treatment standard or the availability of new or better competitive product difficulty or excessive cost to manufacture or infringement of the patent or intellectual property right of others regulatory agency continue to establish increasingly high hurdle for the efficacy and safety of new product delay and uncertainty in drug approval process can result in delay in product launch and lost market opportunity in addition it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rate of new product we can not state with certainty when or whether our product now under development will be approved or launched whether if initially granted such approval will be maintained whether we will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire additional product candidate or product or whether our product once launched will be commercially successful we must maintain continuous flow of successful new product and successful new indication or brand extension for existing product sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development cost and to replace revenue that are lost profitable product lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing product or therapy failure to do in the short term or long term would have material adverse effect on our business result of operation cash flow financial position and prospect see item management discussion and

well other expenditure required to bring new drug to the market property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time in the in addition to the process for challenging patent which applies to our biologic product the hatch waxman act provides generic company powerful incentive to seek to invalidate our other human pharmaceutical patent result we expect that our patent on major pharmaceutical product will continue to be routinely challenged in litigation and administrative proceeding and may not be upheld in addition separate ipr process allows competitor to request review of issued patent by the uspto without the protection of the hatch waxman act our patent may be invalidated via this review process although such decision can be appealed to the court in certain circumstance loss in such proceeding could result in competitor entering the market while win provides no precedential value the same patent can still be challenged by other competitor we face many generic manufacturer challenge to our patent outside the well the entry of generic competitor typically result in rapid and severe decline in revenue in addition competitor or other third party

that the treatment may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on clinically significant endpoint priority review is designed to expedite the review of potential medicine that if approved would be significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment diagnosis or prevention of serious condition when compared to standard application there are many difficulty and uncertainty inherent in human pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new product there is high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development to bring drug from the discovery phase to market can take over decade and often cost in excess of billion failure can occur at any point in the process including in later stage after substantial investment result most fund invested in research program will not generate financial return new product candidate that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concern inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approval or payer reimbursement or coverage limited scope of approved us change in the relevant treatment standard or the availability of new or better competitive product difficulty or excessive cost to manufacture or infringement of the patent or intellectual property right of others regulatory agency continue to establish increasingly high hurdle for the efficacy and safety of new product delay and uncertainty in drug approval process can result in delay in product launch and lost market opportunity in addition it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rate of new product we manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecule and delay in or termination of any one project will not necessarily cause significant change in our total research and development spending due to the risk and uncertainty involved in the research and development process we can not reliably estimate the nature timing and cost of the effort necessary to complete the development of our research and development project can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from successful research and development project each project represents only portion of the overall pipeline and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense while we do accumulate certain research and development cost on project level for internal reporting purpose we must make significant cost estimation and allocation some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanism therefore we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development cost by project by preclinical versus clinical spend or by therapeutic category matterselanco animal healthon september elanco animal health incorporated elanco subsidiary completed it ipo of million share of it common stock which represents percent of elanco outstanding share at per share in addition elanco completed debt offering and entered into term loan facility during the third quarter of see note and to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail we have announced our intent to divest our remaining share of elanco common stock through an exchange offer and on february elanco filed registration statement on form with the security and exchange commission sec in the exchange offer our shareholder can exchange all some or none of their share of our common stock for share of elanco common stock owned by subject to the specific term and condition of the offer described in elanco registration statement the completion of the exchange offer is subject to certain condition including at least share of elanco common stock being distributed in exchange for share of our common stock validly tendered in the exchange offer and the receipt of an opinion of counsel that the exchange offer will qualify for tax free treatment to and our participating shareholder however the condition of the exchange offer may not be satisfied we may exchange le than our entire interest in elanco or we may decide to waive one or more of these condition to the extent legally permissible and consummate the exchange offer even if all of the condition are not satisfied if the exchange offer is not fully subscribed we intend from time to time to complete subsequent exchange offer and or pro rata spin of our remaining interest in elanco lartruvoin january we announced that we are suspending promotion of lartruvo because the announce study did not meet the primary endpoint of overall survival we are working with global regulator to determine the appropriate next step we expect to incur charge in the first quarter of related to the suspension of promotion for lartruvo the exact amount of the charge ha not yet been determined but is estimated to be approximately million pre tax or approximately per share after tax revenue related to lartruvo wa million in patent matterswe depend on patent or other form of intellectual property protection for most of our revenue cash flow and earnings we lost patent exclusivity for the bipolar mania indication for zyprexa in japan in april generic version of zyprexa launched in japan in june the loss of exclusivity for zyprexa in japan ha caused rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product we lost our patent exclusivity for strattera in the in may and generic version of strattera were approved in the same month following settlement related to the compound patent challenge for effient generic product launched in the in the third quarter of the entry of generic competition for these product ha caused rapid and severe decline in revenue which in the aggregate ha had material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation and cash flow our compound patent protection for cialis tadalafil and adcirca tadalafil expired in major european market and the in november however in the we were granted pediatric exclusivity through may pursuant to settlement agreement related to our unit dose patent in the generic tadalafil entered the market in september we expect that the entry of additional generic competition into these market following the loss of exclusivity will continue to cause rapid and severe decline in revenue which will in the aggregate have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation and cash flow our formulation patent for forteo expired in december and use patent will expire in august in major european market and the both the formulation patent and the use patent expire in in japan while it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of generic and or biosimilar competition in these market we expect rapid and severe decline in revenue in the result of generic competition when the patent expire outside the we expect decline in revenue following patent expiration however the decline may not be rapid and severe in the aggregate we expect that the decline in revenue will have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation and cash flow alimta vitamin regimen patent which provide with patent protection for alimta through june in japan and major european country and through may in the have been challenged in each of these jurisdiction our vitamin regimen patent have also been challenged in other smaller european jurisdiction our compound patent for alimta expired in the in january and expired in major european country and japan in december we expect that the entry of generic competition for alimta following the loss of effective patent protection will cause rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product which will in the aggregate have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation and cash flow see note to the consolidated financial statement for more detailed account of the legal proceeding currently pending in the europe and japan regarding our alimta patent the compound patent for humalog insulin lispro ha expired in major market global regulator have different legal pathway to approve similar version of insulin lispro similar version of insulin lispro launched in the in the second quarter of and in certain european market in while it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of similar insulin lispro product entering the market we do not expect and have not experienced rapid and severe decline in revenue however we expect additional pricing pressure and some loss of market share that would continue over time foreign currency exchange ratesas global company with substantial operation outside the we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rate primarily the dollar against the euro and japanese yen while we manage portion of these exposure through hedging and other risk management technique significant fluctuation in currency rate can have substantial impact either positive or negative on our revenue cost of sale and operating expense while there is uncertainty in the future movement in foreign exchange rate fluctuation in these rate could negatively impact our future consolidated result of operation and cash flow the impact of the venezuelan financial crisis including the significant deterioration of the bolívar resulted in charge of million in see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information related to the charge of december our venezuelan subsidiary represented de minimis portion of our consolidated asset and liability we continue to monitor other deteriorating economy and it is possible that additional charge may be recorded in the future any additional charge are not expected to have material adverse effect on our future consolidated result of operation affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and accessunited statesin the public concern over access to and affordability of pharmaceutical continues to drive the regulatory and legislative debate these policy and political issue increase the risk that tax fee rebate or other cost control measure may be enacted to manage federal and state budget key health policy proposal affecting biopharmaceuticals include reduction in biologic data exclusivity modification to medicare part and language that would allow the department of health and human service to negotiate price for biologics and drug in medicare proposal that would require biopharmaceutical manufacturer to disclose proprietary drug pricing information and state level proposal related to prescription drug price and reducing the cost of pharmaceutical purchased by government health care program california and several other state have enacted legislation related to prescription drug pricing transparency and it is unclear the effect this legislation will have on our business the bipartisan budget act enacted in february requires manufacturer of brand name drug biologics and biosimilars to pay percent discount in the medicare part coverage gap up from the previous percent discount this increase in coverage gap discount became effective at the beginning of we expect this increase in the coverage gap discount to negatively impact our result of operation by approximately million in in may the white house released american patient first the trump administration blueprint to lower drug price and reduce out of pocket cost blueprint the administration corresponding request for information included more than proposed policy change we believe the effect of certain of these proposal would be positive for our business while others would have negative consequence to our business the effect of these proposal and those that extend beyond the blueprint will depend on the detail and timing of the final legislation regulation or guidance and could lead to wide range of outcome some of these outcome could have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation and cash flow in january the department of health and human service released proposed rule to reform the system of rebate paid to medicare part plan medicaid managed care organization and pharmacy benefit manager we are currently reviewing the proposed rule the impact of which is uncertain at this time in the private sector consolidation and integration among healthcare provider is also major factor in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceutical health plan pharmacy benefit manager wholesaler and other supply chain stakeholder have been consolidating into fewer larger entity increasingly through vertical integration thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance payer typically maintain formulary which specify coverage the condition under which drug are included on plan formulary and reimbursement the associated out of pocket cost to the consumer formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restriction such prior authorization and formulary exclusion or due to reimbursement limitation that result in higher consumer out of pocket cost such non preferred co pay tier increased co insurance level and higher deductible consequently pharmaceutical company compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attribute such greater efficacy fewer side effect or greater patient ease of use but also by providing rebate value based agreement are another tool which may be utilized between payer and pharmaceutical company formulary placement and pricing are negotiated price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decision particularly in treatment area in which the payer ha taken the position that multiple branded product are therapeutically comparable these downward pricing pressure could continue to negatively affect future consolidated result of operation and cash flow the main coverage expansion provision of the affordable care act aca are currently in effect through both state based exchange and the expansion of medicaid trend ha been the prevalence of benefit design containing high out of pocket cost for patient particularly for pharmaceutical in addition to the coverage expansion many employer in the commercial market driven in part by aca change such the implementation of the excise tax on employer sponsored health care coverage for which there is an excess benefit the so called cadillac tax continue to evaluate strategy such private exchange and wider use of consumer driven health plan to reduce their healthcare liability over time federal legislation litigation or administrative action to repeal or modify some or all of the provision of the aca could have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation and cash flow at the same time the broader paradigm shift towards performance based reimbursement and the launch of several value based purchasing initiative have placed demand on the pharmaceutical industry to offer product with proven real world outcome data and favorable economic profile operation also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulation cost containment measure exist in number of country including additional price control and mechanism to limit reimbursement for our product such policy are expected to increase in impact and reach given the pressure on national and regional health care budget that come from growing aging population and ongoing economic challenge additional reform are finalized we will ass their impact on future revenue in addition government in many emerging market are becoming increasingly active in expanding health care system offering given the budget challenge of increasing health care coverage for citizen policy may be proposed that promote generic and biosimilars only and reduce current and future access to branded human pharmaceutical product tax matterswe are subject to income tax in the and numerous foreign jurisdiction change in the relevant tax law regulation administrative practice and interpretation could adversely affect our future effective tax rate the recently enacted tax reform legislation including the tax act significantly revising tax law and other country are actively considering or enacting tax law change further organization such the organisation for economic co operation and development and the european commission are active regarding tax related matter which could influence international tax policy in country in which we operate while outcome of these initiative continue to develop and remain uncertain modification to key element of the or international tax framework could have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation and cash flow our accounting for the effect of the tax act signed into law in december is complete see note to the consolidated financial statement for further information related to the tax act however we expect that additional guidance will be issued in which may materially affect our assumption and estimate used to record our federal and state income tax expense resulting from the tax act refer to result of operation financial condition for discussion of the impact of the tax act on our liquidity acquisitionswe strategically invest in external research and technology that we believe to complement and strengthen our own effort these investment can take many form including licensing arrangement

december refer to the consolidated statement of cash flow for additional detail on the significant source and us of cash for the year ended december and december in addition to our cash and cash equivalent we held total investment of billion and billion of december and december respectively see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail of december total debt wa billion decrease of million compared with billion at december the decrease wa primarily due to the net decrease in the balance of commercial paper outstanding of billion and the repayment of billion of long term debt partially offset by the debt incurred by elanco result of note offering and entry into credit facility totaling billion see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail excluding elanco at december we had total of billion of unused committed bank credit facility billion of which is available to support our commercial paper program see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail in january we entered into billion credit facility to support our commercial paper program we believe that amount accessible through existing commercial paper market should be adequate to fund short term borrowing need in september elanco entered into revolving credit agreement providing for five year million senior unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in september see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail for the consecutive year we distributed dividend to our shareholder dividend of per

an indicated annual rate for of per share capital expenditure of billion during were million more than in in we repurchased billion of share we completed the billion share repurchase program announced

additional detail in january we initiated billion of share repurchase that will conclude in the first half of these purchase are part of the billion program previously authorized by the board we have separately announced our intent to divest our remaining interest in elanco through an exchange offer in the exchange offer our shareholder can exchange all some or none of their share of our common stock at discount for share of elanco common stock owned by subject to the term and condition of the offer described in elanco registration statement filed with the sec on february in february we completed our acquisition of loxo for per share or approximately billion which will be funded through mixture of cash and debt see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information see result of operation executive overview other matter patent matter for information regarding recent and upcoming loss of patent protection pursuant to the tax act the transitioned to territorial tax system effective january therefore repatriation of cash from our foreign subsidiary to the provides with additional liquidity in the without the requirement to pay tax existed prior to the enactment of the new tax law we believe cash provided by operating activity along with available cash and cash equivalent should be sufficient to fund our normal operating need including installment payment of the toll tax dividend paid to shareholder share repurchase and capital expenditure both domestically and abroad we continue to monitor the potential impact of the economic environment the creditworthiness of our wholesaler and other customer including foreign government backed agency and supplier the uncertain impact of health care legislation and various international government funding level in the normal course of business our operation are exposed to fluctuation in interest rate and currency value these fluctuation can vary the cost of financing investing and operating we seek to address of these risk through controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instrument the objective of controlling these risk is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuation in interest and currency exchange rate all derivative activity are for purpose other than trading our primary interest rate risk exposure result from change in short term dollar interest rate in an effort to manage interest rate exposure we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt position and may enter into interest rate derivative to help maintain that balance based on our overall interest rate exposure at december and including derivative and other interest rate risk sensitive instrument hypothetical percent change in interest rate applied to the fair value of the instrument of december and respectively would not have material impact on earnings cash flow or fair value of interest rate risk sensitive instrument over one year period our foreign currency risk exposure result from fluctuating currency exchange rate primarily the dollar against the euro and japanese yen we face foreign currency exchange exposure when we enter into transaction arising from subsidiary trade and loan payable and receivables denominated in foreign currency we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the result of our global operation to the dollar at exchange rate that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period we may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contract to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rate principally the euro and the japanese yen our corporate risk management policy outline the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposure gain and loss on these derivative contract offset in part the impact of currency fluctuation on the existing asset and liability we periodically analyze the fair value of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contract to determine their sensitivity to change in foreign exchange rate hypothetical percent change in exchange rate primarily against the dollar applied to the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contract of december and would not have material impact on earnings cash flow or financial position over one year period this sensitivity analysis doe not consider the impact that hypothetical change in exchange rate would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transaction off balance sheet arrangement and contractual obligationswe have no off balance sheet arrangement that have material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have material future effect on our financial condition change in financial condition revenue or expense result of operation liquidity capital expenditure or capital resource we acquire and collaborate on potential product still in development and enter into research and development arrangement with third party that often require milestone and royalty payment to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future event linked to the success of the asset in development milestone payment may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sale level if required by the arrangement we may make royalty payment based upon percentage of the sale of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained because of the contingent nature of these payment they are not included in the table of contractual obligation below individually these arrangement are generally not material in any one annual reporting period however if milestone for multiple product covered by these arrangement were reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense or aggregate milestone payment made could be material to the result of operation or cash flow respectively in that period see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail these arrangement often give the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product which would allow to avoid making the contingent payment however we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objective we also note that from business perspective we view these payment positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flow from sale of product current noncancelable contractual obligation that will require future cash payment are follows payment due by period dollar in million total le year more yearslong term debt including interest payment lease operating obligation tax act one time toll tax long term liability reflected on our balance sheet our long term debt obligation include both our expected principal and interest obligation and our interest rate swap we used the interest rate forward curve at december to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instrument and swap we have included the following purchase obligation consisting primarily of all open purchase order of december some of these purchase order may be cancelable however for purpose of this disclosure we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligation contractual payment obligation with each of our significant vendor which are noncancelable and are not contingent the tax act provided an election to taxpayer subject to the toll tax to make payment over an eight year period we made this election therefore we have included future toll tax payment accordingly we have included long term liability consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirement and other post employment benefit liability we excluded long term income tax payable of billion because we can not reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflow associated with those liability the contractual obligation table is current of december we expect the amount of these obligation to change materially over time new contract are initiated and existing contract are completed terminated or modified application of critical accounting estimatesin preparing our financial statement in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the gaap we must often make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue expense and related disclosure some of those judgment can be subjective and complex and consequently actual result could differ from those estimate for any given individual estimate or assumption we make it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same fact and circumstance could develop different estimate we believe that given current fact and circumstance it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation financial position or liquidity for the period presented in this report our most critical accounting estimate have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below revenue recognition and sale return rebate and discount accrualswe recognize revenue primarily from two different type of contract product sale to customer net product revenue and collaboration and other arrangement revenue recognized from collaboration and other arrangement will include our share of profit from the collaboration well royalty upfront and milestone payment we receive under these type of contract refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for further information on revenue recognition and sale return rebate and discount accrual financial statement impactwe believe that our accrual for sale return rebate and discount are reasonable and appropriate based on current fact and circumstance our global rebate and discount liability are included in sale rebate and discount on our consolidated balance sheet our global sale return liability is included in other current liability and other noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet of december percent change in our global sale return rebate and discount liability would have led to an approximate million effect on our income before income tax portion of our global sale return rebate and discount liability resulting from sale of our product in the wa approximately percent of december and december the following represents roll forward of our most significant pharmaceutical sale return rebate and discount liability balance including managed care medicare and medicaid dollar in million return rebate and discount liability beginning of year of net sale due to sale return discount and rebate payment of discount and rebate sale return rebate and discount liability end of year adjustment of the estimate for these return rebate and discount to actual result were approximately percent of consolidated net sale for each of the year presented product litigation liability and other contingenciesbackground and uncertaintiesproduct litigation liability and other contingency are by their nature uncertain and based upon complex judgment and probability the factor we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserve and other contingent liability amount include the merit and jurisdiction of the litigation the nature and the number of other similar current and past matter the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussion if any in addition we accrue for certain product liability claim incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate reasonable estimate of their cost based primarily on historical claim experience and data regarding product usage we accrue legal defense cost expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingency when both probable and reasonably estimable we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for period covered by insurance in assessing our insurance coverage we consider the policy coverage limit and exclusion the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company the financial condition of the insurer and the possibility of and length of time for collection due to very restrictive market for product liability insurance we are self insured for product liability loss for all our currently marketed product in addition to insurance coverage we also consider any third party indemnification to which we are entitled or under which we are obligated with respect to our third party indemnification right these consideration include the nature of the indemnification the financial condition of the indemnifying party and the possibility of and length of time for collection the litigation accrual and environmental liability and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on gross basis liability and asset respectively on our consolidated balance sheet impairment of indefinite lived and long lived assetsbackground and uncertaintieswe review the carrying value of long lived asset both intangible and tangible for potential impairment on periodic basis and whenever event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable we identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flow to be generated by the asset or asset group to it carrying value if an impairment is identified loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset net book value over it fair value and the cost basis is adjusted goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicator are present when required comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of asset is performed to determine the amount of any impairment several method may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired ipr all of which require multiple assumption we utilize the income method described in note to the consolidated financial statement for acquired ipr asset the risk of failure ha been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these asset ultimately will yield successful product discussed previously in result of operation executive overview late stage pipeline the nature of the pharmaceutical business is high risk and requires that we invest in large number of project to maintain successful portfolio of approved product such it is likely that some acquired ipr asset will become impaired in the future of future cash flow based on we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumption and projection require management judgment actual result could vary materially from these estimate retirement benefit assumptionsbackground and uncertaintiesdefined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan cost include assumption for the discount rate expected return on plan asset and retirement age these assumption have significant effect on the amount reported in addition to the analysis below see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information regarding our retirement benefit annually we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan asset in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plan we use an actuarially determined plan specific yield curve of high quality fixed income debt instrument to determine the discount rate in evaluating the expected return on plan asset we consider many factor with primary analysis of current and projected market condition asset return and asset allocation approximately percent of which are growth investment and the view of leading financial adviser and economist we may also review our historical assumption compared with actual result well the discount rate and expected return on plan asset of other company where applicable in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption we consider the retirement age of our past employee eligible for pension and medical benefit together with our expectation of future retirement age financial statement impactif the discount rate for the defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plan plan were to change by quarter percentage point income before income tax would change by million if the expected return on plan asset for plan were to change by quarter percentage point income before income tax would change by million if our assumption regarding the expected age of future retiree for plan were adjusted by one year our income before income tax would be affected by million the plan including puerto rico represent approximately percent and percent of the total projected benefit obligation and total plan asset respectively at december income taxesbackground and uncertaintieswe prepare and file tax return based upon our interpretation of tax law and regulation and record estimate based on these judgment and interpretation in the normal course of business our tax return are subject to examination by various taxing authority which may result in future tax interest and penalty assessment by these authority inherent uncertainty exist in estimate of many tax position due to change in tax law resulting from legislation and regulation concluded through the various jurisdiction tax court system we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement from such position are measured based on the largest benefit that ha greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution the amount of unrecognized tax benefit is adjusted for change in fact and circumstance for example adjustment could result from significant amendment to existing tax law the issuance of regulation or interpretation by the taxing authority new information obtained during tax examination or resolution of tax examination we believe our estimate for uncertain tax position are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessment that may result from examination of our tax return we recognize both accrued interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit in income tax expense we have recorded valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax asset primarily those that have been generated from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdiction in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax asset we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategy in the jurisdiction associated with these carryforwards where history doe not support such an assumption implementation of tax planning strategy to recover these deferred tax asset or future income generation in these jurisdiction could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowance and reduction of income tax expense the tax act wa enacted in december and introduced significant change to the corporate income tax system in accordance with gaap our accounting for the effect of the tax act is complete refer to result of operation executive overview other matter tax matter and note to the consolidated financial statement for further discussion on the tax act subsequent to the enactment of the tax act numerous item of additional guidance were issued including notice proposed regulation and final regulation we expect that further guidance will be issued in which may change our interpretation of the new tax law and could materially affect the estimate used to record federal and state income tax expense financial statement impactas of december percent change in the amount of uncertain tax position and the valuation allowance would result in change in net income of million and million respectively acquisitionsbackground and uncertaintiesto determine whether acquisition or licensing transaction should be accounted for business combination or an asset acquisition we make certain judgment which include assessing whether the acquired set of activity and asset would meet the definition of business under the relevant accounting rule if the acquired set of activity and asset meet the definition of business asset acquired and liability assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair value of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net asset where applicable is recorded goodwill if the acquired set of activity and asset doe not meet the definition of business the transaction is recorded an acquisition of asset and therefore any acquired ipr that doe not have an alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date and goodwill is not recorded refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information the judgment made in determining estimated fair value assigned to asset acquired and liability assumed in business combination well estimated asset life can materially affect our consolidated result of operation the fair value of intangible asset including acquired ipr are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on expectation and assumption that are deemed reasonable by management depending on the fact and circumstance we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant asset and liability the fair value of identifiable intangible asset are primarily determined using an income method described in note to the consolidated financial statement the fair value of any contingent consideration liability that result from business combination is determined using market approach based on quoted market value significant other observable input for identical or comparable asset or liability or discounted cash flow analysis estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of significant estimate and judgment including but not limited to revenue and the discount rate financial statement impactas of december percent change in the contingent consideration liability would result in change in income before income tax of million legal and regulatory matter information relating to certain legal proceeding can be found in note to the consolidated financial statement and is incorporated here by reference expectation for for the full year of we expect eps to be in the range of to reflecting the anticipated impact of the loxo acquisition and the suspension of promotion of

account of all wholly owned and majority owned subsidiary are included in the consolidated financial statement where our ownership of consolidated subsidiary is le than percent the noncontrolling shareholder interest are reflected separate component of equity all intercompany balance and transaction have been eliminated the preparation of financial statement in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue expense and related disclosure at the date of the financial statement and during the reporting

additional information certain reclassification have been made to prior period in the consolidated financial statement and accompanying note to conform with the current presentation all per share amount unless otherwise noted in the footnote are presented on diluted basis adoption of revenue accounting standardeffective january we adopted accounting standard update revenue from contract with customer and other related update see note for additional discussion the new standard ha been applied to contract for which performance wa not substantially complete of the date of adoption for those contract that were modified prior to the date of adoption we reflected the aggregate effect of those modification when determining the appropriate accounting under the new standard we believe the effect of applying this practical expedient resulted in material difference revenue presented for period prior to wa accounted for under previous standard and ha not been adjusted revenue and net income for do not differ materially from amount that would have resulted from application of the previous standard the following table summarizes our revenue recognized in our consolidated statement of operation product revenue and other revenue collaboration and other revenue associated with prior year transfer of intellectual property wa million million and million during the year ended and respectively we recognize revenue primarily from two different type of contract product sale to customer net product revenue and collaboration and other arrangement revenue recognized from collaboration and other arrangement will include our share of profit from the collaboration well royalty upfront and milestone payment we receive under these type of contract see note for additional information related to our collaboration and other arrangement collaboration and other revenue disclosed above includes the revenue from the trajenta and jardiance family of product resulting from our collaboration with boehringer ingelheim discussed in note substantially all of the remainder of collaboration and other revenue is related to contract accounted for contract with customer product revenuerevenue from sale of product is recognized at the point where the customer obtains control of the good and we satisfy our performance obligation which generally is at the time we ship the product to the customer payment term differ by jurisdiction and customer but payment term in most of our major jurisdiction typically range from to day from date of shipment revenue for our product sale ha not been adjusted for the effect of financing component we expect at contract inception that the period between when we transfer control of the product and when we receive payment will be one year or le any exception are either not material or we collect interest for payment made after the due date provision for rebate and discount and return are established in the same period the related sale are recognized we generally ship product shortly after order are received therefore we generally only have day of order received but not yet shipped at the end of any reporting period shipping and handling activity are considered to be fulfillment activity and are not considered to be separate performance obligation we exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all tax assessed by governmental authority that are imposed on our sale of product and collected from customer significant judgment must be made in determining the transaction price for our sale of product related to anticipated rebate and discount and return the following describe the most significant of these judgment sale rebate and discount background and uncertainty most of our pharmaceutical product are sold to wholesaler that serve pharmacy physician and other health care professional and hospital most of our animal health product are sold to wholesale distributor we initially invoice our customer at contractual list price contract with direct and indirect customer may provide for various rebate and discount that may differ in each contract consequence to determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sale at the time we recognize sale to direct customer we must estimate any rebate or discount that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customer in the distribution chain under the term of our contract significant judgment are required in making these estimate the rebate and discount amount are recorded deduction to arrive at our net product revenue sale rebate and discount that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include managed care medicare medicaid chargebacks long term care hospital patient assistance program and various other program we estimate these accrual using an expected value approach the largest of our sale rebate and discount amount are rebate associated with sale covered by managed care medicare medicaid and chargeback contract in the united state in determining the appropriate accrual amount we consider our historical rebate payment for these program by product percentage of our historical sale well any significant change in sale trend patent expiry and product launch an evaluation of the current contract for these program the percentage of our product that are sold via these program and our product pricing although we accrue liability for rebate related to these program at the time we record the sale the rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six month later because of this time lag in any particular period our rebate adjustment may incorporate revision of accrual for several period most of our rebate outside the are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period the related sale in some large european country government rebate are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payment in the country an estimate of these rebate updated governmental authority revise budgeted deficit is recognized in the same period the related sale sale return background and uncertainty when product sale occur to determine the appropriate transaction price for our sale we estimate reserve for future product return related to those sale using an expected value approach this estimate is based on several factor including historical return rate expiration date by product on average approximately month after the initial sale of product to our customer and estimated level of inventory in the wholesale and retail channel well any other specifically identified anticipated return due to known factor such the loss of patent exclusivity product recall and discontinuance or changing competitive environment we maintain return policy that allows pharmaceutical customer to return product for dating issue within specified period prior to subsequent to the product expiration date following the loss of exclusivity for patent dependent product we expect to experience an elevated level of product return product inventory remaining in the wholesale and retail channel expires adjustment to the return reserve have been and may in the future be required based on revised estimate to our assumption we record the return amount deduction to arrive at our net product revenue once the product is returned it is destroyed we do not record right of return asset our return policy outside the are generally more restrictive than in the return are not allowed for reason other than failure to meet product specification in many country our reserve for future product return for product sale outside the is not material part of our process to estimate reserve for product return we regularly review the supply level of our significant product sold to major wholesaler in the and in major market outside the primarily by reviewing periodic inventory report supplied by our major wholesaler and available prescription volume information for our product or alternative approach we attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory level at an average of approximately one month or le on consistent basis across our product portfolio cause of unusual wholesaler buying pattern include actual or anticipated product supply issue weather pattern anticipated change in the transportation network redundant holiday stocking and change in wholesaler business operation in the the current structure of our arrangement provides with data on inventory level at our wholesaler however our data on inventory level in the retail channel is more limited wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically ha not caused any material change in the rate of actual product return actual product return have been le than percent of our net revenue over each of the past three year and have not fluctuated significantly percentage of revenue although fluctuation are more likely in period following loss of patent exclusivity for major product in the market adjustment to revenueadjustments to revenue recognized result of change in estimate for the judgment described above during for product shipped in previous year were approximately percent of revenue disaggregation of revenue our disaggregated revenue is disclosed in note collaboration and other arrangementswe recognize several type of revenue from our collaboration and other arrangement which we discus in general term immediately below and more specifically in note for each of our material collaboration and other arrangement our collaboration and other arrangement are not contract with customer but are evaluated to determine whether any aspect of the arrangement are contract with customer revenue related to product we sell pursuant to these arrangement is included in net product revenue while other source of revenue royalty and profit sharing from our partner are included in collaboration and other revenue initial fee and developmental milestone we receive in collaborative and other similar arrangement from the partnering of our compound under development are generally deferred and amortized into income through the expected product approval date profit sharing due from our collaboration partner which is based upon gross margin reported to by our partner is recognized collaboration and other revenue earned royalty revenue from licensee which is based on sale to third party of licensed product and technology is recorded when the third party sale occurs and the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty ha been allocated ha been satisfied or partially satisfied this royalty revenue is included in collaboration and other revenue for arrangement involving multiple good or service research and development marketing and selling manufacturing and distribution each required good or service is evaluated to determine whether it is distinct if good or service doe not qualify distinct it is combined with the other non distinct good or service within the arrangement and these combined good or service are treated single performance obligation for accounting purpose the arrangement transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price each performance obligation for arrangement that involve variable consideration where we have sold intellectual property we recognize revenue based on estimate of the amount of consideration we believe we will be entitled to receive from the other party subject to constraint these estimate are adjusted to reflect the actual amount to be collected when those fact and circumstance become known significant judgment must be made in determining the transaction price for our sale of intellectual property because of the risk that product in development will not receive regulatory approval we generally do not recognize any contingent payment that would be due to upon or after regulatory approval we have entered into arrangement whereby we transferred right to product and committed to supply for period of time for those arrangement for which we concluded that the obligation were not distinct any amount received upfront are being amortized to revenue net product revenue over the period of the supply arrangement the performance obligation is satisfied contract liabilitiesour contract liability result from arrangement where we have received payment in advance of performance under the contract and do not include sale rebate discount and return change in contract liability are generally due to either receipt of additional advance payment or our performance under the contract we have the following amount recorded for contract liability liability contract liability amount disclosed above of december and are primarily related to the remaining license period of symbolic intellectual property and obligation to supply product for defined period of time revenue recognized from contract liability of january during the year ended december wa not material revenue expected to be recognized in the future from contract liability the related performance obligation are satisfied is not expected to be material in any one year research and development expense and acquired in process research and developmentresearch and development expense include the following research and development cost which are expensed incurred milestone payment obligation incurred prior to regulatory approval of the product which are accrued when the event requiring payment of the milestone occurs acquired

entity can apply the new revenue standard retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application in retained earnings we applied the latter approach application of the new standard to applicable contract resulted in an increase of approximately million to retained earnings of january disclosure required by the new standard are included in note note and note accounting standard update financial instrument overall recognition and measurement of financial asset and financial liability this standard requires entity to recognize change in the fair value of equity investment with readily determinable fair value in net income except for investment accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee an entity should apply the new standard through cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption upon adoption we reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss the after tax amount of net unrealized gain resulting in an increase to retained earnings of approximately million adoption of this standard did not result in material change in net income in accounting standard update income tax intra entity transfer of asset other than inventory this standard requires entity to recognize the income tax consequence of intra entity transfer of asset other than inventory at the time of transfer this standard requires modifiedretrospective approach to adoption upon adoption the cumulative effect of applying the standard resulted in an increase of approximately million to retained earnings billion to deferred tax asset and billion to deferred tax liability adoption of this standard did not result in material change in net income in standard update compensation retirement benefit improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost this standard wa issued to improve the transparency and comparability among organization by requiring entity to separate their net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost into service cost component and other component previously the cost of the other component along with the service cost component were classified based upon the function of the employee this standard requires entity to classify the service cost component in the same financial statement line item or item other compensation cost arising from service rendered by pertinent employee the other component of net benefit cost are now presented separately from the line item that include the service cost component when applicable the service cost component is now the only component eligible for capitalization an entity should apply the new standard retrospectively for the classification of the service cost and other component and prospectively for the capitalization of the service cost component upon adoption of this standard pension and postretirement benefit cost component other than service cost are presented in other net income expense the application of the new standard resulted in reclassification to other income of million for the year ended december while increasing cost of sale by million research and development expense by million and marketing selling and administrative expense by million for the same period the application of the new standard resulted in reclassification to other income of million for the year ended december while increasing cost of sale by million research and development expense by million and marketing selling and administrative expense by million for the same period we do not expect application of the new standard to have material impact on an ongoing basis we elected to early adopt accounting standard update income statement reporting comprehensive income reclassification of certain tax effect from accumulated other comprehensive income of december which allowed reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings for stranded tax effect resulting from the tax cut and job act tax act see note this standard allowed to reclassify the effect of remeasuring deferred tax liability and asset related to item within accumulated other comprehensive loss using the then newly enacted percent federal corporate income tax rate the provisional effect of this early adoption wa reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive loss which resulted in an increase to retained earnings of million of december the following table provides brief description of the accounting standard that had not yet been adopted of december standard description effective date effect

plan to use the latter approach this standard wa effective january and we adopted on that date we expect to record right of use asset and lease liability for operating lease of approximately million on our consolidated balance sheet of january our accounting for capital lease will remain substantially unchanged this standard will not have material impact on our consolidated statement of operation

consolidated statement of operation for equity security held of december wa million we periodically ass our investment in available for sale security for other than temporary impairment loss there were no other than temporary impairment loss recognized in or other than temporary impairment loss recognized during the year ended december totaled million other than temporary impairment loss recognized during related primarily to our cost and equity method investment we periodically ass our investment in equity security other than public equity security for impairment loss impairment loss recognized on these equity security in were immaterial for fixed income security the amount of credit loss are determined by comparing the difference between the present value of future cash flow expected to be collected on these security and the amortized cost factor considered in assessing credit loss include the position in the capital structure vintage and amount of collateral delinquency rate current credit support and geographic concentration for equity security factor considered in assessing impairment loss include the financial condition and near term prospect of the issuer and general market condition and industry specific factor of december the available for sale security in an unrealized loss position include primarily fixed rate debt security of varying maturity which are sensitive to change in the yield curve and other market condition approximately percent of the fixed rate debt security in loss position are investment grade debt security of december we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security in loss position before the market value recover or the underlying cash flow have been received and there is no indication of default on interest or principal payment for any of our debt security related to our investment portfolio substantially all of which related to equity and available for sale

based upon the impairment consideration mentioned above adjustment recorded during were not material account receivable factoring arrangementswe have entered into account receivable factoring agreement with financial institution to sell certain of our non account receivable these transaction are accounted for sale and result in reduction in account receivable because the agreement transfer effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyer our factoring agreement do not allow for recourse in the event of uncollectibility and we do not retain any interest in the underlying account receivable once sold we derecognized million and million of account receivable of december and respectively under these factoring arrangement the cost of factoring such account

the amortized cost of the right to asset acquired in business combination and approved for marketing in significant global jurisdiction europe and japan and capitalized milestone payment for transaction other than business combination we capitalize milestone payment incurred at or after the product ha obtained regulatory approval for marketing other finite lived intangible consist primarily of the amortized cost of licensed platform technology that have alternative future us in research and development manufacturing technology and customer relationship from business combination acquired ipr consists of the related cost capitalized adjusted for subsequent impairment if any the cost of acquired ipr project acquired directly in transaction other than business combination are capitalized if the project have an alternative future use otherwise they are expensed immediately the fair value of acquired ipr project acquired in business combination are capitalized other intangible asset method may be used to determine the estimated fair value of other intangible acquired in business combination we utilize the income method which is level fair value measurement and applies probability weighting that considers the risk of development and commercialization to the estimated future net cash flow that are derived from projected revenue and estimated cost these projection are based on factor such relevant market size patent protection historical pricing of similar product and expected industry trend the estimated future net cash flow are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate this analysis is performed for each asset independently the acquired ipr asset are treated indefinite lived intangible asset until completion or abandonment of the project at which time the asset are tested for impairment and amortized over the remaining useful life or written off appropriate see note for additional discussion of recent capitalized milestone payment other indefinite lived intangible asset are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when impairment indicator are present finite lived intangible asset are reviewed for impairment when an indicator of impairment is present when required comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of asset is performed to determine the amount of any impairment when determining the fair value of indefinite lived acquired ipr well the fair value of finite lived intangible asset for impairment testing purpose we utilize the income method discussed above during we had animal health intangible impairment charge of million comprised of million impairment of finite lived intangible asset and million impairment of indefinite lived intangible asset which were recorded in asset impairment restructuring and other special charge on the consolidated statement of operation these impairment were primarily related to the sale of the posilac rbst brand and competitive pressure for

and million impairment of indefinite lived intangible asset which were recorded in asset impairment restructuring and other special charge on the consolidated statement of operation these impairment were related to competitive pressure for certain companion animal product resulting in reduction of revenue well lower projected revenue for posilac rbst no material impairment occurred with respect to the carrying value of other intangible asset for the year ended december intangible asset with finite life are capitalized and are amortized over their estimated useful life ranging from three to year of december the remaining weighted average amortization period for finite lived intangible asset wa approximately year amortization expense related to finite lived intangible asset wa follows expense estimated amortization expense for each of the next five year associated with our finite lived intangible asset of december is follows amortization expense expense is included in either cost of sale marketing selling and administrative or research and development depending on the nature of the intangible asset being amortized property and equipmentproperty and equipment is stated on the basis of cost provision for depreciation of building and equipment are computed generally by the straight line method at rate based on their estimated useful life to year for building and three to year for equipment we review the carrying value of long lived asset for potential impairment on periodic basis and whenever event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable impairment is determined by comparing projected undiscounted cash flow to be generated by the asset to it carrying value if an impairment is identified loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset net book value over it fair value and the cost basis is adjusted at december property and equipment consisted of the following in accumulated depreciation property and equipment net expense related to property and equipment and rental expense for all lease including contingent rental not material wa follows expense future minimum rental commitment under non cancelable

december and and is shown reduction of shareholder equity any dividend transaction between and the trust are eliminated stock held by the trust is not considered outstanding in the computation of eps the asset of the trust were not used to fund any of our obligation under these employee benefit plan during the year ended december and income tax actin december the president of the signed into law the tax act the tax act included significant change to the corporate income tax system such the reduction in the corporate income tax rate from percent to percent transition to territorial tax system change to business related exclusion deduction and credit and modification to international tax provision including one time repatriation transition tax also known the toll tax on unremitted foreign earnings gaap requires that the income tax accounting effect from change in tax law or tax rate be recognized in continuing operation in the reporting period that includes the enactment date of the change these effect include among other thing re measuring deferred tax asset and liability evaluating deferred tax asset for valuation allowance and assessing the impact of the toll tax and certain other provision of the tax act our accounting for the tax effect of the enactment of the tax act wa not complete of december however in certain case we made reasonable estimate in other case we were not able to make reasonable estimate and continued to account for those item based on our existing accounting model under asc income tax and the provision of the tax law that were in effect immediately prior to enactment for the item for which we were able to determine reasonable estimate we recognized provisional amount of billion which wa included component of income tax expense from continuing operation our accounting for the effect of the tax act wa completed in the current period and we recorded million of income tax benefit in mainly attributable to measurement period adjustment to the toll tax and the global intangible low taxed income gilti provision the new minimum tax on the earnings of our foreign subsidiary related to gilti we elected to establish deferred tax in the amount of billion for the reversal of temporary item in future year subsequent to the enactment of the tax act additional guidance wa issued including notice proposed regulation and final regulation we expect that further guidance will continue to be issued in which may impact our interpretation of the tax act and could materially affect the estimate used deferred tax are recognized for the future tax effect of temporary difference between financial and income tax reporting based on enacted tax law and rate we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement from such position are measured based on the largest benefit that ha greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution following is the composition of income tax expense federal tax total current tax tax act total deferred tax benefit tax component of our deferred tax asset and liability of december are follows tax asset purchase of intangible asset and credit carryforwards and loss carryforwards and return comprehensive loss on hedging gross deferred tax allowance total deferred tax tax liability earnings of foreign subsidiary inventory property and

credit of million and state tax credit of million all of which are substantially reserved at december based on filed tax return we had net operating loss and other carryforwards for international and federal income tax purpose of million million will expire by million will expire between and and million of the carryforwards will never expire net operating loss and other carryforwards for international and federal income tax purpose are partially reserved deferred tax asset related to state net operating loss of million and other state carryforwards of million are fully reserved domestic and puerto rican company contributed approximately percent percent and percent for the year ended december and respectively to consolidated income before income tax we have subsidiary operating in puerto rico under tax incentive grant effective through the end of the tax act introduced international tax provision that fundamentally change the taxation of foreign earnings result substantially all of the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiary are considered to not be indefinitely reinvested for continued use in our foreign operation at december we have accrued an immaterial amount of foreign withholding tax and state income tax that would be owed upon future distribution of unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiary that are not indefinitely reinvested for the amount considered to be indefinitely reinvested it is not practicable to determine the amount of the related deferred income tax liability due to the complexity in the tax law and assumption we would have to make payment of income tax were follows payment of income tax tax act provided an election to taxpayer subject to the toll tax to make payment over an eight year period we made this election therefore we have included toll tax payment accordingly following is reconciliation of the income tax expense applying the federal statutory rate to income before income tax to reported

tax expense during we made cash payment of approximately million related to tax year after application of available tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks the examination of tax year began in and we believe it is reasonably possible that this examination could reach resolution within the next month for tax year and certain matter under examination for tax year for which the audit remains ongoing result we currently estimate that gross uncertain tax position may be reduced by approximately million within the next month additionally we anticipate up to million of cash payment will be due upon resolution recognize both accrued interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit in income tax expense we recognized income tax benefit expense related to interest and penalty follows tax benefit expense at december and our accrual for the payment of interest and penalty totaled million and million respectively note retirement benefitswe use measurement date of december to develop the

and were not material benefit plan investmentsour benefit plan investment policy are set with specific consideration of return and risk requirement in relationship to the respective liability and puerto rico plan represent approximately percent of our global investment given the long term nature of our liability these plan have the flexibility to manage an above average degree of risk in the asset portfolio at the investment policy level there are no specifically prohibited investment however within individual investment manager mandate restriction and limitation are contractually set to align with our investment objective ensure risk control and limit concentration we manage our portfolio to minimize concentration of risk by allocating fund within asset category in addition within

implement the local investment policy or manage particular portfolio risk derivative are principally used to increase or decrease exposure to particular public equity fixed income commodity or currency market more rapidly or le expensively than could be accomplished through the use of the cash market the plan utilize both exchange traded and over the counter instrument the maximum exposure to either market or counterparty credit loss is limited to the carrying value of the receivable and is managed within contractual limit we expect all of our counterparties to meet their obligation the gross value of these derivative receivables and payable are not material to the global asset portfolio and their value are reflected within the table below the defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plan allocation for the and puerto rico currently comprises approximately percent growth investment and percent fixed income investment the growth investment allocation encompasses and international public equity security hedge fund private equity like investment and real estate these portfolio allocation are intended to reduce overall risk by providing diversification while seeking moderate to high return over the long term public equity security are well diversified and invested in and international small to large company across various asset manager and style the remaining portion of the growth portfolio is invested in private alternative investment fixed income investment primarily consist of fixed income security in treasury and agency emerging market debt obligation corporate bond mortgage backed security commercial mortgage backed obligation and any related repurchase agreement hedge fund are privately owned institutional investment fund that generally have moderate liquidity hedge fund seek specified level of absolute return regardless of overall market condition and generally have low correlation to public equity and debt market hedge fund often invest substantially in financial market instrument stock bond commodity currency derivative etc using very broad range of trading activity to manage portfolio risk hedge fund strategy focus primarily on security selection and seek to be neutral with respect to market move common grouping of hedge fund strategy include relative value tactical and event driven relative value strategy include arbitrage when the same asset can simultaneously be bought and sold at different price achieving an immediate profit tactical strategy often take long and short position to reduce or eliminate overall market risk while seeking particular investment opportunity event strategy opportunity can evolve from specific company announcement such merger and acquisition and typically have little correlation to overall market directional movement our hedge fund investment are made through limited partnership interest primarily in fund of fund structure to ensure diversification across many strategy and many individual manager plan holding in hedge fund are valued based on net asset value navs calculated by each fund or general partner applicable and we have the ability to redeem these investment at nav private equity like investment fund typically have low liquidity and are made through long term partnership or joint venture that invest in pool of capital invested in primarily non publicly traded entity underlying investment include venture capital early stage investing buyout and special situation investing private equity management firm typically acquire and then reorganize private company to create increased long term value private equity like fund usually have limited life of approximately year and require minimum investment commitment from their limited partner our private investment are made both directly into fund and through fund of fund structure to ensure broad diversification of management style and asset across the portfolio plan holding in private equity like investment are valued using the value reported by the partnership adjusted for known cash flow and significant event through our reporting date value provided by the partnership are primarily based on analysis of and judgment about the underlying investment input to these valuation include underlying navs discounted cash flow valuation comparable market valuation and may also include adjustment for currency credit liquidity and other risk applicable the vast majority of these private partnership provide with annual audited financial statement including their compliance with fair valuation procedure consistent with applicable accounting standard real estate is composed of both public and private holding real estate investment in registered investment company that trade on an exchange are

benefit pension plan to satisfy minimum funding requirement for the year additional discretionary contribution are not expected to be significant note contingencieswe are party to various legal action and government investigation the most significant of these are described below it is not possible to determine the outcome of these matter and we can not reasonably estimate the maximum potential exposure or the range of possible loss in excess of amount accrued for any of these matter however we believe that except noted below with respect to the alimta patent litigation and administrative proceeding the resolution of all such matter will not have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to our consolidated result of operation in any one accounting period accrual environmental liability and the related estimated insurance recoverables are reflected on gross basis liability and asset respectively on our consolidated balance sheet with respect to the product liability claim currently asserted against we have accrued for our estimated exposure to the extent they are both probable and reasonably estimable based on the information available to we accrue for certain product liability claim incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate reasonable estimate of their cost we estimate these expense based primarily on historical claim experience and data regarding product usage legal defense cost expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability loss contingency are accrued when both probable and reasonably estimable alimta patent litigation and administrative proceedingsa number of generic manufacturer are seeking approval in the japan and number of country in europe to market generic form of alimta prior to the expiration of our vitamin regimen patent alleging that those patent are invalid not infringed or both we believe our alimta vitamin regimen patent are valid and enforceable against these generic manufacturer however it is not possible to determine the ultimate outcome of the proceeding and accordingly we can provide no assurance that we will prevail an unfavorable outcome could have material adverse impact on our future consolidated result of operation liquidity and financial position we expect that loss of exclusivity for alimta in one or more of the below jurisdiction would result in rapid and severe decline in future revenue for the product in the relevant market patent litigation and administrative proceedingsin the more than abbreviated new drug application andas seeking approval to market generic version of alimta prior to the expiration of our vitamin regimen patent expiring in plus pediatric exclusivity expiring in
