producing region around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standard for our many blend and single origin coffee the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility although most coffee trade in the commodity market high altitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by starbucks tends to trade on negotiated basis at premium of contentsabove the coffee commodity price both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase supply and price can be affected by multiple factor in the producing country including weather natural disaster crop disease general increase in farm input and cost of production inventory level and political and economic condition price is also impacted by trading activity in the arabica coffee future market including hedge fund and commodity index fund in addition green coffee price have been affected in the past and may be affected in the future by the action of certain organization and association that have historically attempted to influence price of green coffee through agreement establishing export quota or by restricting coffee supply we buy coffee using fixed price and price to be fixed purchase commitment depending on market condition to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee price to be fixed contract are purchase commitment whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated term are agreed upon but the date and therefore the price at which the base coffee commodity price component will be fixed ha not yet been established for these type of contract either starbucks or the seller ha the option to select date on which to fix the base coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date price are fixed we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitment total green coffee purchase commitment of september were million comprised of million under fixed price contract and an estimated million under price to be fixed contract of september approximately million of our price to be fixed contract were effectively fixed through the use of future contract all price to be fixed contract of september were at the company option to

relationship with coffee producer outside trading company and exporter for our supply of green coffee we believe based on relationship established with our supplier the risk of non delivery on such

operating income and earnings per share the degree to which we enter into maintain develop and are able to negotiate appropriate term and condition and enforce commercial and other agreement the impact on our business especially in our larger or fast growing market due to labor discord war terrorism including incident targeting political instability boycott social unrest and natural disaster including health pandemic that lead to avoidance of public place or restriction on public gathering such in our store or cause material disruption in our supply chain and deterioration in our credit rating which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing economic condition in the and certain international market could adversely affect our

assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiative in accordance with our expectation which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial result these strategic initiative are designed to improve our result of operation and drive long term shareholder value and include successfully leveraging starbucks brand portfolio outside the company operated store base including our increased focus on international licensed store focusing on relevant product innovation and profitable new growth platform continuing to accelerate the growth of our channel development business balancing disciplined global store growth and existing store renovation meeting target store level unit economics in given market timely completing certain supply chain capacity expansion initiative including increased roasting capacity and construction of new soluble product plant and new evolution freshtm plant and executing multi channel advertising and marketing campaign to effectively communicate our message directly to starbucks consumer and employee of content we face intense competition in each of our channel and market which could lead to reduced profitability the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive including with respect to product quality service convenience and price and we face significant competition in each of our channel and market accordingly we do not have leadership position in all channel and market in the the ongoing focus by large competitor in the quick service restaurant sector on selling high quality specialty coffee beverage could adversely affect our sale and result of operation similarly continued competition from well established competitor in our international market could hinder growth and adversely affect our sale and result of operation in those market increased competition in the packaged coffee and tea and single serve and ready to drink coffee beverage market including from new and large entrant to this market could adversely affect the profitability of the channel development segment we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our america operating segment our financial performance is highly dependent on our america operating segment it comprised approximately of consolidated total net revenue in fiscal if revenue trend slow or decline our business and financial result could be adversely affected and the america segment is relatively mature and produce the large majority of our operating cash flow could result in reduced cash flow for funding the expansion of our international business and for returning cash to shareholder we are increasingly dependent on the success of our emea and cap operating segment in order to achieve our growth target our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of our emea and cap operating segment some or all of our international market business unit mbus which we generally define by the country in which they operate may not be successful in their operation or in achieving expected growth which ultimately requires achieving consistent stable net revenue and earnings the performance of these international operation may be adversely affected by economic downturn in one or more of our large mbus in particular our japan uk and china mbus account for significant portion of the net revenue and earnings of our emea and cap segment and decline in the performance of any of these mbus could have material adverse impact on the result of our international operation additionally some factor that will be critical to the success of the emea and cap segment are different than those affecting our store and licensee taste naturally vary by region and consumer in some mbus may not embrace our product to the same extent consumer in the or other international market occupancy cost and store operating expense can be higher internationally than in the due to higher rent for prime store location or cost of compliance with country specific regulatory requirement because many of our international operation are in an early phase of development operating expense percentage of related revenue are often higher compared to more developed operation such in the additionally our international joint venture partner or licensee may face capital constraint or other factor that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in certain market our international operation are also subject to additional inherent risk of conducting business abroad such foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation or requirement to transact in specific currency change or uncertainty in economic legal regulatory social and political condition in our market interpretation and application of law and regulation restrictive action of foreign or governmental authority affecting trade and foreign investment especially during period of heightened tension the and such foreign governmental authority including protective measure such export and custom duty and tariff government intervention favoring local competitor and restriction on the level of foreign ownership import or other business licensing requirement the enforceability of intellectual property and contract right of content limitation on the repatriation of fund and foreign currency exchange restriction due to current or new and international regulation in developing economy the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving targeted level of disposable income may not be fast we forecast difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operation and supply chain logistics including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service due to distance language and cultural difference well challenge in recruiting and retaining high quality employee in local market local law that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with retain or terminate employee delay in store opening for reason beyond our control competition with locally relevant competitor or lack of desirable real estate location available for lease at reasonable rate any of which could keep from meeting annual store opening target and in turn negatively impact net revenue operating income and earnings per share and disruption in energy supply affecting our market moreover many of the foregoing risk are particularly acute in developing country which are important to our long term growth prospect increase in the cost of high quality arabica coffee bean or other commodity or decrease in the availability of high quality arabica coffee bean or other commodity could have an adverse impact on our business and financial result we purchase roast and sell high quality whole bean arabica coffee bean and related coffee product the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility and although coffee price have come down from their near record high of they are still the historical average price of coffee and may increase significantly due to factor described below the high quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on negotiated basis at premium above the price this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly increase in the coffee commodity price do increase the price of high quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed price purchase commitment we frequently enter into supply contract whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated term are agreed upon but the date and therefore price at which the base coffee commodity price component will be fixed ha not yet been established these are known price to be fixed contract the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factor in the producing country including weather natural disaster crop disease general increase in farm input and cost of production inventory level and political and economic condition well the action of certain organization and association that have historically attempted to influence price of green coffee through agreement establishing export quota or by restricting coffee supply speculative trading in coffee commodity can also influence coffee price because of the significance of coffee bean to our operation combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practice and hedging activity increase in the cost of high quality arabica coffee bean could have an adverse impact on our profitability in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantity of green coffee due to any of the above factor or to worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have an adverse impact on our profitability in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amount of dairy product particularly fluid milk to support the need of our company operated retail store although le material to our operation than coffee or dairy other commodity including but not limited to those related to food input and energy are important to our operation increase in the cost of dairy product and other commodity could have an adverse impact on our profitability of content our success depends substantially on the value of our brand and failure to preserve their value could have negative impact on our financial result we believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our product for delivery of consistently positive consumer experience and for our corporate social responsibility program the starbucks brand ha been highly rated in several global brand value study to be successful in the future particularly outside of where the starbucks brand and our other brand are le well known we believe we must preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand across all sale channel brand value is based in part on consumer perception on variety of subjective quality even isolated business incident that erode consumer trust such contaminated food recall or privacy breach particularly if the incident receive considerable publicity or result in litigation can significantly reduce brand value and have negative impact on our financial result consumer demand for our product and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we or our licensee fail to preserve the quality of our product are perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner or fail to deliver consistently positive consumer experience in each of our market additionally inconsistent us of our brand and other of our intellectual property asset well failure to protect our intellectual property including from unauthorized us of our brand or other of our intellectual property asset can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have negative impact on our financial result our business depends in large part on the success of our business partner and supplier and our brand and reputation may be harmed by action taken by third party that are outside of our control our business strategy including our plan for new store foodservice branded product and other initiative relies significantly on variety of business partner and licensee and partnership relationship particularly in our international market licensee are often authorized to use our logo and provide branded beverage food and other product directly to customer we provide training and support to and monitor the operation of certain of these business partner but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factor beyond our control including financial pressure we believe customer expect the same quality of product and service from our licensee they do from and we strive to ensure customer have the same experience whether they visit company operated or licensed store any shortcoming of starbucks business partner particularly an issue affecting the quality of the service experience the safety of beverage or food or compliance with law and regulation may be attributed by customer to thus damaging our reputation and brand value and potentially affecting our result of operation our food and beverage product are sourced from wide variety of domestic and international business partner in our supply chain operation and in certain case are produced or sourced by our licensee directly we rely on these supplier and vendor to provide high quality product and to comply with applicable law our ability to find qualified supplier and vendor who meet our standard and supply product in timely and efficient manner is significant challenge especially with respect to good sourced from outside the vendor or supplier failure to meet our standard provide product in timely and efficient manner and comply with applicable law is beyond our control these issue could negatively impact our business and profitability failure to meet market expectation for our financial performance will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock

also included in our short term investment portfolio are certificate of deposit placed through an account registry service with maturity ranging from day to one year the principal amount of the individual certificate of deposit do not exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation limit our portfolio of long term available for sale security consists predominantly of high investment grade

expenditure and other corporate purpose including acquisition and share repurchase and is currently set to mature in november starbucks ha the option subject to negotiation and agreement with the related bank to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional million the interest rate for any borrowing under the credit facility based on starbucks current rating and fixed charge

these covenant use of cashwe expect to use our cash and short term investment including any potential future borrowing under the credit facility and commercial paper program to invest in our core business including new product innovation and related marketing support well other new business opportunity related to our core business we believe that future cash flow generated from operation and existing cash and short term investment both domestically and internationally will be sufficient to finance capital requirement for our core business in those respective market well shareholder distribution for the foreseeable future we consider the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary and equity investees of september to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no income and foreign withholding tax have been provided on such earnings we have not nor do we anticipate the need to repatriate fund to the to satisfy domestic liquidity need however in the event that we need to repatriate all or portion of our foreign cash to the we would be subject to additional income tax which could be material we do not believe it is practical to calculate the potential tax impact of repatriation there is significant amount of uncertainty around the calculation including the availability and amount of foreign tax credit at the time of repatriation tax rate in effect and other indirect tax consequence associated with repatriation we may use our available cash resource to make proportionate capital contribution to our equity method and cost method investees we may also seek strategic acquisition to leverage existing capability and further build our business in support of our growth agenda acquisition may include increasing our ownership interest in our equity method and cost method investees any decision to increase such ownership interest will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy significant new joint venture acquisition and or other new business opportunity may require additional outside funding discussed further in note we are in arbitration with kraft food global inc kraft for commercial dispute relating to distribution agreement we previously held with kraft part of those proceeding kraft ha claimed damage inclusive of premium and interest for terminating the arrangement we believe we have valid claim of material breach by kraft under the agreement we also believe kraft claim is highly inflated and based upon faulty analysis however should the arbitration result in an unfavorable outcome we believe we have adequate

primarily attributable to an increase in net earnings in fiscal this wa partially offset by net increase in our working capital account due primarily to increased payment on account payable cash used by investing activity totaled billion for fiscal year and net cash proceeds on investment maturity were offset by an increase in capital expenditure primarily for remodeling and renovating existing company operated store and opening new retail store the absence of cash proceeds from the sale of corporate real estate in the prior year and cash paid to acquire evolution fresh and bay bread llc doing business la boulange in the first and fourth quarter of fiscal respectively cash used by financing activity for fiscal year totaled million compared to million for fiscal year the increase wa

interest rate exposure on our available for sale security we performed sensitivity analysis based on basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available for sale security of september and determined that such change would not have significant impact on the fair value of these instrument application of critical accounting policiescritical accounting policy are those that management belief are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and result and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgment often result of the need to make estimate about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain judgment and uncertainty affecting the application of those policy may result in materially different amount being reported under different condition or using different assumption we consider financial reporting and disclosure practice and accounting policy quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment we believe that of our significant accounting policy the following policy involve higher degree of judgment and or complexity asset impairmentwhen fact and circumstance indicate that the carrying value of long lived asset may not be recoverable we evaluate long lived asset for impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the estimated future cash flow are le than the carrying value of the asset we measure an impairment loss based on the asset estimated fair value for retail asset the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level the fair value of store asset is estimated using discounted cash flow model based on internal projection key assumption used in this calculation include revenue growth operating expense and discount rate that we believe buyer would assume when determining purchase price for the store estimate of revenue growth and operating expense are based on internal projection and consider store historical performance local market economics and the business environment impacting the store performance these estimate are subjective and can be significantly impacted by change in the business or economic condition for non retail asset fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant fact and circumstance which may include discounted cash flow comparable transaction or comparable company analysis our impairment loss calculation contain uncertainty because they require management to make assumption and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flow and asset fair value including forecasting asset useful life further our ability to realize undiscounted cash flow in excess of the carrying value of our asset is affected by factor such the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the asset change in economic condition and change in operating performance during the past three fiscal year we have not made any material change in the accounting methodology that we use to ass long lived asset impairment loss for the foreseeable future we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in the estimate or assumption that we use to calculate long lived asset impairment loss however we periodically reassess estimated future cash flow and asset fair value change in our estimate and assumption may cause to realize material impairment charge in the future goodwill impairmentwe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if circumstance such material deterioration in performance or significant number of store closure indicate reporting unit carrying value may exceed their fair value when evaluating goodwill for impairment we first perform qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount if not we calculate the implied estimated fair value of the reporting unit if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value the fair value of each of our reporting unit is the price of contentswilling buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is typically calculated using discounted cash flow model key assumption used in this calculation include revenue growth operating expense and discount rate that we believe buyer would assume when determining purchase price for the reporting unit estimate of revenue growth and operating expense are based on internal projection considering reporting unit past performance and forecasted growth local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit performance the discount rate is calculated using an estimated cost of capital for retail operator to operate the reporting unit in the region these estimate are highly subjective judgment and can be significantly impacted by change in the business or economic condition our impairment loss calculation contain uncertainty because they require management to make assumption in the qualitative assessment of the reporting unit and require management to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit including estimating future cash flow and if necessary the fair value of reporting unit asset and liability further our ability to realize the future cash flow used in our fair value calculation is affected by factor such change in economic condition change in our operating performance and change in our business strategy part of our ongoing operation we may close certain store within reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease among other reason we abandon certain asset associated with closed store including leasehold improvement and other non transferable asset under gaap when portion of reporting unit that constitutes business is to be disposed of goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal our evaluation of whether the portion of reporting unit being disposed of constitutes business occurs on the date of abandonment although an operating store meet the accounting definition of business prior to abandonment it doe not constitute business on the closure date because the remaining asset on that date do not constitute an integrated set of asset that are capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing return to investor result when closing individual store we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related asset noted above if store closure are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closure occur during the past three fiscal year we have not made any material change in the accounting methodology that we use to ass goodwill impairment loss for fiscal we determined the fair value of our reporting unit wa substantially in excess of their carrying value accordingly we did not recognize any goodwill impairment during the current fiscal year we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in the estimate or assumption that we use to test for impairment loss on goodwill in the foreseeable future however we periodically reassess our fair value calculation including estimated future cash flow change in our estimate and assumption may cause to realize material impairment charge in the future self insurance reserveswe use combination of insurance and self insurance mechanism including wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in reinsurance treaty to provide for the potential liability for certain risk including worker compensation healthcare benefit general liability property insurance and director and officer liability insurance key assumption used in the estimate of our self insurance reserve include the amount of claim incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date these liability which are associated with the risk that are retained by starbucks are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claim experience demographic exposure and severity factor and other actuarial assumption the estimated accrual for these liability could be significantly affected if future occurrence and claim differ from these assumption and historical trend our self insurance reserve contain uncertainty because management is required to make assumption and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claim and claim incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date periodically we review our assumption to determine the adequacy of our self insurance reserve of contentsduring the past three fiscal year we have not made any material change in the accounting methodology that we use to calculate our self insurance reserve we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in the estimate or assumption that we use to calculate our self insurance reserve for the foreseeable future however if actual result are not consistent with our estimate or assumption we may be exposed to loss or gain that could be material change in our self insurance reserve at september would have affected net earnings by approximately million in fiscal income taxeswe recognize deferred tax asset and liability based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amount and the respective tax base of our asset and liability deferred tax asset and liability are measured using current enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which we expect the temporary difference to reverse we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax asset and may record valuation allowance if based on all available evidence we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized in addition our income tax return are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authority these audit include question regarding our tax filing position including the timing and amount of deduction taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdiction we evaluate our exposure associated with our various tax filing position we recognize tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merit of our position for uncertain tax position that do not meet this threshold we record related liability we adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitation expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available income generated in certain foreign jurisdiction ha not been subject to income tax we intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future if these amount were distributed to the in the form of dividend or otherwise we would be subject to additional income tax which could be material determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these earnings is not practicable because such liability if any is dependent on circumstance existing if and when remittance occurs deferred tax asset valuation allowance and our liability for unrecognized tax benefit require significant management judgment regarding applicable statute and their related interpretation the status of various income tax audit and our particular fact and circumstance although we believe that the judgment and estimate discussed herein are reasonable actual result could differ and we may be exposed to loss or gain that could be material to the extent we prevail in matter for which liability ha been established or are required to pay amount in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in given financial statement period could be materially affected litigation accrualswe are involved in various claim and legal action that arise in the ordinary course of business legal and other contingency reserve and related disclosure are based on our assessment of the likelihood of potential loss and our ability to estimate the loss or range of loss which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisor we record reserve related to legal matter when it is probable that loss ha been incurred and the range of such loss can be reasonably estimated such assessment are reviewed each period and revised based on current fact and circumstance and historical experience with similar claim necessary our disclosure of and accrual for litigation claim if any contain uncertainty because management is required to use judgment to estimate the probability of loss and range of possible loss related to each claim note to the consolidated financial statement describes the company legal and other contingent liability matter of contentsas we periodically review our assessment of litigation accrual we may change our assumption with respect to loss probability and range of potential loss any change in these assumption could have material impact on our future result of operation recent accounting pronouncementssee
