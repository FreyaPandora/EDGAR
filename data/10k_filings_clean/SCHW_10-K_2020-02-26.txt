change in security valuation and the failure of client to meet margin call could result in substantial loss we have exposure to credit risk associated with our investment those investment are subject to price fluctuation loss of value of security can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such loss of value ha resulted from credit loss the evaluation of whether credit loss exists is matter of judgment which includes the assessment of multiple factor if management determines that security decline in fair value is the result of credit loss an allowance for credit loss on the security will be recorded and corresponding loss will be recognized in current earnings even if decline in fair value of security is not determined to have resulted from credit loss if we were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity need we would have to recognize any unrealized loss at that time our bank loan primarily consist of first mortgage helocs and pal increase in delinquency and default rate housing and stock price decline increase in the unemployment rate and other economic factor can result in increase in allowance for credit loss

operation which may disrupt each company ongoing business and the business of the combined company schwab will incur significant transaction and merger related cost in connection with the merger we expect to incur number of non recurring cost associated with the merger and combining the operation of the two the charles schwab corporationcompanies some of these cost have already been incurred or may be incurred regardless of whether the merger is completed schwab also will incur transaction fee and cost related to formulating and implementing integration plan with respect to the two company including facility and system consolidation cost we continue to ass the magnitude of these cost and additional unanticipated cost may be incurred in the merger and the integration of the two company business although we expect that the elimination of duplicative cost well the realization of other efficiency related to the integration of the business allow to offset integration related cost over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all schwab and td ameritrade may have difficulty attracting motivating and retaining executive and other employee in light of the

depressing the market price of schwab common share based on the anticipated synergy between schwab and td ameritrade the merger is expected to be accretive to schwab earnings per share in the third year following completion of the merger however future event and condition could reduce or delay the accretion that is currently projected or result in the merger being dilutive to schwab earnings per share including adverse change in market condition additional transaction and integration related cost and other factor such the failure to realize some or all of the benefit anticipated in the merger any dilution of reduction in or delay of any accretion to schwab earnings per share could cause the price of share of schwab common stock to decline or grow at reduced rate if our pending merger with td ameritrade is completed our stockholder ownership percentage will be diluted if the proposed merger is completed we will issue to td ameritrade stockholder share of our common stock result of the

collateralized dependent on the type of security pledged collateral market value is monitored on daily basis and borrower committed line may be reduced or collateral may be liquidated if the collateral is in danger of falling below specified level such the loss inherent within this portfolio is limited the methodology to establish an allowance for loan loss for first mortgage and helocs utilizes statistical model that estimate prepayment default and probable loss for the loan segment based on predicted behavior of individual loan within the segment the methodology considers the effect of borrower behavior and variety of factor including but not limited to interest rate housing price movement measured by housing price index economic condition estimated default and foreclosure measured by historical and expected delinquency change in prepayment speed ltv ratio past loss experience estimate of future loss severity borrower credit risk and the adequacy of collateral the
