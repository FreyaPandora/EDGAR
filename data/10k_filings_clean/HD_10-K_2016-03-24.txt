and result of operation in item and our consolidated financial statement and related note in item there also may be other factor that we can not anticipate or that are not described in this report generally we do not currently perceive them to be material those factor could cause result to differ materially from our expectation strong competition could adversely affect price and demand for our product and service and could decrease our market share we operate in market that are highly competitive we compete principally based on customer service price store location and appearance and quality availability and assortment of merchandise in each market we serve there are number of other home improvement store electrical plumbing and building material supply house and lumber yard with respect to some product and service we also compete with specialty design store showroom discount store local regional and national hardware store paint store mail order firm warehouse club independent building supply store mro company and to lesser extent other retailer well with installers of home improvement product in addition we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailer some of whom may have lower cost structure than ours our customer increasingly use computer tablet smartphones and other mobile device to shop online and compare price and product in real time intense competitive pressure from one or more of our competitor or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to changing competitive landscape could affect our price our margin or demand for our product and service if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressure including through maintenance of customer service and customer relationship to deliver superior customer experience our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected of contentswe may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer need expectation or trend which could adversely affect our relationship with customer our reputation the demand for our product and service and our market share the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trend in demographic consumer preference expectation and need and unexpected weather condition while also managing appropriate inventory level and maintaining an excellent customer experience it is difficult to successfully predict the product and service our customer will demand the housing and home improvement market continues to recover resulting change in demand will put further pressure on our ability to meet customer need and expectation and maintain high service level in addition each of our primary customer group diy difm and pro have different need and expectation many of which evolve the demographic in particular customer group change if we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual need and expectation of customer group we may lose market share with respect to those customer customer expectation about the method by which they purchase and receive product or service are also becoming more demanding customer are increasingly using technology and mobile device to rapidly compare product and price determine real time product availability and purchase product product are purchased customer are seeking alternate option for delivery of those product and they often expect quick and low cost delivery we must continually anticipate and adapt to these change in the purchasing process we have implemented program like bos bopis and direct fulfillment and are rolling out bodfs but we can not guarantee that these program or others we may implement will be implemented successfully or will meet customer need and expectation customer are also using social medium to provide feedback and information about our company and product and service in manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated to the extent customer ha negative experience and share it over social medium it may impact our brand and reputation further we have an aging store base that requires maintenance and space reallocation initiative to deliver the shopping environment that our customer desire failure to maintain our store and utilize our store space effectively to provide compelling online presence to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preference expectation and home improvement need and to differentiate the customer experience for our three primary customer group could adversely affect our relationship with customer our reputation the demand for our product and service and our market share our success depends upon our ability to attract develop and retain highly qualified associate while also controlling our labor cost our customer expect high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associate to meet the need and expectation of our customer we must attract develop and retain large number of highly qualified associate while at the same time controlling labor cost our ability to control labor cost is subject to numerous external factor including prevailing wage rate and health and other insurance cost well the impact of legislation or regulation governing labor relation minimum wage or healthcare benefit an inability to provide wage and or benefit that are competitive within the market in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract employee in addition we compete with other retail business for many of our associate in hourly position and we invest significant resource in training and motivating them to maintain high level of job satisfaction these position have historically had high turnover rate which can lead to increased training and retention cost particularly if the economy continues to improve and employment opportunity increase there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associate in the future we have incurred loss related to our data breach and we are still in the process of determining the full impact of related government investigation and civil litigation on our result of operation which could have an adverse impact on our operation financial result and reputation the data breach involved the theft of certain payment

from the operation of the business have an adverse effect on our reputation and result in additional cost and fine in addition the governmental agency investigating the data breach may seek to impose injunctive relief which could of contentsmaterially increase our data security cost adversely impact how we operate our system and collect and use customer information and put at competitive disadvantage with other retailer if our effort to maintain the privacy and security of customer associate supplier and company information are not successful we could incur substantial additional cost and reputational damage and could become subject to further litigation and enforcement action our business like that of most retailer involves the receipt storage and transmission of customer personal information consumer preference and payment card information well confidential information about our associate our supplier and our company some of which is entrusted to third party service provider and vendor we also work with third party service provider and vendor that provide technology system and service that we use in connection with the receipt storage and transmission of this information our information system and those of our third party service provider and vendor are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risk unauthorized party may attempt to gain access to these system or our information through fraud or other mean of deceiving our associate third party service provider or vendor hardware software or application we develop or obtain from third

operating cost we rely on third party to provide payment processing service including the processing of credit card debit card and other form of electronic payment if these company become unable to provide these service to or if their system are compromised it could potentially disrupt our business the payment method that we offer also subject to potential fraud and theft by criminal who are
