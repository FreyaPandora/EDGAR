government entity court or regulatory body including the united state mexico canada agreement usmca and phase one trade agreement with china action of taxing authority that affect our customer business in foreign country any significant adverse economic development such extended period of high inflation material disruption in the banking sector or in the capital market of these foreign country and significant change in the valuation of the currency of these foreign country that could materially affect the cost or value of import or export shift in pattern of international trade that adversely affect import and export market material reduction in foreign direct investment in these country and public health crisis including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease such the novel coronavirus and it variant strain we are dependent on certain key supplier of locomotive and rail due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment part and maintenance potential new supplier face high barrier to entry therefore if one of the domestic supplier of high horsepower locomotive discontinues manufacturing locomotive supplying part or providing maintenance for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience significant cost increase and reduced availability of the locomotive that are necessary for our operation additionally for high percentage of our rail purchase we utilize two steel producer one domestic and one international that meet our specification rail is critical to our operation for rail replacement program maintenance and for adding additional network capacity new rail and storage yard and expansion of existing facility this industry similarly ha high barrier to entry and if one of these supplier discontinues operation for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience both significant cost increase for rail purchase and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail for maintenance and other project change to trade agreement or policy that result in increased tariff on good imported into the united state could also result in significant cost increase for rail purchase and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail human capital risk strike or work stoppage could adversely affect our operation the class railroad are party to collective bargaining agreement with various labor union the majority of our employee belong to labor union and are subject to these agreement dispute with regard to the term of these agreement or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contract with these union could result in among other thing strike work stoppage slowdown or lockout which could cause significant disruption of our operation and have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity additionally future national labor agreement or renegotiation of labor agreement or provision of labor agreement could compromise our service reliability or significantly increase our cost for health care wage and other benefit which could have material adverse impact on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity labor dispute work stoppage slowdown or lockout at loading unloading facility port or other transport access point could compromise our service reliability and have material adverse impact on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity labor dispute work stoppage slowdown or lockout by employee of our customer or our supplier could compromise our service reliability and have material adverse impact on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity the availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operation change in demographic training requirement and the availability of qualified personnel including the effect on availability from pandemic illness or restriction could negatively affect our ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increase in demand for rail service and lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risk which could have negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity legal and regulatory risk we are subject to significant governmental regulation we are subject to governmental regulation by significant number of federal state and local authority covering variety of health safety labor environmental economic discussed below tax and other matter many law and regulation require to obtain and maintain various license permit and other authorization and we can not guarantee that we will continue to be able to do our failure to comply with applicable law and regulation could have material adverse effect on government or regulator may change the legislative or regulatory framework within which we operate without providing any recourse to address any adverse effect on our business including without limitation regulatory determination or rule regarding dispute resolution increasing the amount of our traffic subject to common carrier regulation business relationship with other railroad calculation of our cost of capital or other input relevant to computing our revenue adequacy the price we charge change in tax rate enactment of new tax law and revision in tax regulation significant legislative activity in congress or regulatory activity by the stb could expand regulation of railroad operation and price for rail service which could reduce capital spending on our rail network facility and equipment and have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity for example enacted federal legislation mandated the implementation of ptc technology by december which we invested approximately billion to develop additionally one or more consolidation of class railroad also could lead to increased regulation of the rail industry we may be subject to various claim and lawsuit that could result in significant expenditure railroad with operation in densely populated urban area and vast rail network we are exposed to the potential for various claim and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage environmental liability and other matter any material change to litigation trend or catastrophic rail accident or series of accident involving any or all of property damage personal injury and environmental liability that exceed our insurance coverage for such risk could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity we are subject to significant environmental law and regulation due to the nature of the railroad business our operation are subject to

at existing site for investigation remediation and monitoring and we likely will have obligation at other site in the future liability for these obligation affect our estimate based on our experience and necessary the advice and assistance of our consultant however actual cost may vary from our estimate due to any or all of several factor including change to environmental law or interpretation of such law technological change affecting investigation and remediation the participation and financial viability of other party responsible for any such liability and the corrective action or change to corrective action required to remediate any existing or future site we could incur significant cost result of any of the foregoing and we may be required to incur significant expense to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity macroeconomic and industry risk we face competition from other railroad and other transportation provider we face competition from other railroad motor carrier ship barge and pipeline our main railroad competitor is burlington northern santa fe llc it primary subsidiary bnsf railway company bnsf operates parallel route in many of our main traffic corridor in addition we operate in corridor served by other railroad and motor carrier motor carrier competition exists for all three of our commodity group excluding most coal shipment of the proximity of our route to major inland and gulf coast waterway barge can be particularly competitive especially for grain and bulk commodity in certain area we operate in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit time quality and reliability of service from motor carrier and other railroad motor carrier in particular can have an advantage over railroad with respect to transit time and timeliness of service however railroad are much more fuel efficient than truck which reduces the impact of transporting good on the environment and public infrastructure and we have been making effort to convert truck traffic to rail additionally we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system while truck barge and maritime operator are able to use public right of way maintained by public entity any of the following could also affect the competitiveness of our transportation service for some or all of our commodity which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity improvement or expenditure materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of these alternative mode of transportation such autonomous or more fuel efficient truck ii legislation that eliminates or significantly increase the size or weight limitation applied to motor carrier or iii legislation or regulatory change that impose operating restriction on railroad or that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic many movement face product or geographic competition where our customer can use different product natural gas instead of coal sorghum instead of corn or commodity from different location grain from state or country that we do not serve crude oil from different region sourcing different commodity or different location allows shipper to substitute different carrier and such competition may reduce our volume or constrain price additionally any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect our competitive environment we may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory response to climate change climate change including the impact of global warming could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity restriction cap tax or other control on emission of greenhouse gas including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating cost restriction on emission could also affect our customer that use commodity that we carry to produce energy use significant amount of energy in producing or delivering the commodity we carry or manufacture or produce good that consume significant amount of energy or burn fossil fuel including chemical producer farmer and food producer and automaker and other manufacturer significant cost increase government regulation or change of consumer preference for good or service relating to alternative source of energy or emission reduction could materially affect the market for the commodity we carry which in turn could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity government incentive encouraging the use of alternative source of energy also could affect certain of our customer and the market for certain of the commodity we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic pattern including for example increasing royalty charged to producer of prb coal by the department of interior and the impact of ethanol incentive on farming and ethanol producer we could face increased cost related to defending and resolving legal claim and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operation on climate change violent weather caused by climate change including earthquake hurricane fire flood extreme temperature avalanche and significant precipitation could cause line outage and other interruption to our infrastructure any of these factor individually or in operation with one or more of the other factor or other unforeseen impact of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity our business financial condition and result of operation have been adversely affected and in the future could be materially adversely affected by pandemic our business financial condition and result of operation have been adversely affected by the coronavirus covid pandemic and may be affected by other pandemic covid ha caused and is expected to continue to cause global slowdown of economic activity including the decrease in demand for broad variety of good disruption in global supply chain and significant volatility and disruption of financial market and that also ha adversely affected workforce customer and regional and local economy other future pandemic may cause these or similar consequence because the severity magnitude and duration of the covid pandemic and it economic consequence are uncertain rapidly changing and difficult to predict the impact on our business and financial condition remains uncertain and difficult to predict the ultimate impact of the covid pandemic on our result of operation and financial condition remains uncertain and depends on numerous evolving factor which we may not be able to effectively respond to and are not entirely within our control these factor also may be of importance for other pandemic including not limited to governmental business and individual action that have been and continue to be taken in response to global pandemic including restriction on travel and transport workforce pressure and social distancing and shelter in place order the effect of pandemic on economic activity and action taken in response the effect on our customer and their demand for our service the effect of pandemic on the credit worthiness of our customer national or global supply chain challenge or disruption facility closure commodity cost volatility general economic uncertainty in key global market and financial market volatility global economic condition and level of economic growth and the pace of recovery the pandemic subsides well response to potential reoccurrence further pandemic and the volatile regional and global economic condition stemming from pandemic could also precipitate and aggravate the other risk factor that we identify which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition result of operation including revenue and profitability and or stock price additionally pandemic also may affect our operating and financial result in manner that is not presently known to or that we currently do not consider to present significant risk to our operation financial risk we are affected by fluctuating fuel price fuel cost constitute significant portion of our transportation expense diesel fuel price can be subject to dramatic fluctuation and significant price increase could have material adverse effect on our operating result although we currently are able to recover significant amount of our fuel expense from our customer through revenue from fuel surcharge we can not be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel cost through our fuel surcharge additionally future market condition or legislative or regulatory activity could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharge or adequately recover increased fuel cost through fuel surcharge fuel price fluctuate our fuel surcharge program trail such fluctuation in fuel price by approximately two month and may be significant source of quarter over quarter and year over year volatility particularly in period of rapidly changing price international political and economic factor event and condition affect the volatility of fuel price and supply weather can also affect fuel supply and limit domestic refining capacity severe shortage of or disruption to domestic fuel supply could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity alternatively lower fuel price could have positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer product we transport however lower fuel price could have negative impact on other commodity we transport such coal and domestic drilling related shipment which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity we rely on capital market due to the significant capital expenditure required to operate and maintain safe and efficient railroad we rely on the capital market to provide some of our capital requirement we utilize long term debt instrument bank financing and commercial paper from time to time and we pledge certain of our receivables significant instability or disruption of the capital market including the credit market or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factor could restrict or prohibit our access to and significantly increase the cost of commercial paper and other financing source including bank credit facility and the issuance of long term debt including corporate bond significant deterioration of our financial condition could result in reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade which could restrict or at certain credit level below investment grade may prohibit from utilizing our current receivables securitization facility this may also limit our access to external source of capital and significantly increase the cost of short and long term debt financing general risk factor we are affected by general economic condition prolonged severe adverse domestic and global economic condition or disruption of financial and credit market may affect the producer and consumer of the commodity we carry and may have material adverse effect on our access to liquidity result of operation and financial condition we may be

result coronavirus pandemic covid wa year of great uncertainty covid spread across the globe the pandemic caused dramatic slowdown of the economy government intervention forced closure and changed individual behavior and business transformed their operation to protect the health and safety of their employee customer and community the varying level of mitigation across different industry significant impact on the demand to ship freight in certain market segment the most notable impact on our revenue wa the temporary suspension of automotive production and the corollary effect it had on product used for auto manufacturing other reduction in production drove volume decline in number of other market well the pandemic also disrupted supply chain between asia and the united state driving decline in intermodal shipment while second quarter wa the hardest hit and volume have improved sequentially from that quarter some market segment are still lagging year over year volume are down safety the health and wellbeing of our employee wa top of mind in we navigated the continually changing environment due to covid we have and are continuing to adapt to protect the safety of our employee our customer and the community we serve enhanced safety procedure were implemented across the system including new procedure and policy based on center for disease control and prevention cdc guideline we continued our focus on safety to reduce risk and eliminate incident for our employee our customer and the public while we have implemented new practice which drove improvement in our reportable equipment incident rate per million train mile we have significant opportunity for improvement remaining our reportable personal injury incident per employee hour of wa flat with last year we continued to use total safety culture courage to care and commit coaching observing mentoring and motivating with integrity and trust throughout our operation we remained focused on identifying and managing risk and training our employee their work environment change network operation while the pandemic resulted in significant swing in volume we were able to adjust our demand driven resource to reflect these fluctuation with minimal disruption to our customer both our intermodal and manifest automotive car trip plan compliance improved point in showing our dedication to providing the customer with service product that delivers value although the environment we operated in changed due to covid we continued our operational transformation this wa evident our key performance indicator have improved substantially year over year transportation plan change to eliminate switch and improved terminal process drove an improvement in freight car terminal dwell improved dwell coupled with faster average train speed led to improvement in freight car velocity we also saw improvement in locomotive productivity and improvement in work force productivity additional detail on these metric are discussed in other operating performance and financial statistic of this item freight revenue our freight revenue decreased year over year to billion driven by volume decline of lower fuel surcharge revenue and negative mix of traffic for example relative increase in intermodal shipment which have lower average revenue per car arc partially offset by core pricing gain volume declined in almost every market segment due to the deteriorating economic condition brought on by the covid pandemic while some market rebounded in the last half of the year particularly grain and intermodal others still lagged level shipment of coal sand and petroleum product continue to be negatively impacted by the low crude oil and natural gas price financial result in we generated operating income of billion below driven by the impact of covid and non cash impairment charge of million related to our brazos yard investment productivity initiative lower volume and lower fuel price drove operating expense down from these factor coupled with improved pricing were not enough to offset the impact of the revenue decline net income of billion translated into earnings of per diluted share down from last year despite the adversity from covid our operational transformation produced an all time record operating ratio improving point from fuel price our average price of diesel fuel in wa per gallon decrease of from the lower price resulted in lower operating expense of million excluding any impact from year over year volume decline gross ton mile decreased and our fuel consumption rate computed gallon of fuel consumed divided by gross ton mile improved both driving lower fuel expense liquidity we are continually evaluating the impact of covid on our financial condition and liquidity on december we had billion of cash and cash equivalent despite the pandemic we generated billion of cash from operating activity yielding free cash flow of billion after reduction of billion for cash used in investing activity and billion in dividend even though our share repurchase program wa temporarily paused for six month starting in march we repurchased billion of our share we have been and we expect to continue to be in compliance with our debt covenant we have billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility up to million undrawn on our receivables facility and three bilateral revolving credit line which mature in may with up to million of available credit of december none of the revolving credit facility receivables facility or bilateral revolving credit line wa drawn free cash flow is defined cash provided by operating activity le cash used in investing activity and dividend paid free cash flow is not considered financial measure under gaap by sec regulation and item of sec regulation and may not be defined and calculated by other company in the same manner we believe free cash flow is important to management and investor in evaluating our financial performance and measure our ability to generate cash without additional external financing free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than substitute for cash provided by operating activity the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activity gaap measure to free cash flow non gaap measure cash provided by operating activity cash used in investing activity dividend paid free cash flow outlook safety operating safe railroad benefit all our constituent our employee customer shareholder and the community we serve we will continue using multi faceted approach to safety utilizing technology risk assessment training employee engagement quality control and targeted capital investment we will continue using and expanding the deployment of total safety culture courage to care commit and peer to peer throughout our operation which allows to identify and implement best practice for employee and operational safety we formed an operating practice command center to identify cause of mainline service interruption and develop solution in addition to assisting employee with understanding policy procedure and best practice for handling train we will continue our effort to utilize data to identify and mitigate risk detect rail defect improve or close crossing and educate the public and law enforcement agency about crossing safety through combination of our own program including risk assessment strategy industry program and local community activity across the network network operation in we will continue to transform our railroad to further increase reliability of our service product reduce variability in network operation and improve resource utilization continued implementation of train length initiative will allow to add incremental volume growth to our existing train network we will continue to make structural change to improve operational performance and efficiency more efficient network requires fewer locomotive freight car and other resource market condition we expect uncertainty with covid and the economy to continue in how government and consumer react to the resurgence mutation of the virus and distribution of the vaccine could result in or contribute to customer disruption an elongated recovery period or downturn from our current business level disruption in our customer supply chain caused by the pandemic or other factor may have an impact on our shipment in addition other factor such natural gas price weather condition and demand for other energy source may impact the coal market crude oil price spread may drive demand for petroleum product and drilling material available truck capacity could impact our intermodal business and international trade agreement could promote or hinder trade fuel price projection for crude oil and natural gas continue to fluctuate in the current environment we could see volatile fuel price during the year they are sensitive to global and domestic demand refining capacity geopolitical event weather condition and other factor price fluctuate there will be timing impact on earnings our fuel surcharge program trail increase or decrease in fuel price by approximately two month significant change in fuel price could have an impact on the amount of consumer discretionary spending impacting demand for various consumer product we transport alternatively those change could have an inverse impact on commodity such coal petroleum product and domestic drilling related shipment capital plan in we expect our capital plan to be approximately billion essentially flat with implementation of our new transportation plan ha generated capacity we will continue to harden our infrastructure replace older asset and improve the safety and resilience of the network in addition the plan includes investment intended to support growth and improve productivity and operational efficiency the capital plan may be revised if business condition warrant or if new law or regulation affect our ability to generate sufficient return on these investment see further discussion in this item under liquidity and capital resource capital plan financial expectation we expect volume to be up four to high six percent in compared to provided the second half of the year industrial production strengthens predicted by economist in the current environment we expect continued margin improvement driven by pricing opportunity in excess of inflation and ongoing productivity initiative resulting in approximately million of productivity saving while better leveraging our resource and strengthening our franchise we expect to generate strong cash from operating activity along with maintaining our dividend and share repurchase program the continued effect of covid is still uncertain it could have material impact on our financial and operating result but our focus will be on what we can manage such increasing productivity seeking new business opportunity protecting our employee customer and community and providing excellent service to our customer result of operation operating revenue change change freight revenue other subsidiary revenue accessorial revenue other total we generate freight revenue by transporting freight or other material from our three commodity group prior to we reported on four commodity group thus prior year freight revenue average revenue per car arc and carloadings have been realigned to the new reporting format freight revenue vary with volume carload and arc change in price traffic mix and fuel surcharge drive arc customer

consideration based on cumulative volume are estimated using the expected value method which is based on available historical current and forecasted volume and recognized the related performance obligation is satisfied we recognize freight revenue over time shipment move from origin to destination the allocation of revenue between reporting period is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expense recognized incurred other revenue consist primarily of revenue earned by our other subsidiary primarily logistics and commuter rail operation and accessorial revenue other subsidiary revenue are generally recognized over time shipment move from origin to destination the allocation of revenue between reporting period is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expense recognized incurred accessorial revenue are recognized at point in time performance obligation are satisfied freight revenue decreased year over year to billion driven by volume decline lower fuel surcharge and negative mix of traffic partially offset by core pricing gain volume declined in almost every market segment due to the deteriorating economic condition brought on by the covid pandemic while some market rebounded in the fourth quarter particularly grain and intermodal others still lagged level shipment of coal sand and petroleum product continue to be negatively impacted by low crude oil and natural gas price our fuel surcharge program generated freight revenue of almost billion and billion in and respectively fuel surcharge revenue in decreased million result of decrease in fuel price and reduction in carloadings partially offset by the lag impact on fuel surcharge it can generally take up to two month for changing fuel price to affect fuel surcharge recovery in other subsidiary revenue decreased from driven by the disruption of the automotive supply chain which drove lower intermodal shipment and revenue at our subsidiary that broker intermodal and transload logistics service accessorial revenue and other revenue declined driven by lower industrial product traffic the following table summarize the year over year change in freight

to an volume decline and lower fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by positive business mix and core pricing gain continued softness in market condition due to low natural gas price and weak export demand drove the decline in coal shipment the covid pandemic negatively impacted production of imported beer food product and the demand for ethanol and related product contributing to additional decline in volume strong demand for export grain particularly in the fourth quarter partially offset the loss bulk carload industrial industrial includes shipment of industrial chemical and plastic metal and mineral forest product and energy and specialized market freight revenue from industrial shipment decreased in versus due decline in volume negative mix of traffic and lower fuel surcharge partially offset by pricing gain although volume from industrial shipment were up in the first quarter it wa not enough to overcome the weak demand throughout the rest of the year the pandemic impacted wide range of industry driving year over year decline in many of our market segment including industrial chemical rock soda ash and steel in addition low oil price resulting in lower drilling coupled with local sand impact were the primary driver behind the decline in sand shipment and decline in petroleum product shipment compared to premium premium includes shipment of finished automobile automotive part and merchandise in intermodal container both domestic and international freight revenue from premium shipment decreased in compared to due to volume decline lower fuel surcharge and negative mix of traffic partially offset by core pricing gain volume decline in international intermodal due to trade uncertainty and the covid impact on supply chain between asia and

rail tie ballast and other track material depreciation expense wa essentially flat in compared to purchased service and material expense for purchased service and material includes the cost of service purchased from outside contractor and other service provider including equipment maintenance and contract expense incurred by our subsidiary for external transportation service material used to maintain the railroad line structure and equipment cost of operating facility jointly used by uprr and other railroad transportation and lodging for train crew employee trucking and contracting cost for intermodal container leased automobile maintenance expense and tool and supply purchased service and material decreased in compared to driven by reduction in all of the following locomotive maintenance expense due to smaller active fleet volume related cost for intermodal and transload service incurred by our subsidiary cost for transportation for the train crew professional service expense cost associated with derailment and year over year weather related cost fuel fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and non highway vehicle and heavy equipment locomotive diesel fuel price which averaged per gallon including tax and transportation cost in compared to per gallon in decreased expense million excluding any impact from year over year volume decline gross ton mile decreased and our fuel consumption rate computed gallon of fuel consumed divided by gross ton mile improved which both drove lower fuel expense equipment and other rent equipment and other rent expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pay for freight car owned by other railroad or private company freight car intermodal and locomotive lease and office and other rent

analysis inform our liquidity plan and activity outlined below and indicate we have sufficient capacity to sustain an extended period of lower volume at december we had working capital surplus due to an increased cash balance held due to the uncertainty related to covid compared to december where we had working capital deficit due to upcoming debt maturity past year indicate it is not unusual for to have working capital deficit however we believe it is not an indication of lack of liquidity we also maintain adequate resource including our credit facility and when necessary access the capital

board and congressional intervention the current round of negotiation began on january related to year contract negotiation historically continue for an extended period of time and work stoppage during negotiation are rare see strike or work stoppage could adversely affect our operation in the risk factor in item of this report inflation long period of inflation significantly increase asset replacement cost for capital intensive company result assuming that we replace all operating asset at current price level depreciation charge on an inflation adjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amount sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical change in interest rate could have on our result of operation and financial condition these hypothetical change do not consider other factor that could impact actual result at december we had variable rate debt representing approximately of our total debt if variable interest rate average one percentage point higher in than our december variable rate which wa approximately our interest expense would increase by approximately million this amount wa determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balance of our variable rate debt at december market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated the potential increase in fair value resulting from hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rate of december and amount to an increase of approximately billion to the fair value of our debt at december we estimated the fair value of our fixed rate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on quoted market price and current borrowing rate accounting pronouncement see note to the consolidated financial statement asserted and unasserted claim various claim and lawsuit are pending against and certain of our subsidiary we can not fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claim on our consolidated result of operation financial condition or liquidity to the extent possible we have recorded liability where asserted and unasserted claim are considered probable and where such claim can be reasonably estimated we do not expect that any known lawsuit claim environmental cost commitment contingent liability or guarantee will have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liability and insurance recovery previously recorded for these matter indemnity our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangement including certain tax indemnification can range from specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the nature of the transaction and the agreement due to uncertainty to whether claim will be made or how they will be resolved we can not reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangement we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payment under these indemnity provision climate change although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operation and financial performance in the future see risk factor under item of this report we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact however we continue to take step and explore opportunity to reduce the impact of our operation on the environment including investment in new technology using training program and technology to reduce fuel consumption and changing our operation to increase fuel efficiency critical accounting policy our consolidated financial statement have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statement requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amount of revenue expense asset and liability we base our estimate on historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily apparent from other source the following critical accounting policy are subset of our significant accounting policy described in note to the financial statement and supplementary data item these critical accounting policy affect significant area of our financial statement and involve judgment and estimate if these estimate differ significantly from actual result the impact on our consolidated financial statement may be material personal injury the cost of personal injury to employee and others related to our activity is charged to expense based on estimate of the ultimate cost and number of incident each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability including unasserted claim the federal employer liability act fela governs compensation for work related accident under fela damage are assessed based on finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlement we offer comprehensive variety of service and rehabilitation program for employee who are injured at work our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payment approximately of the recorded liability is related to asserted claim and approximately is related to unasserted claim at december because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claim it is reasonably possible that future cost to settle these claim may range from approximately million to million we record an accrual at the low end of the range no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other estimate can vary over time due to evolving trend in litigation our personal injury liability activity wa follows beginning balance current year accrual change in estimate for prior year payment ending balance at december current portion ending balance at december our personal injury claim activity wa follows open claim beginning balance new claim settled or dismissed claim open claim ending balance at december we reassess our estimated insurance recovery annually and have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recovery at december and any change to recorded insurance recovery are included in the above table in the change in estimate for prior year category environmental cost we are subject to federal state and local environmental law and regulation we have identified site where we are or may be liable for remediation cost associated with alleged contamination or for violation of environmental requirement this includes site that are the subject of action taken by the government of which are currently on the superfund national priority list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified site consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include cost relating to activity of other party in addition to cost relating to our own activity at each site when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we perform with assistance of our consultant environmental assessment on the property we expense the cost of the assessment incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such cost can be reasonably estimated our environmental liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payment our environmental liability activity wa follows beginning balance accrual payment ending balance at december current portion ending balance at december our environmental site activity wa follows open site beginning balance new site closed site open site ending balance at december the environmental liability includes future cost for remediation and restoration of site well ongoing monitoring cost but excludes any anticipated recovery from third party cost estimate are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible party and existing technology law and regulation the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible party site specific cost sharing arrangement with other potentially responsible party the degree of contamination by various waste the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the site and the speculative nature of remediation cost estimate of liability may vary over time due to change in federal state and local law governing environmental remediation current obligation are not expected to have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation financial condition or liquidity property and depreciation our railroad operation are highly capital intensive and our large base of homogeneous network type asset turn over on continuous basis each year we develop capital program for the replacement of asset and for the acquisition or construction of asset that enables to enhance our operation or provide new service offering to customer asset purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum unit of property criterion property and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on straight line basis over their estimated service life which are measured in year except for rail in high density traffic corridor all rail line except for those subject to abandonment and yard and switching track for which life are measured in million of gross ton per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all item with similar characteristic use and expected life are grouped together in asset class and are depreciated using composite depreciation rate the group method of depreciation treat each asset class pool of resource not singular item we currently have more than depreciable asset class and we may increase or decrease the number of asset class due to change in technology asset strategy or other factor we determine the estimated service life of depreciable railroad property by mean of depreciation study we perform depreciation study at least every three year for equipment and every six year for track asset rail and other track material tie and ballast and other road property our depreciation study take into account the following factor statistical analysis of historical pattern of use and retirement of each of our asset class evaluation of any expected change in current operation and the outlook for continued use of the asset evaluation of technological advance and change to maintenance practice and expected salvage to be received upon retirement for rail in high density traffic corridor we measure estimated service life in million of gross ton per mile of track it ha been our experience that the life of rail in high density traffic corridor are closely correlated to usage the amount of weight carried over the rail the service life also vary based on rail weight rail condition new or secondhand and rail type straight or curve our depreciation study for rail in high density traffic corridor consider each of these factor in determining the estimated service life for rail in high density traffic corridor we calculate depreciation rate annually by dividing the number of gross ton mile carried over the rail the weight of loaded and empty freight car locomotive and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service life of the rail measured in million of gross ton per mile rail in high density traffic corridor account for approximately percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material based on the number of gross ton mile carried over our rail in high density traffic corridor during the estimated service life of the majority of this rail ranged from approximately year to approximately year for all other depreciable asset we compute depreciation based on the estimated service life of our asset determined from the analysis of our depreciation study change in the estimated service life of our asset and their related depreciation rate are implemented prospectively estimated service life of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to change in physical use technology asset strategy and other factor that will have an impact on the retirement profile of our asset we are not aware of any specific factor that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service life of our asset actual use and retirement of our asset may vary from our current estimate which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future period change in estimated useful life of our asset due to the result of our depreciation study could significantly impact future period depreciation expense and have material impact on our consolidated financial statement if the estimated useful life of all depreciable asset were increased by one year annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately million if the estimated useful life of all depreciable asset were decreased by one year annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately million our depreciation study have resulted in lower depreciation rate for some asset class these lower rate offset the impact of projected higher depreciable asset base resulting in flat year over year total depreciation expense in versus under group depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track asset is estimated by multiplying the current replacement cost of track asset by historical index factor derived from inflation index published by the bureau of labor statistic and ii the estimated useful life of the asset determined by our depreciation study the index were selected because they closely correlate with the major cost of the property comprising the applicable track asset class because of the number of estimate inherent in the depreciation and retirement process and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variable until group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service life of our asset and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rate are appropriate in addition we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation study any deficiency or excess is amortized component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the applicable class of asset for retirement of depreciable railroad property that do not occur in the normal course of business gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meet each of the following three condition it is unusual ii it is material in amount and iii it varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation study during the last three fiscal year no gain or loss were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad property gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of asset that are not part of our railroad operation we review construction in progress asset that have not yet been placed into service for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of long lived asset or asset may not be recoverable if impairment indicator are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flow are le than the carrying value of construction in progress asset when grouped with other asset and liability at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flow are largely independent the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value income tax we account for income tax by recording tax payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax asset and liability for the expected future tax consequence of event that have been recognized in our financial statement or tax return these expected future tax consequence are measured based on current tax law the effect of future tax legislation are not anticipated future tax legislation such change in the corporate tax rate could have material impact on our financial condition result of operation or liquidity for example permanent increase in future income tax rate would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately million similarly permanent decrease in future income tax rate would decrease our deferred tax liability by approximately million when appropriate we record valuation allowance against deferred tax asset to reflect that these tax asset may not be realized in determining whether valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax asset will not be realized based on management judgment using available evidence for purpose of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize deferred tax asset in and there were no valuation allowance we recognize tax benefit that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authority the amount recognized is measured the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely to be realized upon settlement liability for unrecognized tax benefit is recorded for any tax benefit claimed in our tax return that do not meet these recognition and measurement standard pension and other postretirement benefit we use an actuarial analysis to measure the liability and expense associated with providing pension and medical and life insurance benefit opeb to eligible employee in order to use actuarial method to value the liability and expense we must make several assumption the critical assumption used to measure pension obligation and expense are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension asset for opeb the critical assumption are the discount rate and health care cost trend rate we evaluate our critical assumption at least annually and selected assumption are based on the following factor we measure the service cost and interest cost component of our net periodic benefit cost by using individual spot rate matched with separate cash flow for each future year discount rate are based on mercer yield curve of high quality corporate bond rated aa by recognized rating agency expected return on plan asset is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return taking into consideration current and expected market condition health care cost trend rate is based on our historical rate of inflation and expected market condition the following table present the key assumption used to measure net periodic pension and opeb cost benefit for and the estimated impact on net

operating expense material and supply material and supply are carried at the lower of average cost or net realizable value property and depreciation property and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on straight line basis over their estimated service life which are measured in year except for rail in high density traffic corridor all rail line except for those subject to abandonment and yard and switching track for which life are measured in million of gross ton per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all item with similar characteristic use and expected life are grouped together in asset class and are depreciated using composite depreciation rate the group method of depreciation treat each asset class pool of resource not singular item we determine the estimated service life of depreciable railroad asset by mean of depreciation study under the group method of depreciation no gain or loss is recognized when depreciable property is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business impairment of long lived asset we review long lived asset including identifiable intangible for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if impairment indicator are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flow are le than the carrying value of the long lived asset the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value revenue recognition freight revenue are derived from contract with customer we account for contract when it ha approval and commitment from both party the right of the party are identified payment term are identified the contract ha commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable our contract include private agreement private rate letter quote public circular tariff and interline foreign agreement the performance obligation in our contract is typically delivering specific commodity from place of origin to place of destination and our commitment begin with the tendering and acceptance of freight bill of lading and is satisfied upon delivery at destination we consider each freight shipment to be distinct performance obligation we recognize freight revenue over time freight move from origin to destination the allocation of revenue between reporting period is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expense recognized incurred outstanding performance obligation related to freight move in transit totaled million at december and million at december and are expected to be recognized in the following quarter we satisfy our remaining performance obligation and deliver freight to destination the transaction price is generally specified in contract and may be dependent on the commodity origin destination and route customer incentive which are primarily provided for shipping to from specific location or based on cumulative volume are recorded reduction to operating revenue customer incentive that include variable consideration based on cumulative volume are estimated using the expected value method which is based on available historical current and forecasted volume and recognized the related performance obligation is satisfied under typical payment term our customer pay after each performance obligation is satisfied and there are no material contract asset or liability associated with our freight revenue outstanding freight receivables are presented in our consolidated statement of financial position account receivables net freight

prevailing during the year unrealized gain or loss are reflected within common shareholder equity accumulated other comprehensive income or loss fair value measurement we use fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the input to valuation technique used to measure fair value into three broad level the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in it entirety fall is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in it entirety these level include level quoted market price in active market for identical asset or liability level observable market based input or unobservable input that are corroborated by market data level unobservable input that are not corroborated by market data we have applied fair value measurement to our short term investment pension plan asset impairment of long lived asset and short and long term debt stock based compensation we have several stock based compensation plan under which employee receive nonvested stock option nonvested retention share and nonvested stock unit we refer to the nonvested share and stock unit collectively retention award we issue treasury share to cover option exercise and stock unit vestings while new share are issued when retention share are granted we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based award made to employee including stock option compensation expense is based on the fair value of the award measured at the grant date and is expensed ratably over the service period of the award generally the vesting period the fair value of retention award is the closing stock price on the date of grant while the fair value of stock option is determined by using the black scholes option pricing model earnings per share basic earnings per share are calculated on the weighted average number of common share outstanding during each period diluted earnings per share include share issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock option and stock based award where the conversion of such instrument would be dilutive income tax we account for income tax by recording tax payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax asset and liability for the expected future tax consequence of event that have been recognized in our financial statement or tax return these expected future tax consequence are measured based on current tax law the effect of future tax legislation are not anticipated future tax legislation such change in the corporate tax rate could have material impact on our financial condition result of operation or liquidity when appropriate we record valuation allowance against deferred tax asset to reflect that these tax asset may not be realized in determining whether valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax asset will not be realized based on management judgment using available evidence for purpose of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize deferred tax asset we recognize tax benefit that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authority the amount recognized is measured the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely to be realized upon settlement liability for unrecognized tax benefit is recorded for any tax benefit claimed in our tax return that do not meet these recognition and measurement standard lease we lease certain locomotive freight car and other property for use in our rail operation we determine if an arrangement is or contains lease at inception operating lease asset and operating lease liability are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payment discounted using our collateralized incremental borrowing rate over the lease term at commencement date our lease term may include option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised operating lease are included in operating lease asset account payable and other current liability and operating lease liability on our consolidated statement of financial position finance lease are included in net property debt due within one year and debt due after one year on our consolidated statement of financial position operating lease expense is

month or le are not recorded on our consolidated statement of financial position lease with initial term in excess of month are recorded operating or financing lease in our consolidated statement of financial position pension and postretirement benefit we incur certain employment related expense associated with pension and postretirement health benefit in order to measure the expense associated with these benefit we must make various assumption including discount rate used to value certain liability expected return on plan asset used to fund these expense compensation increase employee turnover rate anticipated mortality rate and expected future health care cost the assumption used by are based on our historical experience well current fact and circumstance we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability associated with these benefit personal injury the cost of injury to employee and others on our property is charged to expense based on estimate of the ultimate cost and number of incident each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value legal fee and incidental cost are expensed incurred environmental when environmental issue have been identified with respect to property currently or formerly owned leased or otherwise used in the conduct of our business we perform with the assistance of our consultant environmental assessment on such property we expense the cost of the assessment incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such cost can be reasonably estimated we do not discount our environmental liability when the timing of the anticipated cash payment is not fixed or readily determinable legal fee and incidental cost are expensed incurred use of estimate the preparation of our consolidated financial statement in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect certain reported asset and liability the disclosure of certain contingent asset and liability of the date of the consolidated financial statement well the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period actual future result may differ from such estimate accounting pronouncement in february the fasb issued accounting standard update no asu lease topic asu requires

certain asset from equity to debt in alignment with our target asset allocation while we believe we can achieve long term average rate of return of we can not be certain that the portfolio will perform to our expectation asset are strategically allocated among equity debt and other investment in order to achieve diversification level that reduces fluctuation in investment return asset allocation target range for equity debt and other portfolio are evaluated at least every three year with the assistance of an independent consulting firm actual asset allocation are monitored monthly and rebalancing action are executed at least quarterly needed the pension plan investment are held in master trust the majority of pension plan asset are invested in equity security because equity portfolio have historically provided higher return than debt and other asset class over extended time horizon and are expected to do so in the future correspondingly equity investment also entail greater risk than other investment equity risk are balanced by investing significant portion of the plan asset in high quality debt security the average credit rating of the debt portfolio wa and at

total other roadway includes grading bridge and tunnel signal building and other road asset property and depreciation our railroad operation are highly capital intensive and our large base of homogeneous network type asset turn over on continuous basis each year we develop capital program for the replacement of asset and for the acquisition or construction of asset that enable to enhance our operation or provide new service offering to customer asset purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum unit of property criterion property and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on straight line basis over their estimated service life which are measured in year except for rail in high density traffic corridor all rail line except for those subject to abandonment and yard and switching track for which life are measured in million of gross ton per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all item with similar characteristic use and expected life are grouped together in asset class and are depreciated using composite depreciation rate the group method of depreciation treat each asset class pool of resource not singular item we currently have more than depreciable asset class and we may increase or decrease the number of asset class due to change in technology asset strategy or other factor we determine the estimated service life of depreciable railroad asset by mean of depreciation study we perform depreciation study at least every year for equipment and every year for track asset rail and other track material tie and ballast and other road property our depreciation study take into account the following factor statistical analysis of historical pattern of use and retirement of each of our asset class evaluation of any expected change in current operation and the outlook for continued use of the asset evaluation of technological advance and change to maintenance practice and expected salvage to be received upon retirement for rail in high density traffic corridor we measure estimated service life in million of gross ton per mile of track it ha been our experience that the life of rail in high density traffic corridor are closely correlated to usage the amount of weight carried over the rail the service life also vary based on rail weight rail condition new or secondhand and rail type straight or curve our depreciation study for rail in high density traffic corridor consider each of these factor in determining the estimated service life for rail in high density traffic corridor we calculate depreciation rate annually by dividing the number of gross ton mile carried over the rail the weight of loaded and empty freight car locomotive and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service life of the rail measured in million of gross ton per mile for all other depreciable asset we compute depreciation based on the estimated service life of our asset determined from the analysis of our depreciation study change in the estimated service life of our asset and their related depreciation rate are implemented prospectively under group depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track asset is estimated by multiplying the current replacement cost of track asset by historical index factor derived from inflation index published by the bureau of labor statistic and ii the estimated useful life of the asset determined by our depreciation study the index were selected because they closely correlate with the major cost of the property comprising the applicable track asset class because of the number of estimate inherent in the depreciation and retirement process and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variable until group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service life of our asset and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rate are appropriate in addition we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation study any deficiency or excess is amortized component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the applicable class of asset for retirement of depreciable railroad property that do not occur in the normal course of business gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meet each of the following three condition is unusual ii is material in amount and iii varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation study gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of asset that are not part of our railroad operation we review construction in progress asset that have not yet been placed into service for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of long lived asset or asset may not be recoverable if impairment indicator are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flow are le than the carrying value of construction in progress asset when grouped with other asset and liability at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flow are largely independent the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value when we purchase an asset we capitalize all cost necessary to make the asset ready for it intended use however many of our asset are self constructed large portion of our capital expenditure is for replacement of existing track asset and other road property which is typically performed by our employee and for track line expansion and other capacity project cost that are directly attributable to capital project including overhead cost are capitalized direct cost that are capitalized part of self constructed asset include material labor and work equipment indirect cost are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset cost incurred that extend the useful life of an asset improve the safety of our operation or improve operating efficiency are capitalized while normal repair and maintenance are expensed incurred these cost are allocated using appropriate statistical base total expense for repair and maintenance incurred wa billion for billion for and billion for asset held under finance lease are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payment or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease amortization expense is computed using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the period of the related lease brazos yard impairment in the fourth quarter of we made the strategic decision that our brazos yard investment made to date will be used for freight car block swapping activity rather than proceeding with additional investment required to complete the freight car classification yard result we

contingency asserted and unasserted claim various claim and lawsuit are pending against and certain of our subsidiary we can not fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claim on our consolidated result of operation financial condition or liquidity to the extent possible we have recorded liability where asserted and unasserted claim are considered probable and where such claim can be reasonably estimated we do not expect that any known lawsuit claim environmental cost commitment contingent liability or guarantee will have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liability and insurance recovery previously recorded for these matter personal injury the cost of personal injury to employee and others related to our activity is charged to expense based on estimate of the ultimate cost and number of incident each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability including unasserted claim the federal employer liability act fela governs compensation for work related accident under fela damage are assessed based on finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlement we offer comprehensive variety of service and rehabilitation program for employee who are injured at work our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payment approximately of the recorded liability is related to asserted claim and approximately is related to unasserted claim at december because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claim it is reasonably possible that future cost to settle these claim may range from approximately million to million we record an accrual at the low end of the range no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other estimate can vary over time due to evolving trend in litigation our personal injury liability activity wa follows beginning balance current year accrual change in estimate for prior year payment ending balance at december current portion ending balance at december we reassess our estimated insurance recovery annually and have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recovery at december and any change to recorded insurance recovery are included in the above table in the change in estimate for prior year category environmental cost we are subject to federal state and local environmental law and regulation we have identified site at which we are or may be liable for remediation cost associated with alleged contamination or for violation of environmental requirement this includes site that are the subject of action taken by the government of which are currently on the superfund national priority list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified site consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include cost relating to activity of other party in addition to cost relating to our own activity at each site when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we perform with assistance of our consultant environmental assessment on the property we expense the cost of the assessment incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such cost can be reasonably estimated our environmental liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payment our environmental liability activity wa follows beginning balance accrual payment ending balance at december current portion ending balance at december the environmental liability includes future cost for remediation and restoration of site well ongoing monitoring cost but excludes any anticipated recovery from third party cost estimate are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible party and existing technology law and regulation the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible party site specific cost sharing arrangement with other potentially responsible party the degree of contamination by various waste the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the site and the speculative nature of remediation cost estimate of liability may vary over time due to change in federal state and local law governing environmental remediation current obligation are not expected to have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation financial condition or liquidity insurance the company ha consolidated wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary the captive that provides insurance coverage for certain risk including fela claim and property coverage that are subject to reinsurance the captive entered into annual reinsurance treaty agreement that insure worker compensation general liability auto liability and fela risk the captive cedes portion of it fela exposure through the treaty and assumes proportionate

into these contingent guarantee in the normal course of business and they include guaranteed obligation related to our affiliated operation the final guarantee expires in we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require to satisfy these guarantee we do not expect that these guarantee will have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition result of operation or liquidity indemnity we are contingently obligated under variety of indemnification arrangement although in some case the extent of our potential liability is limited depending on the nature of the transaction and the agreement due to uncertainty to whether claim will be made or how they will be resolved we can not reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangement we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payment under these indemnity provision share repurchase program effective april our board of director authorized the repurchase of up to million share of our common stock by march replacing our
