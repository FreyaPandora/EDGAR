employee are vital to our success we believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel in highly competitive labor market due to our competitive compensation and benefit and our rewarding work environment seasonalityworldwide sale not reflect significant degree of seasonality however the number of medical procedure incorporating medtronic product is generally lower during summer month due to summer vacation schedule in the northern hemisphere particularly in european country in addition pulse oximetry sale may be impacted by flu season of contentsgovernment regulation and other considerationsour product are subject to regulation by numerous government agency including the fda and similar agency outside the to varying degree each of these agency requires to comply with law and regulation governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our product our business is also affected by patient privacy law cost containment initiative and environmental health and safety law and regulation the primary law and regulation that affect our business are described product approval processesauthorization to commercially distribute new medical device or technology in the is generally received in one of two way the first known pre market notification or the process requires to demonstrate that our new medical device or technology is substantially equivalent to legally marketed medical device or technology in this process we must submit data that support our equivalence claim if human clinical data is required it must be gathered in compliance with fda investigational device exemption regulation we must receive an order from the fda finding substantial equivalence to another legally marketed medical device or technology before we are able to commercially distribute the new medical device or technology modification to cleared medical device or technology may be made without using the process if the change do not significantly affect safety or effectiveness minimally invasive therapy group product are generally subject to the pre market notification process small number of our device are exempt from pre market review the second more rigorous process known pre market approval pma requires to independently demonstrate that the new medical device is safe and effective we do this by collecting data regarding design material bench and animal testing and human clinical data for the medical device the fda will authorize commercial distribution if it determines there is reasonable assurance that the medical device is safe and effective this determination is based on the benefit outweighing the risk for the population intended to be treated with the device this process is much more detailed time consuming and expensive than the process third seldom used process for approval exists for humanitarian use device intended for patient population of le than patient per year in the this exemption is similar to the pma process however full showing of product effectiveness from large clinical trial is not required the threshold for approving these product is probable benefit and safety many country outside the to which we sell medical device also subject such medical device and technology to their own regulatory requirement frequently regulatory approval may first be obtained in country outside of the prior to application in the due to differing regulatory requirement however country such china for example require approval in the country of origin first most country outside of the require that product approval be recertified on regular basis generally every five year the recertification process requires that we evaluate any device or technology change and any new regulation or standard relevant to the device or technology and where needed conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance where recertification application are required they must be approved in order to continue selling our product in those country export control and economic sanction law and regulation are complex and constantly changing it is possible that law and regulation may be enacted amended enforced or interpreted in manner materially impacting our ability to sell or distribute product in the single regulatory approval process exists and conformity with the legal requirement is represented by the ce mark to obtain ce mark defined product must meet minimum standard of performance safety and quality the essential requirement and then according to their classification comply with one or more of selection of conformity assessment route notified body ass the quality management system of the manufacturer and the product conformity to the essential and other requirement within the medical device directive we are subject to inspection by notified body for compliance the competent authority of the country generally in the form of their ministry or department of health oversee the clinical research for medical device and are responsible for market surveillance of product once they are placed on the market we are required to report device failure and injury potentially related to product use to these authority in timely manner various penalty exist for non compliance with the law transcribing the medical device directive new medical device regulation ha been published by the in which will impose significant additional premarket and postmarket requirement the regulation ha three year implementation period and after that time all product marketed in the will require certification according to these new requirement to be sold in japan most medical device must undergo thorough safety examination and demonstrate medical efficacy before they are granted approval or shonin the japanese government through the ministry of health labour and welfare mhlw regulates medical device under the pharmaceutical affair law pal oversight for medical device is conducted with participation by the pharmaceutical and medical device agency pmda quasi government organization performing many of the review function for mhlw penalty for company noncompliance with pal could be severe including revocation or suspension of company business license and criminal sanction mhlw and pmda also ass the quality management system of the manufacturer and the product conformity to the requirement of the pal medtronic is subject to inspection for compliance by these agency of contentsour global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable which could increase the time cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approval for our product several country that not have regulatory requirement for medical device have established such requirement in recent year and other country have expanded or plan to expand on existing regulation certain regulator are requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data while harmonization of global regulation ha been pursued requirement continue to differ significantly among country we expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact our ability to obtain future approval for our product or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approval in the future there may be no assurance that any new medical device we develop will be approved in timely or cost effective manner or approved at all ongoing fda regulationsboth before and after product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibility under fda regulation the fda review design and manufacturing practice labeling and record keeping and manufacturer required report of adverse experience and other information to identify potential problem with marketed medical device we are also subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda quality system regulation which govern the method used in and the facility and control used for the design manufacture packaging and servicing of all finished medical device intended for human use in addition the fda and other regulatory body including the federal trade commission the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human service the department of justice and various state attorney general monitor the manner in which we promote and advertise our product although surgeon are permitted to use their medical judgment to employ medical device for indication other than those cleared or approved by the fda the fda ha prohibited manufacturer from promoting product for such label us and ha taken the position that manufacturer may only market their product for cleared or approved us if the fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable law or regulation or that any of our medical device are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the fda could require to notify health professional and others that the device present unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health order recall repair replacement or refund of such device detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical device or ban such medical device the fda may also impose operating restriction enjoin and or restrain certain conduct resulting in violation of applicable law pertaining to medical device including hold on approving new device issue are resolved to it satisfaction and ass civil or criminal penalty against our officer employee or the fda may also recommend prosecution to the department of justice conduct giving rise to civil or criminal penalty may also form the basis for private civil litigation by third party payer or other person allegedly harmed by our conduct in april we entered into consent decree with the fda relating to our pain therapy division synchromed drug infusion system and the neuromodulation quality system the consent decree requires to complete certain correction and enhancement to the synchromed pump and the neuromodulation quality system the consent decree limit our ability to manufacture and distribute the synchromed drug infusion system unless specific condition are met the agreement doe not require the retrieval of any of our product but we must retain third party expert to inspect the neuromodulation quality system and to provide certification that the system complies with the requirement of the consent decree once this certification is accepted by the fda and fda inspection is successfully completed the limitation on manufacturer and distribution of synchromed pump will be lifted thereafter we must submit periodic audit report to the fda to ensure ongoing compliance with the consent decree in june tyrx inc received warning letter from the fda following an inspection at the tyrx facility in monmouth junction new jersey we are taking action to address the warning letter and upon successful reinspection by the fda the warning letter will be lifted in june heartware inc received warning letter from the fda following an inspection at the heartware facility in miami lake florida medtronic acquired heartware in august and is implementing action and process improvement to address the item in the warning letter upon successful reinspection by fda the warning letter will be lifted of contentsgovernmental trade regulationsthe

compliance with evolving regulation and standard in data privacy and cybersecurity relating to the confidentiality and security of our information technology system product such medical device and other service provided by may result in increased cost lower revenue new complexity in compliance new challenge for competition and the threat of increased regulatory enforcement activity our business relies on the secure electronic transmission storage and hosting of sensitive information including personal information protected health information financial information intellectual property and other sensitive information related to our customer and workforce of contentsfor example in the the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of certain personal information and the security of medical device are regulated at the federal and state international and industry level federal and state law protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information including patient medical record and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by health care provider privacy and security rule under the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa amended and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of hitech govern the use disclosure and security of protected health information by covered entity which are health care provider that submit electronic claim health plan and health care clearinghouses and by their business associate which is anyone that performs service on behalf of covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information and is not member of the covered entity workforce rule under hipaa and hitech include specific security standard and breach notification requirement department of health and human service hhs through the office of civil right ha direct enforcement authority against covered entity and business associate with regard to both the security and privacy rule including civil and criminal liability medtronic is generally not covered entity with exception such our diabetes business medtronic monitoring inc beacon idtf and our health insurance plan medtronic also operates business associate to covered entity in limited number of instance in those case the patient data that we receive and analyze may include protected health information there are comparable state level law governing the use and protection of personal health information by health care provider and medtronic may be subject to these law in certain of it business the fda ha issued guidance advising manufacturer to take cybersecurity risk into account in product design for connected medical device and system to assure that appropriate safeguard are in place to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or modification to medical device that contain software and reduce the risk of introducing threat into hospital system that are connected to such device the fda also issued guidance on post market management of cyber security in medical device in addition to the regulation of personal health information number of state have also adopted law and regulation that may affect our privacy and data security practice for other kind of personally identifiable information such state law that govern the use disclosure and protection of sensitive personal information such social security number or that are designed to protect credit card account data state and local authority increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individual from identity theft with state now enacting law requiring business to notify individual of security breach involving personal information state consumer protection law may also establish privacy and security standard for use and management of personally identifiable information including information related to consumer and care provider outside the we are impacted by the privacy and data security requirement at the international national and regional level and on an industry specific basis we serve customer in approximately country legal requirement in these country relating to the collection storage handling and transfer of personal data and potentially intellectual property continue to evolve with increasingly strict enforcement regime more privacy and security law and regulation are being adopted and more are being enforced with potential for significant financial penalty in the increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rule that will have substantial impact on the use of patient data across the healthcare industry are scheduled to go into effect in may these law and regulation impact the way in which we use and manage personal data protected health information and our information technology system they also impact our ability to move store and access data across geographic boundary compliance with these requirement may require change in business practice complicate our operation and add complexity and additional management and oversight need they also may complicate our clinical research activity well product offering that involve transmission or use of clinical data because the law and regulation continue to expand differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are subject to evolving and at time inconsistent governmental interpretation compliance with these law and regulation may require significant cost expenditure or change in product or business that reduce revenue noncompliance could result in the imposition of fine penalty or order to stop noncompliant activity cost containment initiativesgovernment and private sector initiative to limit the growth of health care cost including price regulation competitive pricing bidding and tender mechanic coverage and payment policy comparative effectiveness of therapy technology assessment and managed care arrangement are continuing in many country where we do business including the these change are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost effective medical device and therapy government program including medicare and medicaid private health care insurance and managed care plan have attempted to control cost by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedure or treatment tying reimbursement to outcome shifting to population health management and other mechanism designed to constrain utilization and contain cost hospital which purchase implant are also seeking to reduce cost through variety of mechanism including for example creating centralized purchasing function that set pricing and in some case limiting the number of vendor that may participate of contentsin the purchasing program hospital are also aligning interest with physician through employment and other arrangement such gainsharing where hospital agrees with physician to share any realized cost saving resulting from the physician collective change in practice pattern such standardization of device where medically appropriate this ha created an increasing level of price sensitivity among customer for our product some third party payer must also approve coverage and set reimbursement level for new or innovative device or therapy before they will reimburse health care provider who use the medical device or therapy even though new medical device may have been cleared for commercial distribution we may find limited demand for the device until coverage and sufficient reimbursement level have been obtained from governmental and private third party payer in addition some private third party payer require that certain procedure or that the use of certain product be authorized in advance condition of reimbursement example of cost containment initiative and health care reform in market significant to medtronic business outside of the include japan where the government review reimbursement rate benchmark every two year which may significantly reduce reimbursement for procedure using our medical device or deny coverage for those procedure result of our manufacturing efficiency cost control and other cost saving initiative we believe we are well positioned to respond to change resulting from the worldwide trend toward cost containment however uncertainty remains to the nature of any future legislation new or changed coverage and reimbursement from government or private payer or decision or other reform making it difficult for to predict the potential impact of cost containment trend on future operating result regulation governing reimbursementthe delivery of our device is subject to regulation by hhs and comparable state and non agency responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care item and service law and regulation are imposed primarily in connection with the medicare and medicaid program well the government interest in regulating the quality and cost of health care other government also impose regulation in connection with their health care reimbursement program and the delivery of health care item and service federal health care law apply when we or customer submit claim for item or service that are reimbursed under medicare medicaid or other federally funded health care program the principal federal law include the anti kickback statute which prohibits offer to pay or receive remuneration of any kind for the purpose of purchasing ordering recommending making referral to item or service reimbursable by federal health care program the false claim act which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claim for payment to federally funded health care program including claim resulting from violation of the anti kickback statute the stark law which prohibits physician from referring medicare or medicaid patient to provider that bill these program for the provision of certain designated health service if the physician or member of the physician immediate family ha financial relationship with that provider and health care fraud statute that prohibit false statement and improper claim to any third party payer there are often similar state false claim anti kickback and anti self referral and insurance law that apply to state funded medicaid and other health care program and private third party payer insurance company may also bring private cause of action for treble damage against manufacturer for pattern of causing false claim to be filed under the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organization act or rico in addition manufacturer the fda approved device reimbursable by federal healthcare program are subject to the physician payment sunshine act which requires to annually report certain payment and other transfer of value we make to licensed physician or teaching hospital further the foreign corrupt practice act fcpa may be used to prosecute company in the for arrangement with physician or other party outside the if the physician or party is government official of another country and the arrangement violates the law of that country the law and regulation of health care good and service that are applicable to including those described above are subject to evolving interpretation and enforcement discretion if governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable law and regulation we and our officer and employee could be subject to severe criminal and civil financial penalty including for example exclusion from participation supplier of product to beneficiary covered by medicare or medicaid any failure to comply with law and regulation relating to reimbursement and health care good and service could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and cash flow our profitability and operation are subject to risk relating to change in legislative regulatory and reimbursement policy and decision well change to private payer reimbursement coverage and payment decision and policy implementation of further legislative or administrative reform to reimbursement system or adverse decision relating to our product by administrator of these system in coverage or reimbursement could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our product and the price that our customer are willing to pay for of contentsenvironmental health and safety lawswe are also subject to various environmental health and safety law and regulation both within and outside the similar to other company in our industry our manufacturing and other operation involve the use and transportation of substance regulated under environmental health and safety law including those related to the transportation of hazardous material to the best of our knowledge at this time we do not expect that compliance with environmental protection law will have material impact on our consolidated result of operation financial position and or cash flow litigation riskspatent litigation we operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation patent litigation may result in significant damage award and injunction that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected product or result in significant royalty payment in order to continue selling the product at any given time we are involved both plaintiff and defendant in number of patent infringement action the outcome of which may not be known for prolonged period of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation incident to our business we believe the outcome associated with this type of litigation could have material adverse impact on our consolidated result of operation financial position or cash flow for additional information see item risk factor we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary right and failing to protect such right or to be successful in litigation related to our right or the right of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damage and or royalty payment negatively impact our ability to sell current or future product or prohibit from enforcing our patent and other proprietary right against others and note to the consolidated financial statement in item financial statement and supplementary data in this annual report on form product liability and other claim we operate in an industry susceptible to significant product liability claim these claim may be brought by individual seeking relief on their own behalf or purporting to represent class we are also susceptible to other litigation including private security litigation shareholder derivative suit and contract litigation these claim may be asserted against in the future based on event we are not aware of at the present time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of product liability litigation we believe the outcome associated with this type of litigation could have material adverse impact on our consolidated result of operation financial position or cash flow for additional information see item risk factor quality problem with and product liability claim in connection with our process product and service could lead to recall or safety alert harm to our reputation or adverse verdict or costly settlement and could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and our cash flow and note to the consolidated financial statement in item financial statement and supplementary data in this annual report on form insurancewe have elected to self insure most of our insurable risk and we made this decision based on cost and availability factor in the insurance marketplace we continue to maintain director and officer liability insurance policy providing coverage for our director and officer we continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value to of obtaining insurance coverage for other category of loss in the future based on historical loss trend we believe that our self insurance program accrual and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future loss historical trend however may not be indicative of future loss the absence of third party insurance coverage for other category of loss increase our exposure to unanticipated claim and these loss could have material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings financial condition and or cash flow executive

not the only one related to our business and are not necessarily listed in the order of their importance additional risk and uncertainty not presently known to or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business of contentsrisks relating to the companywe operate in highly competitive industry and we may be unable to compete effectively we compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical market in approximately country throughout the world these market are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advance and scientific discovery in the product line in which we compete we face mixture of competitor ranging from large manufacturer with multiple business line to small manufacturer that offer limited selection of niche product development by other company of new or improved product process technology or the introduction of reprocessed product or generic version when our proprietary product lose their patent protection may make our product or proposed product le competitive in addition we face competition from provider of alternative medical therapy such pharmaceutical company competitive factor include product reliability product performance product technology product quality breadth of product line product service customer support price and reimbursement approval from health care insurance provider we also face competition for marketing distribution and collaborative development agreement for establishing relationship with academic and research institution and for license to intellectual property in addition academic institution governmental agency and other public and private research organization also may conduct research seek patient protection and establish collaborative arrangement for discovery research clinical development and marketing of product similar to these company and institution compete with in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel well in acquiring necessary product technology major shift in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problem physician advisory safety alert and publication about our product reflecting the importance of product quality product efficacy and quality system in our industry in the current environment of managed care consolidation among health care provider increased competition and declining reimbursement rate we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price in order to continue to compete effectively we must continue to create invest in or acquire advanced technology incorporate this technology into our proprietary product obtain regulatory approval in timely manner and manufacture and successfully market our product given these factor we not guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively or continue our level of success in our industry reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative source for supply or other manufacturing difficulty may adversely affect our manufacturing operation and related product sale the manufacture of our product requires the timely delivery of sufficient amount of quality component and material and is highly exacting and complex due in part to strict regulatory requirement we manufacture most of our product at numerous manufacturing facility located throughout the world we purchase many of the component and raw material used in manufacturing these product from numerous supplier in various country we have generally been able to obtain adequate supply of such raw material and component however for reason of quality assurance cost effectiveness or availability we procure certain component and raw material from sole supplier we work closely with our supplier to try to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability however we can not guarantee that these effort will be successful in addition due to the stringent regulation and requirement of the fda regarding the manufacture of our product we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement source for certain component or material reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative source for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our product in timely or cost effective manner and to make our related product sale other problem in the manufacturing process including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocol and procedure defective raw material and environmental factor could lead to launch delay product shortage unanticipated cost lost revenue and damage to our reputation failure to identify and address manufacturing problem prior to the release of product to our customer may also result in quality or safety issue in addition several of our key product are manufactured at single manufacturing facility with limited alternate facility if an event occurs that result in damage to one or more of such facility we may be unable to manufacture the relevant product at of contentsthe previous level or at all because of the time required to approve and license manufacturing facility third party manufacturer may not be available on timely basis to replace production capacity in the event manufacturing capacity is lost moreover pursuant to the conflict mineral requirement promulgated by the sec part of dodd frank we are required to report on the source of any conflict mineral used in our product well the process we use to determine the source of such material we will continue to incur expense we work with our supplier to evaluate the source of any conflict mineral in our product and compliance with these requirement could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of our raw material our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authority which may lead to greater regulation in the future our medical device and technology and our business activity are subject to complex regime of regulation and an aggressive enforcement environment including by the fda department of justice health and human service office of the inspector general and numerous other federal state and non governmental authority these authority and member of congress have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry in addition certain state government and the federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interaction with health care provider result we are required by law to disclose payment and other transfer of value to health care provider licensed by certain state and to all physician and teaching hospital at the federal level any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirement could impact our business in addition we will continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resource to further develop and implement policy system and process to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirement which may also impact our business we anticipate that governmental authority will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that additional regulation may increase compliance and legal cost exposure to litigation and other adverse effect to our operation we are subject to costly and complex law and governmental regulation and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operation our medical device are subject to regulation by numerous government agency including the fda and comparable agency outside the to varying degree each of these agency requires to comply with law and regulation governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our product we can not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain marketing clearance for our new product or enhancement or modification to existing product and the failure to maintain approval or obtain approval or clearance could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow even if we are able to obtain such approval or clearance it may take significant amount of time require the expenditure of substantial resource involve stringent clinical and pre clinical testing well increased post market surveillance involve modification repair or replacement of our product and result in limitation on the proposed us of our product both before and after product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibility under fda regulation many of our facility and procedure and those of our supplier are also subject to periodic inspection by the fda to determine compliance with the fda requirement including primarily the quality system regulation and medical device reporting regulation the result of these inspection can include inspectional observation on fda form warning letter or other form of enforcement since the fda ha significantly increased it oversight of company subject to it regulation including medical device company by hiring new investigator and stepping inspection of manufacturing facility if the fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable law or regulation or that any of our medical device are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the fda could ban such medical device detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical device order recall repair replacement or refund of such device refuse to grant pending pre market approval application or require certificate of non government for export and or require to notify health professional and others that the device present unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health the fda may also ass civil or criminal penalty against our officer or employee and impose operating restriction on company wide basis or enjoin and or restrain certain conduct resulting in violation of applicable law the fda may also recommend prosecution to the department of justice any adverse regulatory action depending on it magnitude may restrict from effectively marketing and selling our product and limit our ability to obtain future pre market clearance or approval and could result in substantial modification to our business practice and operation in addition the fda ha taken the position that device manufacturer are prohibited from promoting their product other than for the us and indication set forth in the approved product labeling number of enforcement action have been taken against manufacturer that promote product for off label us including action alleging that federal health care program reimbursement of product promoted for off label us constitute false and fraudulent claim to the government the failure to of contentscomply with off label promotion restriction can result in significant civil or criminal exposure administrative obligation and cost and or other potential penalty from and or agreement with the federal government pursuant to dodd frank the sec promulgated final rule regarding disclosure of the use of certain mineral known conflict mineral tantalum tin tungsten or their ore and gold which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining country under the rule we are now required to disclose the procedure we employ to determine the sourcing of such mineral and metal produced from those mineral there are cost associated with complying with these disclosure requirement including for diligence in regard to the source of any conflict mineral used in our product in addition to the cost of remediation and other change to product process or source of supply consequence of such verification activity in addition the implementation of these rule could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of material used in our product of the date of our conflict mineral report for the calendar year we were unable to obtain the necessary information on conflict mineral from all of our supplier and were unable to determine that all of our product are conflict free in addition we may continue to face difficulty in gathering this information in the future we may face reputational challenge if we determine that certain of our product contain mineral not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origin for all conflict mineral used in our product through the procedure we implement governmental regulation outside the have become increasingly stringent and more common and we may become subject to more rigorous regulation by governmental authority in the future in the european union for example new medical device regulation wa published in which when it enters into full force will impose significant additional premarket and post market requirement penalty for company non compliance with governmental regulation could be severe including fine and revocation or suspension of company business license mandatory price reduction and criminal sanction any governmental law or regulation imposed in the future may have material adverse effect on we are subject to environmental law and regulation and the risk of environmental liability violation and litigation we are subject to numerous federal state local and non environmental health and safety law and regulation concerning among other thing the health and safety of our employee the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous material emission or discharge of substance into the environment investigation and remediation of hazardous substance or material at various site chemical constituent in medical product and end of life disposal and take back program for medical device our operation involve the use of substance regulated under such law and regulation primarily those used in manufacturing and sterilization process if we violate these environmental law and regulation we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulator furthermore environmental law outside of the are becoming more stringent resulting in increased cost and compliance burden in addition certain environmental law ass liability on current or previous owner or operator of real property for the cost of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substance or material at their property or at property which they have disposed of hazardous substance liability for investigative removal and remedial cost under certain federal and state law are retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup action brought by governmental authority private party could bring personal injury or other claim due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substance the ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash outflow is difficult to predict given the uncertainty regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable law and regulation and alternative cleanup method we may in the future be subject to additional environmental claim for personal injury or cleanup based on our past present or future business activity including the past activity of company we have acquired the cost of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety law and regulation or liability arising from past or future release of or exposure to hazardous substance may exceed our estimate or have material adverse effect on our business consolidated earnings financial condition and or cash flow our failure to comply with law and regulation relating to reimbursement of health care good and service may subject to penalty and adversely impact our reputation business financial condition and cash flow our device product and therapy are purchased principally by hospital or physician that typically bill various third party payer such governmental program medicare medicaid and comparable non program private insurance plan and managed care plan for the healthcare service provided to their patient the ability of our customer to obtain appropriate reimbursement for product and service from third party payer is critical because it affect which product customer purchase and the price they are willing to pay result our device product and therapy are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by hhs including the center for medicare medicaid service cm well comparable state and non agency responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care good and service the principal federal law implicated include those that prohibit the filing of false or improper claim for federal payment known the false claim law ii unlawful inducement for the referral of business reimbursable under federally funded health care program known the anti kickback law and iii health care service provider from seeking reimbursement for providing certain service to patient who of contentswas referred by physician who ha certain type of direct or indirect financial relationship with the service provider known the stark law many state have similar law that apply to reimbursement by state medicaid and other funded program well in some case to all payer insurance company can also bring private cause of action claiming treble damage against manufacturer for causing false claim to be filed under the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organization act rico in addition manufacturer of fda approved device reimbursable by federal healthcare program we are subject to the physician payment sunshine act which requires to annually report certain payment and other transfer of value we make to licensed physician or teaching hospital our profitability and international operation are subject to risk relating to change in government and private medical reimbursement program and policy and change in legal regulatory requirement in the and around the world implementation of further legislative or administrative reform to the reimbursement system in the and outside of the or adverse decision relating to our product by administrator of these system in coverage or reimbursement could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our product and the price that our customer are willing to pay for them the law and regulation of health care good and service that are applicable to including those described above are subject to evolving interpretation and enforcement discretion if governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable law and regulation we and our officer and employee could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalty including for example exclusion from participation supplier of product to beneficiary covered by cm any failure to comply with law and regulation relating to reimbursement and health care good and service could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and cash flow we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary right and failing to protect such right or to be successful in litigation related to our right or the right of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damage and or royalty payment negatively impact our ability to sell current or future product or prohibit from enforcing our patent and other proprietary right against others we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary right and rely on combination of patent trade secret and non disclosure and non competition agreement to protect our proprietary intellectual property we also operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation patent litigation against can result in significant damage award and injunction that could prevent our manufacture and sale of affected product or require to pay significant royalty in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected product at any given time we are generally involved both plaintiff and defendant in number of patent infringement action the outcome of which may not be known for prolonged period of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation we believe the result associated with any such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damage and or royalty payment negatively impact our ability to sell current or future product or prohibit from enforcing our patent and proprietary right against others which would generally have material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings financial condition and or cash flow while we intend to defend against any threat to our intellectual property our patent trade secret or other agreement may not adequately protect our intellectual property further pending patent application owned by may not result in patent being issued to patent issued to or licensed by in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitor and such patent may be found invalid unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide with any competitive advantage third party could obtain patent that may require to negotiate license to conduct our business and the required license may not be available on reasonable term or at all we also rely on non disclosure and non competition agreement with certain employee consultant and other party to protect in part trade secret and other proprietary right we can not be certain that these agreement will not be breached that we will have adequate remedy for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third party will not otherwise gain access to our trade secret or proprietary knowledge in addition the law of certain country in which we market some of our product do not protect our intellectual property right to the extent the law of the which could make it easier for competitor to capture market position in such country by utilizing technology that are similar to those developed or licensed by competitor also may harm our sale by designing product that mirror the capability of our product or technology without infringing our intellectual property right if we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these country it could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition or result of operation of contentsquality problem with and product liability claim in connection with our process product and service could lead to recall or safety alert harm to our reputation or adverse verdict or costly settlement and could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and our cash flow quality is extremely important to and our customer due to the serious and costly consequence of product failure and our business expose to potential product liability risk that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical device in addition many of our product are often used in intensive care setting with seriously ill patient and some of the medical device we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long period of time or indefinitely component failure manufacturing defect design flaw off label use or inadequate disclosure of product related risk or product related information with respect to our product could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of patient these problem could lead to recall of or issuance of safety alert relating to our product and could result in product liability claim and lawsuit including class action which could ultimately result in certain case in the removal from the body of such product and claim regarding cost associated therewith due to the strong name recognition of the medtronic and covidien brand material adverse event involving one of our product could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all product within that brand and could harm our reputation and ability to market product in the future strong product quality is critical to the success of our good and service if we fail to meet these standard and our product are the subject of recall or safety alert our reputation could be damaged we could lose customer and our revenue and result of operation could decline our success also depends generally on our ability to manufacture to exact tolerance precision engineered component subassemblies and finished device from multiple material if our component fail to meet these standard or fail to adapt to evolving standard our reputation competitive advantage and market share could be harmed in certain situation we may undertake voluntary recall of product or temporarily shut production line based on performance relative to our own internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data further we have elected to self insure with respect to product liability risk and any product liability claim brought against with or without merit could be costly to defend and resolve see our insurance program may not be adequate to cover future loss any of the foregoing problem including product liability claim or product recall in the future regardless of their ultimate outcome could harm our reputation and have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow health care policy change including health care reform legislation may have material adverse effect on in response to perceived increase in health care cost in recent year there have been and continue to be proposal by the federal government state government regulator and third party payer to control these cost and more generally to reform the health care system certain of these proposal could limit the price we are able to charge for our product or the amount of reimbursement available for our product and could limit the acceptance and availability of our product the adoption of some or all of these proposal could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation the patient protection and affordable care act the aca and the health care and education affordability reconciliation act of together the law or the legislation provide for number of healthcare policy change that are or will be applicable to however there are many program and requirement under the law for which the consequence are not fully understood and it is unclear the full impact will ultimately be from the law the legislation provides for significant new tax on medical device maker in the form of percent excise tax on all medical device sale that commenced in january although the excise tax ha been suspended by congress until the end of it status is unclear for and subsequent year under the legislation the total cost to the medical device industry is expected to be approximately billion over year the law also focus on number of medicare provision aimed at improving quality and decreasing cost it is uncertain at this point what negative unintended consequence these provision will have on patient access to new technology the medicare provision include value based payment program increased funding of comparative effectiveness research reduced hospital payment for avoidable readmission and hospital acquired condition and pilot program to evaluate alternative payment methodology that promote care coordination such bundled physician and hospital payment additionally the law includes reduction in the annual rate of inflation for medicare payment to hospital that began in and the establishment of an independent payment advisory board to recommend way of reducing the rate of growth in medicare spending currently the congress is considering legislation to repeal and replace the aca we can not predict whether the aca will be repealed replaced or modified or such repeal replacement or modification may be timed or structured result we can not quantify or predict the effect of such repeal replacement or modification might have on our business and result of operation however any change that lower reimbursement for our product or reduce medical procedure volume could adversely affect our business and result of operation of contentsour insurance program may not be adequate to cover future loss we have elected to self insure most of our insurable risk across the company and we made this decision based on cost and availability factor in the insurance marketplace we manage and maintain portion of our self insured program through wholly owned captive insurance company we continue to maintain director and officer liability insurance policy with third party insurer that provides coverage for the director and officer of the company we continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value of obtaining insurance coverage for other category of loss in the future although we believe based on historical loss trend that our self insurance program accrual and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future loss historical trend may not be indicative of future loss the absence of third party insurance coverage for other category of loss increase our exposure to unanticipated claim and these loss could have material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings financial condition and or cash flow if we experience decreasing price for our good and service and we are unable to reduce our expense our result of operation will suffer we may experience decreasing price for our good and service due to pricing pressure experienced by our customer from managed care organization and other third party payer increased market power of our customer the medical device industry consolidates and increased competition among medical engineering and manufacturing service provider if the price for our good and service decrease and we are unable to reduce our expense our result of operation will be adversely affected we may experience higher cost to produce our product result of change in price for oil gas and other commodity we use resin other petroleum based material and pulp raw material in some of our product price of oil and gas also significantly affect our cost for freight and utility oil gas and pulp price are volatile and may increase resulting in higher cost to produce and distribute our product new law or regulation adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy cost and the cost of certain raw material and component due to the highly competitive nature of the healthcare industry and the cost containment effort of our customer and third party payer we may be unable to pas along cost increase through higher price if we are unable to fully recover these cost through price increase or offset these increase through cost reduction we could experience lower margin and profitability and our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected economic and political instability around the world could adversely affect our revenue financial condition or result of operation there can be no assurance that economic and political instability around the world will not adversely affect our revenue financial condition or result of operation our customer and vendor may experience financial difficulty or be unable to borrow money to fund their operation which may adversely impact their ability to purchase our product or to pay for our product on timely basis if at all with our customer and vendor these economic condition make it more difficult for to accurately forecast and plan our future business activity in addition significant amount of our trade receivables are with national health care system in many country repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the political and financial stability of those country in light of these global economic fluctuation we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of customer located outside the failure to receive payment of all or significant portion of these receivables could adversely affect our result of operation we are subject to variety of market and financial risk due to our international operation that could adversely affect those operation or our profitability and operating result although our stock is traded on the new york stock exchange we are global company operation in country outside of the which account for approximately percent of our net sale for fiscal year are accompanied by certain financial and other risk that would not be faced by company operating purely within the we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunity in sale outside the especially in emerging market which could expose to greater risk associated with international sale and operation our profitability and international operation are and will continue to be subject to number of risk and potential cost including fluctuation in currency exchange rate healthcare reform legislation multiple non regulatory requirement that are subject to change and that could restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our product local product preference and product requirement longer term receivables than are typical in the trade protection measure tariff and other border tax and import or export licensing requirement le intellectual property protection in some country outside the than exists in the of content different labor regulation and workforce instability political instability the potential payment of income tax on earnings of certain controlled foreign subsidiary subject to taxation upon repatriation the expiration and non renewal of foreign tax ruling and or grant potentially negative consequence from change in or interpretation of tax law and economic instability and inflation recession or interest rate fluctuation there are recent legislative proposal to tax profit of affiliate which are earned abroad while it is impossible for to predict whether these and other proposal will be implemented or how they will ultimately impact they may materially impact our result of operation if for example our profit earned abroad are subject to income tax or we are otherwise disallowed deduction result of these profit on june the united kingdom held referendum in which voter approved an exit from the commonly referred to brexit result of the referendum it is expected that the british government will begin negotiating the term of the future relationship with the although it is unknown what those term will be it is possible that there will be greater restriction on import and export between the and country and increased regulatory complexity similarly from time to time proposal are made in the to significantly change existing trade agreement and relationship between the and other country although we can not currently predict whether or how these change will be implemented change to trade policy may adversely affect our operation and financial result finally change in currency exchange rate may reduce the reported value of our revenue outside the net of expense and cash flow we can not predict change in currency exchange rate the impact of exchange rate change nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate change the failure to comply with foreign corrupt practice act and similar anti bribery law in non jurisdiction could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil and or criminal sanction the foreign corrupt practice act fcpa and similar anti bribery law in non jurisdiction generally prohibit company and their intermediary from making improper payment to non government official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business because of the predominance of government sponsored healthcare system around the world many of our customer relationship outside of the are with governmental entity and are therefore potentially subject to such law global enforcement of anti corruption law ha increased substantially in recent year with more frequent voluntary self disclosure by company aggressive investigation and enforcement proceeding by and non governmental agency and assessment of significant fine and penalty against company and individual our international operation create the risk of unauthorized payment or offer of payment by one of our employee consultant sale agent or distributor because these party are not always subject to our control it is our policy to implement safeguard to educate our employee and agent on these legal requirement and prohibit improper practice however our existing safeguard and any future improvement may not always be effective and our employee consultant sale agent or distributor may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible in addition the government may seek to hold liable for successor liability fcpa violation committed by any company in which we invest or that we acquire any alleged or actual violation of these regulation may subject to government scrutiny severe criminal or civil sanction and other liability including exclusion from government contracting and could disrupt our business and result in material adverse effect on our reputation result of operation financial condition and cash flow law and regulation governing the export of our product could adversely impact our business the department of the treasury office of foreign asset control ofac and the bureau of industry and security at the department of commerce bi administer certain law and regulation that restrict person and in some instance non person in conducting activity transacting business with or making investment in certain country government entity and individual subject to economic sanction due to our international operation we are subject to such law and regulation which are complex restrict our business dealing with certain country and individual and are constantly changing further restriction may be enacted amended enforced or interpreted in manner that materially impact our operation from time to time certain of our subsidiary have limited business dealing in country subject to comprehensive sanction including iran sudan syria cuba and those in the region of crimea certain of our subsidiary sell medical device and surgical tool and may provide related service to distributor and other purchasing body in such country these business dealing represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenue and income but expose to heightened risk of violating applicable sanction regulation violation of these regulation are punishable by civil penalty including fine denial of export privilege injunction asset seizure debarment from government contract and revocation or restriction of license well criminal fine and imprisonment we have established policy and procedure designed to assist with our compliance with such law and regulation however there can be no assurance that our policy and procedure will effectively prevent from violating these of contentsregulations in every transaction in which we may engage and such violation could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition result of operation and cash flow consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenue and result of operation in response to variety of action by legislator regulator and third party payer to reduce the perceived rise in healthcare cost many health care industry company including health care system are consolidating to create new company with greater market power the health care industry consolidates competition to provide good and service to industry participant will become more intense these industry participant may try to use their market power to negotiate price concession or reduction for medical device that incorporate component produced by if we are forced to reduce our price because of consolidation in the health care industry our revenue would decrease and our consolidated earnings financial condition and or cash flow would suffer our business is indirectly subject to health care industry cost containment measure that could result in reduced sale of medical device and medical device containing our component most of our customer and the health care provider to our customer supply medical device rely on third party payer including government program and private health insurance plan to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedure in which medical device that incorporate component we manufacture or assemble are used the continuing effort of governmental authority insurance company and other payer of health care cost to contain or reduce these cost could lead to patient being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third party payer if third party payer payment approval can not be obtained by patient sale of finished medical device that include our component may decline significantly and our customer may reduce or eliminate purchase of our component the cost containment measure that health care provider are instituting both in the and outside of the could harm our ability to operate profitably for example managed care organization have successfully negotiated volume discount for pharmaceutical in an effort to reduce cost many existing and potential customer for our product within the have become member of gpo and idns gpo and idns negotiate pricing arrangement with healthcare product manufacturer and distributor and offer the negotiated price to affiliated hospital and other member gpo and idns typically award contract on category by category basis through competitive bidding process bid are generally solicited from multiple manufacturer with the intention of driving down pricing due to the highly competitive nature of the gpo and idn contracting process we may not be able to obtain or maintain contract position with major gpo and idns across our product portfolio furthermore the increasing leverage of organized buying group may reduce market price for our product thereby reducing our profitability while contract with gpo and idn for given product category can facilitate sale to member of that gpo or idn such contract position can offer no assurance that sale volume of those product will be maintained gpo and idns increasingly are awarding contract to multiple supplier for the same product category even when we are the sole contracted supplier of gpo or idn for certain product category member of the gpo or idn generally are free to purchase from other supplier furthermore gpo and idn contract typically are terminable without cause upon to day notice accordingly although we have multiple contract with many major gpo and idns the member of such group may choose to purchase from our competitor due to the price or quality offered by such competitor which could result in decline in our sale and profitability our research and development effort rely upon investment and investment collaboration and we can not guarantee that any previous or future investment or investment collaboration will be successful our strategy to provide broad range of therapy to restore patient to fuller healthier life requires wide variety of technology product and capability the rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different area of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop broad portfolio of technological solution in addition to internally generated growth through our research and development effort historically we have relied and expect to continue to rely upon investment and investment collaboration to provide access to new technology both in area served by our existing business well in new area we expect to make future investment where we believe that we can stimulate the development or acquisition of new technology and product to further our strategic objective and strengthen our existing business investment and investment collaboration in and with medical technology company are inherently risky and we can not guarantee that any of our previous or future investment or investment collaboration will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our consolidated earnings financial condition and or cash flow of contentsthe continuing development of many of our product depends upon maintaining strong relationship with health care professional if we fail to maintain our working relationship with health care professional many of our product may not be developed and marketed in line with the need and expectation of the professional who use and support our product which could cause decline in our earnings and profitability the research development marketing and sale of many of our new and improved product is dependent upon our maintaining working relationship with health care professional we rely on these professional to provide with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development marketing and sale of our product physician assist researcher marketing and product consultant inventor and public speaker if we are unable to maintain our strong relationship with these professional and continue to receive their advice and input the development and marketing of our product could suffer which could have material adverse effect on our consolidated earnings financial condition and or cash flow cyber attack or other disruption to our information technology system could lead to reduced revenue increased cost liability claim or harm to our competitive position we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology system to operate our business and many of our product and service include integrated software and information technology we rely on information technology system to collect and process customer order manage product manufacturing and shipping and support regulatory compliance and we routinely process store and transmit large amount of data including sensitive personal information protected health information and business information many of our product and service incorporate software and information technology that allow patient and physician to be connected and collect data regarding patient and the therapy he or she is receiving or that otherwise allow the product or service to operate intended we could experience and in the past have experienced attempted or actual interference with the integrity of and interruption in our technology system well data breach we could also experience attempted or actual interference with the integrity of our product and data these incident could materially harm our business and our reputation is the case with other large enterprise the size and complexity of our product service and information technology system can make them vulnerable to cyber attack breakdown interruption destruction loss or compromise of data obsolescence or incompatibility among system or other significant disruption unauthorized person may attempt to inappropriately access our product or system in order to disrupt disable or degrade such product or service or to obtain proprietary or confidential information such unauthorized access or interference with our product or service could create issue with product functionality which could pose risk to patient safety and risk of product recall or field activity we have program process and technology in place to prevent detect contain respond to and mitigate security related threat and potential incident we undertake considerable ongoing improvement to our system connected device and information sharing product in order to minimize vulnerability in accordance with industry and regulatory standard because the technique used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and can be difficult to detect anticipating identifying or preventing these intrusion or mitigating them if and when they occur may be challenging we also rely on third party vendor to supply and or support certain aspect of our information technology system third party system may contain defect in design or manufacture or other problem that could result in system disruption or unexpectedly compromise the information security of our own system and we are dependent on these third party to provide reliable system and software and to deploy appropriate security program to protect their system in addition we continue to grow in part through new business acquisition result of acquisition we may face risk due to implementation modification or remediation of control procedure and policy relating to data privacy and cybersecurity at the acquired company we continue to consolidate and integrate the number of system we operate and to upgrade and expand our information system capability for stable and secure business operation if we are unable to maintain reliable information technology system and prevent disruption outage or data breach we may suffer regulatory consequence in addition to business consequence our worldwide operation mean that we are subject to law and regulation including data protection and cyber security law and regulation in many jurisdiction the variety of and international privacy and cybersecurity law and regulation impacting our operation are described in item business other factor impacting our operation data privacy and cybersecurity law and regulation we have program to ensure compliance with such law and regulation however there is no guarantee that we will avoid enforcement action by governmental body enforcement action may be costly and interrupt regular operation of our business in addition there ha been developing trend of civil lawsuit and class action relating to breach of consumer data held by large company or incident arising from other cyber attack while medtronic ha not been named in any such suit if substantial breach or loss of data were to occur we could become target of such litigation of contentsour information technology system require an ongoing commitment of significant resource to maintain protect and enhance existing system and develop new system to keep pace with continuing change in information processing technology evolving legal and regulatory standard the increasing need to protect patient and customer information and the information technology need associated with our changing product and service there can be no assurance that our process of consolidating protecting upgrading and expanding our system and capability continuing to build security into the design of our product and developing new system to keep pace with continuing change in information processing technology will be successful or that additional system issue will not arise in the future any significant breakdown intrusion interruption corruption or destruction of these system well any data breach could have material adverse effect on our business if our information technology system product or service or sensitive data are compromised patient or employee could be exposed to financial or medical identity theft or suffer loss of product functionality and we could lose existing customer have difficulty attracting new customer have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud be exposed to the loss or misuse of confidential information have dispute with customer physician and other health care professional suffer regulatory sanction or penalty under federal law state law or the law of other jurisdiction experience increase in operating expense or an impairment in our ability to conduct our operation incur expense or lose revenue result of data privacy breach product failure information technology outage or disruption or suffer other adverse consequence including lawsuit or other legal action and damage to our reputation negative condition in global credit market may impair our ability to issue debt security and impact the liquidity and or market value of investment in marketable debt security which may cause loss and liquidity issue we have investment in marketable debt security that are classified and accounted for available for sale our debt security include government and agency security corporate debt security certificate of deposit debt fund and mortgage backed and other asset backed security market condition over the past several year have included period of significant economic uncertainty and at time general market distress during these period we may experience reduced liquidity across the fixed income investment market including the security in which we invest in the event we need to sell these security we may not be able to do in timely manner or for value that is equal to the underlying principal in addition we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the security and record an impairment charge if we determine that the fair value of such security is temporarily impaired we would record temporary impairment component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income within shareholder equity if it is determined that the fair value of these security is other than temporarily impaired we would record loss in our consolidated statement of earnings which could materially adversely impact our result of operation and financial condition negative market condition may also impair our ability to access the capital market through the issuance of commercial paper or other debt security or may negatively impact our ability to borrow from financial institution our product are continually the subject of clinical trial conducted by our competitor or other third party the result of which may be unfavorable or perceived unfavorable and could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new product and new indication for existing product we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trial with variety of study design patient population and trial endpoint unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trial conducted by by our competitor or by third party or the market or fda perception of this clinical data may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approval our position in and share of the market in which we participate and our business financial condition and result of operation failure to integrate acquired business into our operation successfully could adversely affect our business part of our strategy to develop and identify new product and technology we have made several acquisition in recent year including the acquisition of covidien and may make additional acquisition in the future our integration of the operation of acquired business requires significant effort including the coordination of information technology research and development sale and marketing operation manufacturing and finance these effort result in additional expense and involve significant amount of management time that can not then be dedicated to other project our failure to manage and coordinate the growth of the combined company successfully could also have an adverse impact on our business in addition we can not be certain that the business we acquire will become profitable or remain so factor that will affect the success of our acquisition include the presence or absence of adequate internal control and or significant fraud in the financial system of acquired company our ability or inability to integrate information technology system of acquired company in secure and reliable manner adverse development arising of investigation by governmental entity of the business practice of acquired company including potential liability imposed by fcpa of content any decrease in customer loyalty and product order caused by dissatisfaction with the combined company product line and sale and marketing practice including price increase our ability to retain key employee and the ability of the combined company to achieve synergy among it constituent company such increasing sale of the combined company product achieving cost saving and effectively combining technology to develop new product we also could experience negative effect on our result of operation cash flow and financial condition from acquisition related charge amortization of intangible asset and asset impairment charge these effect individually or in the aggregate could cause deterioration of our credit rating and result in increased borrowing cost and interest expense we may not complete the planned disposition of the patient care deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency business within the patient monitoring recovery division of our minimally invasive therapy group on the anticipated timeline or at all and even if completed we may not achieve the benefit we anticipate in april we announced that we had entered into definitive agreement to sell the patient care deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency business within the patient monitoring recovery division of our minimally invasive therapy group to cardinal health inc for billion in cash subject to certain adjustment with total after tax proceeds estimated to be approximately billion we expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of our fiscal year subject to satisfaction of customary closing condition in connection with the transaction we announced that we anticipate number of benefit from the disposition including improvement in our revenue growth rate and operating margin lower debt leverage ratio and an increased ability to fund potential investment in higher growth and higher margin opportunity the disposition transaction is complex in nature subject to various condition and may be adversely affected by unanticipated development and unexpected change in market or other condition if any closing condition are not met the closing of the disposition transaction may be delayed or fail to occur and we may not achieve the intended benefit we anticipate moreover if the disposition is not completed on the anticipated timeline or at all our ongoing operation of the patient monitoring recovery division may be harmed even if the disposition transaction is completed we may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefit including the financial and operational benefit described above and our future investment and other business opportunity that we anticipate will be facilitated by the disposition may not be successful and may prove not to be superior alternative to the continued operation of our current patient monitoring recovery division further execution of the proposed disposition will require significant time and attention from management and other employee including following the closing of the disposition transaction which may divert the attention of our management and other employee from the execution of our other initiative and could affect our financial condition result of operation or cash flow the expansion of our service and solution business may not yield the revenue we expect and will expose to new risk we are increasingly focusing on our service and solution business and the creation of comprehensive value based healthcare offering in which payment is based on measurable patient outcome over specific time horizon these offering include care management service cath lab and operating room managed service and solution for chronic disease management we intend to expand our service and solution model across all of our business group and across geographic region however we remain in the relatively early stage of developing and implementing this business model result we will need to invest significant expense and management resource into developing our expertise and executing our strategy and our effort may not be profitable in addition the expansion of our service and solution business model will expose to or increase our exposure to variety of regulation in the various country we provide service and solution including regulation related to government payment fraud and abuse patient privacy and the corporate practice of medicine compliance with these regulation may prove to be more costly than we anticipate and we may not successfully comply with such regulation these regulatory cost may slow our expansion into these business area and may have negative effect on our result of operation cash flow and financial condition the medical device industry is the subject of numerous governmental investigation into marketing and other business practice these investigation could result in the commencement of civil and or criminal proceeding substantial fine penalty and or administrative remedy divert the attention of our management and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation we are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and non governmental authority these authority have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry we occasionally receive subpoena or other request for information from state and federal governmental agency including among others the department of justice and the office of contentsof inspector general of hhs these investigation typically relate primarily to financial arrangement with health care provider regulatory compliance and product promotional practice we cooperate with these investigation and respond to such request however when an investigation begin we can not predict when it will be resolved the outcome of the investigation or it impact on an adverse outcome in one or more of these investigation could include the commencement of civil and or criminal proceeding substantial fine penalty and or administrative remedy including exclusion from government reimbursement program entry into corporate integrity agreement cia with governmental agency and amendment to existing cia in addition resolution of any of these matter could involve the imposition of additional and costly compliance obligation finally if these investigation continue over long period of time they could divert the attention of management from the day to day operation of our business and impose significant administrative burden including cost on these potential consequence well any adverse outcome from these investigation or other investigation initiated by government at any time could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation our substantial leverage and debt service obligation could adversely affect our business at april our total consolidated external debt wa approximately billion we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequence including making it more difficult for to satisfy our financial obligation increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic regulatory and industry condition and placing at disadvantage compared to our competitor that are le leveraged limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for or reacting to change in our business and the industry in which we operate limiting our ability to borrow additional fund for working capital capital expenditure acquisition and general corporate or other purpose and exposing to greater interest rate risk since the interest rate on borrowing under our floating rate note and revolving credit facility is variable our debt service obligation will require to use portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness instead of for other corporate purpose including funding future expansion of our business acquisition and ongoing capital expenditure which could impede our growth if our operating cash flow and capital resource are insufficient to service our debt obligation we may be forced to sell asset seek additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt which could harm our long term business prospect our failure to comply with the term of our revolving credit facility and other indebtedness could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt our ability to generate cash in the future is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factor many of which are beyond our control change in tax law or exposure to additional income tax liability could have material impact on our financial condition and result of operation we are subject to income tax well non income based tax in both the and various jurisdiction outside the we are subject to ongoing tax audit in various jurisdiction tax authority may disagree with certain position we have taken and ass additional tax we regularly ass the likely outcome of these audit in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcome of these audit and the actual outcome of these audit could have material impact on our consolidated earnings and financial condition additionally change in tax law or tax ruling could materially impact our effective tax rate for example legislation in imposed percent excise tax on medical device manufacturer for sale of medical device beginning in january proposal for fundamental corporate tax reform if enacted could have material impact on our financial condition and result of operation of contentsmedtronic inc tax court proceeding outcome could have material adverse impact on our financial condition in march the irs issued it audit report for medtronic inc for fiscal year and medtronic inc reached agreement with the irs on some but not all matter related to these fiscal year on december the irs issued statutory notice of deficiency with respect to the remaining issue medtronic inc filed petition with the tax court on march objecting to the deficiency during october and november medtronic inc reached resolution with the irs on various matter including the deductibility of settlement payment medtronic inc and the irs agreed to hold one issue the calculation of amount eligible for the one time repatriation holiday because that issue wa being addressed by other taxpayer in litigation with the irs the remaining unresolved issue for fiscal year and relates to the allocation of income between medtronic inc and it wholly owned subsidiary operating in puerto rico which is one of the company key manufacturing site the tax court proceeding with respect to this issue began on february and ended on march on june the tax court issued it opinion with respect to the allocation of income between medtronic inc and it wholly owned subsidiary operating in puerto rico for fiscal year and the tax court generally rejected the irs position but also made certain modification to the medtronic inc tax return filed during november medtronic and the irs entered into stipulation of settled issue with the tax court which resolved the one time repatriation holiday an outstanding issue unless either party decided to appeal the tax court opinion and final decision is inconsistent with the tax court opinion the tax court entered their final decision on january on april the irs filed their notice of appeal to the court of appeal for the circuit regarding the tax court opinion hearing date for the appeal ha not been set decision by the circuit court of appeal overturning the tax court opinion could have material adverse impact on our financial condition examination and audit by tax authority could result in additional tax payment which could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow the company ha provided reserve for potential payment of tax to various tax authority related to uncertain tax position however the calculation of such tax liability involves the application of complex tax regulation in many jurisdiction therefore any dispute with tax authority may result in payment that is significantly different from current estimate if payment of these amount ultimately prof to be le than the recorded amount the reversal of the liability generally would result in tax benefit being recognized in the period when we determine the liability are no longer necessary if the company estimate of tax liability prof to be le than the amount for which it is ultimately liable we would incur additional charge to expense and such charge could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow if the distribution of mallinckrodt ordinary share to covidien shareholder in or certain internal transaction undertaken in anticipation of the separation are determined to be taxable for federal income tax purpose we could incur significant federal income tax liability covidien received an irs ruling substantially to the effect that for federal income tax purpose certain transaction effected in connection with it separation of mallinckrodt qualify transaction under section and or of the code and ii the distribution qualifies transaction under section and of the code in addition to obtaining the irs ruling covidien received tax opinion from skadden arp slate meagher flom llp in form and substance acceptable to covidien which relied on the effectiveness of the irs ruling substantially to the effect that for federal income tax purpose the distribution and certain transaction entered into in connection with the distribution qualify transaction under section and or of the code the private letter ruling and the opinion relied on certain fact and assumption and certain representation and undertaking in the case of the separation from covidien and mallinckrodt regarding the past and future conduct of their respective business and other matter notwithstanding the private letter ruling and the tax opinion the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the related internal transaction should be treated taxable transaction if it determines that any of the respective fact assumption representation or undertaking is not correct or ha been violated or that the distribution should be taxable for other reason including result of significant change in stock or asset ownership after the distribution or if the irs were to disagree with the conclusion of the tax opinion that are not covered by the irs ruling we could incur significant federal income tax liability or tax indemnification obligation whether under applicable law or the tax matter agreement that wa entered into with mallinckrodt if it is ultimately determined that certain related transaction undertaken in anticipation of the distribution are taxable our tax position may be adversely affected by change in tax law relating to multinational corporation recent legislative proposal have aimed to expand the scope of corporate tax residence limit the ability of foreign owned corporation to deduct interest expense tax the accumulated unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiary of corporation impose minimum tax on the future offshore earnings of multinational group and to make other change in the taxation of multinational corporation of contentsadditionally the congress government agency in non jurisdiction where we and our affiliate do business and the organisation for economic co operation and development have recently focused on issue related to the taxation of multinational corporation one example is in the area of base erosion and profit shifting where profit are claimed to be earned for tax purpose in low tax jurisdiction or payment are made between affiliate from jurisdiction with high tax rate to jurisdiction with lower tax rate the organisation for economic co operation and development ha released several component of it comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rule for fighting base erosion and profit shifting result the tax law in the ireland and other country in which we and our affiliate do business could change on prospective or retroactive basis and any such change could materially adversely affect our business moreover tax authority may carefully scrutinize company that result from cross border business combination such which may lead such authority to assert that we owe additional tax which could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow risk relating to our jurisdiction of incorporationirish law differs from the law in effect in the and may afford le protection to holder of our security it may not be possible to enforce court judgment obtained in the against in ireland based on the civil liability provision of the federal or state security law in addition there is some uncertainty to whether the court of ireland would recognize or enforce judgment of court obtained against or our director or officer based on the civil liability provision of the federal or state security law or hear action against or those person based on those law we have been advised that the currently doe not have treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgment in civil and commercial matter therefore final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on federal or state security law would not automatically be enforceable in ireland an irish company we are governed by the irish company act which differs in some material respect from law generally applicable to corporation and shareholder including among others difference relating to interested director and officer transaction and shareholder lawsuit likewise the duty of director and officer of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholder of irish company generally do not have personal right of action against director or officer of the company and may exercise such right of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstance accordingly holder of our security may have more difficulty protecting their interest than would holder of security of corporation incorporated in jurisdiction of the an irish public limited company certain capital structure decision require shareholder approval which may limit medtronic flexibility to manage it capital structure under irish law our authorized share capital can be increased by an ordinary resolution of our shareholder and the director may issue new ordinary or preferred share up to maximum amount equal to the authorized but unissued share capital without shareholder approval once authorized to do so by our article of association or by an ordinary resolution of our shareholder additionally subject to specified exception irish law grant statutory preemption right to existing shareholder where share are being issued for cash consideration but allows shareholder to disapply such statutory preemption right either in our article of association or by way of special resolution such disapplication can either be generally applicable or be in respect of particular allotment of share accordingly our article of association contain permitted by irish company law provision authorizing the board to issue new share and to disapply statutory preemption right the authorization of the director to issue share and the disapplication of statutory preemption right must both be renewed by the shareholder at least every five year and we can not provide any assurance that these authorization will always be approved which could limit our ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect the holder of our security transfer of our share other than one effected by mean of the transfer of book entry interest in the depository trust company may be subject to irish stamp duty transfer of our share effected by mean of the transfer of book entry interest in the depository trust company dtc will not be subject to irish stamp duty however if you hold our share directly rather than beneficially through dtc any transfer of your share could be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the share acquired payment of irish stamp duty is generally legal obligation of the transferee the potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of your share of contentsin certain limited circumstance dividend we pay may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax and dividend received by irish resident and certain other shareholder may be subject to irish income tax in certain limited circumstance dividend withholding tax currently at rate of may arise in respect of dividend paid on our share number of exemption from dividend withholding tax exist such that shareholder resident in the and other specified country may be entitled to exemption from dividend withholding tax shareholder resident in the that hold their share through dtc will not be subject to dividend withholding tax provided the address of the beneficial owner of such share in the record of the broker holding such share are recorded being in the and such broker have further transmitted the relevant information to qualifying intermediary appointed by however other shareholder may be subject to dividend withholding tax which could adversely affect the price of their share shareholder entitled to an exemption from irish dividend withholding tax on dividend received from will not be subject to irish income tax in respect of those dividend unless they have some connection with ireland other than their shareholding in our company for example they are resident in ireland shareholder who receive dividend subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on those dividend our share received by mean of gift or inheritance could be subject to irish capital acquisition tax irish capital acquisition tax cat could apply to gift or inheritance of our share irrespective of the place of residence ordinary residence or domicile of the party this is because our share will be regarded property situated in ireland the person who receives the gift or inheritance ha primary liability for cat gift and inheritance passing between spouse are exempt from cat child have tax free threshold which irish revenue typically update annually in respect of taxable gift or inheritance received from their parent risk relating to the covidien acquisition the transaction we may not realize all of the anticipated benefit of the transaction or those benefit may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulty in integrating medtronic inc and covidien our ability to realize the anticipated benefit of the transaction will depend to large extent on our ability to integrate the medtronic inc and covidien business the combination of two independent business is complex costly and time consuming process result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resource to integrating the business practice and operation of medtronic inc and covidien the integration process may disrupt the business and if implemented ineffectively or if impacted by unforeseen negative economic or market condition or other factor we may not realize the full anticipated benefit of the transaction our failure to meet the challenge involved in integrating the two business to realize the anticipated benefit of the transaction could cause an interruption or loss of momentum in our activity and could adversely affect our result of operation in addition the overall integration of the business may result in material unanticipated problem expense liability competitive response loss of customer relationship and diversion of management attention the difficulty of combining the operation of the company include among others the diversion of management attention to integration matter difficulty in achieving anticipated cost saving synergy business opportunity and growth prospect from combining the business difficulty in the integration of operation and system difficulty in the assimilation of employee difficulty in managing the expanded operation of significantly larger and more complex company challenge in keeping existing customer and obtaining new customer and challenge in attracting and retaining key personnel many of these factor will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased cost decrease in the amount of expected revenue and diversion of management time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and result of operation in addition even if the operation of the business of medtronic inc and covidien are integrated successfully we may not realize the full benefit of the transaction including the synergy cost saving or sale or growth opportunity that we expect these benefit may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all furthermore additional unanticipated cost may be incurred in the integration of the business of medtronic inc and covidien all of these factor could negatively impact our earnings per share decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transaction and negatively impact the price of our ordinary share result we can not assure you that the combination of the medtronic inc and covidien business will result in the realization of the full benefit anticipated from the transaction of contentsfuture potential change to the tax law could result in being treated corporation for federal tax purpose and the irs may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated foreign corporation for federal income tax purpose because we are an irish incorporated entity we would generally be classified foreign corporation under the general rule that corporation is considered tax resident in the jurisdiction of it organization or incorporation for federal income tax purpose even so the irs may assert that we should be treated corporation and therefore tax resident for federal income tax purpose pursuant to section of the internal revenue code of amended the code under section of the code if medtronic inc shareholder immediately prior to the transaction hold or more of the vote or value of our share by reason of holding stock in medtronic inc immediately after the transaction the ownership test and our expanded affiliated group after the transaction doe not have substantial business activity in ireland relative to it worldwide activity the substantial business activity test we would be treated corporation for federal income tax purpose based on the rule for determining share ownership under section of the code medtronic inc shareholder received approximately of our ordinary share by both vote and value by reason of holding stock in medtronic inc therefore under current law we should not be treated corporation for federal income tax purpose however there is limited guidance regarding the application of section including the application of the ownership test in addition change to section or the treasury regulation promulgated thereunder could affect our status foreign corporation for federal tax purpose any such change could have prospective or retroactive application since section wa enacted there have been various legislative proposal to broaden it scope such proposal could among other thing treat foreign acquiring corporation corporation under section if the former shareholder of the corporation own more than of the share of the foreign acquiring corporation after the transaction or if the foreign corporation affiliated group ha substantial business activity in the and the foreign corporation is primarily managed and controlled in the accordingly if enacted in their present form and retroactively effective to apply to the transaction such proposal could cause to be treated corporation for federal tax purpose if we were to be treated corporation for federal tax purpose based on our existing expected cash flow we could be subject to substantially greater tax liability than currently contemplated non corporation specifically if we were to be treated corporation for federal tax purpose we would be subject to corporate income tax on our worldwide income and the income of our foreign subsidiary would be subject to tax when repatriated or when deemed recognized under the tax rule for controlled foreign corporation cfc additionally covidien foreign corporation which are not currently cfc would become cfc making them potentially subject to current or future taxation which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and cash flow the treasury department and the irs may promulgate rule that would adversely affect our tax position the treasury department could make change in the regulatory rule affecting company that move their tax domicile outside the in the event the treasury department and the irs were to change the applicable regulatory rule we could face potentially substantial tax cost result of the transaction we can not ass the potential impact of any such possible change if adopted until they are announced on april the treasury department and the irs issued proposed and temporary regulation interpreting multiple section of the code including section to address inversion transaction and transaction that treasury and the irs characterize post inversion tax avoidance transaction such regulation generally apply to transaction completed on or after september although in some case they have later effective date of april the regulation expand the set of circumstance under which section applies to cause the foreign acquirer of corporation to be treated corporation for federal income tax purpose such regulation also impose additional tax on certain transaction involving the acquired corporation cfc the regulation do not cause to be treated corporation for federal tax purpose however if ultimately upheld by reviewing court the regulation limit our ability to engage in various intercompany transaction involving non subsidiary in addition the treasury department and the irs issued final and temporary regulation on october which might limit our ability to deduct interest expense on certain intercompany debt for federal income tax purpose of contentsthe transaction may not allow to maintain competitive global cash management and competitive effective corporate tax rate while we believe that being incorporated in ireland should help maintain competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate and provide flexible global cash management we are unable to give any assurance to what our effective tax rate nor global cash accessibility will be however because of among other thing uncertainty regarding the tax policy of the jurisdiction where we will operate additionally the tax law of ireland and other jurisdiction could change in the future and such change could cause material change in our effective tax rate or global cash accessibility legislative or other governmental action relating to the denial of federal or state governmental contract to company that redomicile abroad could adversely affect our business various federal and state legislative proposal that would deny governmental contract to company that move their corporate location abroad may affect we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of the regulation that may be promulgated under any future

realization of over million in synergy saving since the acquisition of covidien coupled with our revenue growth critical accounting estimateswe have used various accounting policy to prepare the consolidated financial statement in accordance with gaap our most significant accounting policy are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statement in item financial statement and supplementary data in this annual report on form the preparation of the consolidated financial statement in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in making estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense these estimate reflect management best judgment about economic and market condition and the potential effect on the valuation and or carrying value of asset and liability based upon relevant information available we base our estimate on historical experience and on various assumption that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily apparent from other source our critical accounting estimate include the following revenue recognition rebate are estimated based on sale term historical experience and trend analysis in estimating rebate we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the rebate claim contractual commitment including stated rebate rate and other relevant information we adjust reserve to reflect difference between estimated and actual experience and recognize such adjustment reduction of sale in the period of adjustment adjustment to recorded reserve have not been significant price adjustment rebate charged against gross sale were billion and billion in fiscal year and respectively and million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year litigation contingency we are involved in number of legal action involving product liability intellectual property dispute shareholder related matter environmental proceeding income tax dispute and governmental proceeding and investigation in the and around the world the outcome of these legal action are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged period of time in some action the enforcement agency or private claimant seek damage well other civil or criminal remedy including injunction barring the sale of product that are the subject of the proceeding that could require significant expenditure or result in lost revenue or limit our ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdiction estimate of probable loss resulting from litigation and governmental proceeding involving are inherently difficult to predict particularly when the matter are in early procedural stage with incomplete scientific fact or legal discovery involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claim for damage potentially involve penalty fine or punitive damage or could result in change in business practice our significant legal proceeding are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement in item financial statement and supplementary data in this annual report on form and while it is not possible to predict the outcome for of contentsmost of the matter discussed we believe it is possible that cost associated with these matter could have material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings financial position and or cash flow income tax reserve we establish reserve when despite our belief that our tax return position are fully supportable we believe that certain position are likely to be challenged and that we may or may not prevail under gaap if we determine that tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merit of the position we recognize the benefit we measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon settlement we presume that all tax position will be examined by taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the calculation of our tax liability involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulation in multitude of jurisdiction across our global operation we regularly monitor our tax position and tax liability we reevaluate the technical merit of our tax position and recognize an uncertain tax benefit or derecognize previously recorded tax benefit when there is completion of tax audit ii effective settlement of an issue iii change in applicable tax law including tax case or legislative guidance or iv an expiration of the statute of limitation significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserve although we believe that we have adequately provided for liability resulting from tax assessment by taxing authority position taken by these tax authority could have material impact on our effective tax rate consolidated earnings financial position and or cash flow valuation of intangible asset and goodwill when we acquire business the asset acquired and liability assumed are recorded at their respective fair value at the acquisition date goodwill is the excess

ipr determining the fair value of intangible asset acquired part of business combination requires to make significant estimate these estimate include the amount and timing of projected future cash flow of each project or technology the discount rate used to discount those cash flow to present value the assessment of the asset life cycle and the consideration of legal technical regulatory economic and competitive risk the test for goodwill impairment requires to make several estimate about fair value most of which are based on projected future cash flow our estimate associated with the goodwill impairment test are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value including projected future cash flow we ass the impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstance change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired goodwill wa billion and billion at april and april respectively we test definite lived intangible asset for impairment when an event occurs or circumstance change that would indicate

on both recurring and nonrecurring basis fair value is defined the exit price or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant of the measurement date the authoritative guidance also establishes hierarchy for input used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable input and minimizes the use of unobservable input by requiring that the most observable input be used when available observable input are input market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from source independent of the company unobservable input are input that reflect the company assumption about the factor market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstance the categorization of financial asset and financial liability within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the hierarchy is broken down into three level defined follows level input are quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability

prior to april the company estimated such cost component utilizing single weighted average discount rate derived from the market observed yield curve of high quality fixed income security used to measure the pension benefit obligation and accumulated post retirement benefit obligation the current methodology utilizes full yield curve approach in the estimation of these cost component by applying the specific spot rate along the yield curve to their underlying projected cash flow and provides more precise measurement of service and interest cost by improving the correlation between
