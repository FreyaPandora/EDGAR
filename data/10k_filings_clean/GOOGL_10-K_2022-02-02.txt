display of ad online in many of our advertiser company that distribute our product and service digital publisher and content provider can terminate their contract with at any time these partner may not continue to do business with if we do not create more value such increased number of user or customer new sale lead increased brand awareness or more effective monetization than their available alternative change to our advertising policy and data privacy practice well change to other company advertising and or data privacy practice have in the past and may in the future affect the advertising that we are able to provide which could harm our business in addition technology have been developed that make customized ad more difficult or that block the display of ad altogether and some provider of online service have integrated technology that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third party digital advertising failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisement effectively and competitively could harm our reputation financial condition and operating result in addition expenditure by advertiser tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic condition and budgeting and buying pattern adverse macroeconomic condition have affected and may in the future affect the demand for advertising resulting in fluctuation in the amount our advertiser spend on advertising which could harm our financial condition and operating result we face intense competition if we do not continue to innovate and provide product and service that are useful to user customer and other partner we may not remain competitive which could harm our business and operating result our business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive our business face changing technology shifting user need and frequent introduction of rival product and service to compete successfully we must accurately anticipate technology development and deliver innovative relevant and useful product service and technology in timely manner our business evolve the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass wider range of product and service we must continue to invest significant resource in including through acquisition in order to enhance our technology and new and existing product and service we have many competitor in different industry our current and potential domestic and international competitor range from large and established company to emerging start ups some competitor have longer operating history and well established relationship in various sector they can use their experience and resource in way that could affect our competitive position including by making acquisition continuing to invest heavily in and in talent aggressively initiating intellectual property claim whether or not meritorious and continuing to compete aggressively for user advertiser customer and content provider further discrepancy in enforcement of existing law may enable our lesser known competitor to aggressively interpret those law without commensurate scrutiny thereby affording them competitive advantage our competitor may also be able to innovate and provide product and service faster than we can or may foresee the need for product and service before our operating result may also suffer if our product and service are not responsive to the need of our user advertiser publisher customer and content provider technology continue to develop our competitor may be able to offer experience that are or that are seen to be substantially similar to or better than ours this may force to compete in different way and expend significant resource in order to remain competitive if our competitor are more successful than we are in providing compelling product and service or in attracting and retaining user advertiser publisher customer and content provider our operating result could be harmed our ongoing investment in new business product service and technology is inherently risky and could divert management attention and harm our financial condition and operating result of contentsalphabet inc we have invested and expect to continue to invest in new business product service and technology the investment that we are making across google service google cloud and other bet reflect our ongoing effort to innovate and provide product and service that are useful to user advertiser publisher customer and content provider our investment in google service google cloud and other bet span wide range of industry beyond online advertising such investment ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and in pursuing new strategy we may incur unanticipated liability these endeavor may involve significant risk and uncertainty including diversion of resource and management attention from current operation and with respect to other bet the use of alternative investment governance or compensation structure that may fail to adequately align incentive across the company or otherwise accomplish their objective within google service we continue to invest heavily in hardware including our smartphones home device and wearable which is highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new product and service rapid adoption of technological advancement by competitor short product life cycle evolving industry standard continual improvement in product price and performance characteristic and price and feature sensitivity on the part of consumer and business there can be no assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively within google cloud we devote significant resource to develop and deploy our enterprise ready cloud service including google cloud platform and google workspace we are incurring cost to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing service and hire talent particularly to support and scale our salesforce at the same time our competitor are rapidly developing and deploying cloud based service pricing and delivery model are competitive and evolving and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objective within other bet we are investing significantly in the area of health life science and transportation among others these investment area face intense competition from large experienced and well funded competitor and our offering may not be able to compete effectively or to operate at sufficient level of profitability in addition new and evolving product and service including those that use ai and machine learning raise ethical technological legal regulatory and other challenge which may negatively affect our brand and demand for our product and service because all of these new venture are inherently risky no assurance can be given that such strategy and offering will be successful and will not harm our reputation financial condition and operating result our revenue growth rate could decline over time and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future our revenue growth rate could decline over time result of number of factor including increasing competition change in device mix geographic mix ongoing product and policy change product mix and property mix and an increasing competition for advertising may also affect our advertising revenue growth rate we may also experience decline in our revenue growth rate our revenue increase to higher level if there is decrease in the rate of adoption of our product service and technology or due to deceleration or decline in demand for device used to access our service among other factor in addition we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from variety of factor such the continued expansion of our business into new field including product and service such hardware google cloud and subscription product well significant investment in other bet all of which may have margin lower than those we generate from advertising we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin from increasing regulation increasing competition and increased cost for many aspect of our business due to these factor and the evolving nature of our business our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance for additional information see trend in our business and financial effect in part ii item of this annual report on form our intellectual property right are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our product service and brand well affect our ability to compete our patent trademark trade secret copyright and other intellectual property right are important asset for various event outside of our control pose threat to our intellectual property right well to our product service and technology for example effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our product and service are distributed or made available through the internet also the effort we have taken to protect our proprietary right may not be sufficient or effective although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovation it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovation moreover we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovation that later turn out to be important there is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable of contentsalphabet inc we also seek to maintain certain intellectual property trade secret the secrecy of such trade secret and other sensitive information could be compromised which could cause to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secret we also face risk associated with our trademark for example there is risk that the word google could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word search some court have ruled that google is protectable trademark but it is possible that other court particularly those outside of the may reach different determination if this happens we could lose protection for this trademark which could result in other people using the word google to refer to their own product thus diminishing our brand any significant impairment of our intellectual property right could harm our business and our ability to compete also protecting our intellectual property right is costly and time consuming any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating result our business depends on strong brand and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our base of user advertiser customer content provider and other partner our strong brand have significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing the brand within google service google cloud and other bet increase our ability to enter new category and launch new and innovative product and service that better serve the need of our user advertiser customer content provider and other partner our brand have been and may in the future be negatively affected by number of factor including among others reputational issue third party content shared on our platform data privacy and security issue and development and product or technical performance failure for example if we fail to respond appropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our service and or product or objectionable practice by advertiser or otherwise to adequately address user concern our user may lose confidence in our brand furthermore failure to maintain and enhance equity in our brand may harm our business financial condition and operating result our success will depend largely on our ability to remain technology leader and continue to provide high quality trustworthy innovative product and service that are truly useful and play valuable role in range of setting we face number of manufacturing and supply chain risk that could harm our financial condition operating result and prospect we face number of risk related to manufacturing and supply chain management which could affect our ability to supply both our product and our internet based service we rely on other company to manufacture many of our finished product to design certain of our component and part to participate in the distribution of our product and service and to design manufacture or assemble certain component and part in our technical infrastructure our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these company with the necessary capability or capacity on reasonable term or if those we engage fail to meet their obligation whether due to financial difficulty or other reason or make adverse change in the pricing or other material term of our arrangement with them we have experienced and or may in the future experience supply shortage and or price increase that could negatively affect our operation driven by raw material component or part availability manufacturing capacity labor shortage industry allocation logistics capacity tariff trade dispute and barrier natural disaster or pandemic the effect of climate change such sea level rise drought flooding heat wave wildfire and resultant air quality effect and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention and increased storm severity and significant change in the financial or business condition of our supplier in addition some of the component we use in our technical infrastructure and product are available from only one or limited source and we may not be able to find replacement vendor on favorable term in the event of supply chain disruption in addition significant supply interruption that affect or our vendor could delay critical data center upgrade or expansion and delay product availability we may enter into long term contract for material and product that commit to significant term and condition we may be liable for material and product that are not consumed due to market acceptance technological change obsolescence quality product recall and warranty issue for instance because certain of our hardware supply contract have volume based pricing or minimum purchase requirement if the volume of our hardware sale decrease or doe not reach projected target we could face increased material and manufacturing cost or other financial liability that could make our product more costly per unit to manufacture and negatively affect our financial result furthermore certain of our competitor may negotiate more favorable contractual term based on volume and other commitment that may provide them with competitive advantage and may affect our supply of contentsalphabet inc our product and service have had and in the future may have quality issue resulting from design manufacturing or operation sometimes these issue may be caused by component we purchase from other manufacturer or supplier if the quality of our product and service doe not meet expectation or our product or service are defective it could harm our reputation financial condition and operating result we require our supplier and business partner to comply with law and where applicable our company policy such the google supplier code of conduct regarding workplace and employment practice data security environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing but we do not control them or their practice violation of law or unethical business practice could result in supply chain disruption canceled order harm to key relationship and damage to our reputation their failure to procure necessary license right to

upgrade terrorist attack natural disaster or pandemic the effect of climate change such sea level rise drought flooding heat wave wildfire and resultant air quality effect and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention and increased storm severity power loss telecommunication failure computer virus ransomware attack computer denial of service attack phishing scheme or other attempt to harm or access our system some of our data center are located in area with high risk of major earthquake or other natural disaster our data center are also subject to break in sabotage and intentional act of vandalism and in some case to potential disruption resulting from problem experienced by facility operator some of our system are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning can not account for all eventuality the occurrence of natural disaster or pandemic closure of facility or other unanticipated problem affecting our data center could result in lengthy interruption in our service in addition our product and service are highly technical and complex and have contained in the past and may contain in the future error or vulnerability which could result in interruption in or failure of our service or system in addition we rely extensively on information system and technology to manage our business and summarize operating result we are in the process of multi year implementation of new erp system which is designed to accurately maintain our financial record enhance the flow of financial information improve data management and provide timely information to our management team the phased implementation continues we may experience delay increased cost and other difficulty failure to successfully design and implement the erp system planned could harm our

control over financial reporting could be negatively affected our international operation expose to additional risk that could harm our business our financial condition and operating result our international operation are significant to our revenue and net income and we plan to continue to grow internationally international revenue accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue in in addition to risk described elsewhere in this section our international operation expose to other risk including the following restriction on foreign ownership and investment and stringent foreign exchange control that might prevent from repatriating cash earned in country outside the import and export requirement tariff and other market access barrier that may prevent or impede from offering product or providing service to particular market or that could limit our ability to source assembly and finished product from particular market and may increase our operating cost longer payment cycle in some country increased credit risk and higher level of payment fraud an evolving foreign policy landscape that may adversely affect our revenue and could subject to new regulatory cost and challenge including the transfer of personal data the eu and the united kingdom and new customer requirement in addition to other adverse effect that we are unable to effectively anticipate of contentsalphabet inc anti corruption law such the foreign corrupt practice act and other local law prohibiting certain payment to government official violation of which could result in civil and criminal penalty uncertainty regarding liability for service and content including uncertainty result of local law and lack of legal precedent and different employee employer relationship existence of work council and labor union and other challenge caused by distance language and cultural difference making it harder to do business in certain jurisdiction because we conduct business in currency other than dollar but report our financial result in dollar we have faced and will continue to face exposure to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate although we hedge portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuation in exchange rate between the dollar and foreign currency may adversely affect our revenue and earnings hedging program are also inherently risky and could expose to additional risk that could harm our financial condition and operating result risk related to our industrypeople access the internet through variety of platform and device that continue to evolve with the advancement of technology and user preference if manufacturer and user do not widely adopt version of our product and service developed for these interface our business could be harmed people access the internet through growing variety of device such desktop computer mobile phone smartphones laptop and tablet video game console voice activated speaker wearable automobile and television streaming device our product and service may be le popular on some interface each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standard for it device and our product and service may not be available or may only be available with limited functionality for our user or our advertiser on these device result some manufacturer may also elect not to include our product on their device in addition search query are increasingly being undertaken via voice activated speaker apps social medium or other platform which could harm our business it is hard to predict the challenge we may encounter in adapting our product and service and developing competitive new product and service we expect to continue to devote significant resource to creating and supporting product and service across multiple platform and device failing to attract and retain substantial number of new device manufacturer supplier distributor developer and user or failing to develop product and technology that work well on new device and platform could harm our business financial condition and operating result and ability to capture future business opportunity data privacy and

reputation brand and business and impair our ability to attract and retain user or customer such incident have occurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the scale and nature of our product and service while there is no guarantee that such incident will not cause significant damage we expect to continue to expend significant resource to maintain security protection that limit the effect of bug theft misuse and security vulnerability or breach we experience cyber attack and other attempt to gain unauthorized access to our system on regular basis cyber attack continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and inherently may be difficult to detect for long period of time we have seen and will continue to see industry wide vulnerability such the vulnerability reported in december which could affect our or other party system we expect to continue to experience such of contentsalphabet inc incident or vulnerability in the future our effort to address undesirable activity on our platform may also increase the risk of retaliatory attack we may experience future security issue whether due to employee error or malfeasance or system error or vulnerability in our or other party system while we may not determine some of these issue to be material at the time they occur and may remedy them quickly there is no guarantee that these issue will not ultimately result in significant legal financial and reputational harm including government inquiry and enforcement action litigation and negative publicity because the technique used to obtain unauthorized access to disable or degrade service provided by or otherwise sabotage system change frequently and often are recognized only after being launched target even taking all reasonable precaution including those required by law we have been unable in the past and may continue to be unable to anticipate or detect attack or vulnerability or implement adequate preventative measure further if any partner with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate data security practice or fail to comply with our term and policy or otherwise suffer network or other security breach our

may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident result we may suffer significant legal reputational or financial exposure which could harm our business financial condition and operating result for additional information see also our risk factor on privacy and data protection regulation under risk related to law and regulation below our ongoing investment in safety security and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of our platform and misuse of user data in addition to our effort to prevent and mitigate cyber attack we are making significant investment in safety security and review effort to combat misuse of our service and unauthorized access to user data by third party including investigation and review of platform application that could access the information of user of our service result of these effort we have in the past discovered and may in the future discover incident of unnecessary access to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third

and attention and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight problematic content on our platform including low quality user generated content web spam content farm and other violation of our guideline could affect the quality of our service which could damage our reputation and deter our current and potential user from using our product and service we like others in the industry face violation of our content guideline across our platform including sophisticated attempt by bad actor to manipulate our hosting and advertising system to fraudulently generate revenue or to otherwise generate traffic that doe not represent genuine user interest or intent while we invest significantly in effort to promote high quality and relevant result and to detect and prevent low quality content and of contentsalphabet inc invalid traffic we have been unable and may continue to be unable to adequately detect and prevent all such abuse or promote uniformly high quality content many website violate or attempt to violate our guideline including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search result than our search engine assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them such effort have affected and may continue to affect the quality of content on our platform and lead them to display false misleading or undesirable content although english language web spam in our search result ha been reduced and web spam in most other language is limited we expect web spammer will continue to seek inappropriate way to improve their ranking we continuously combat web spam in our search result including through indexing technology that make it harder for spam like le useful web content to rank highly we also continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam on our platform we also face other challenge from low quality and irrelevant content website including content farm which are website that generate large quantity of low quality content to help them improve their search ranking we are continually launching algorithmic change designed to detect and prevent abuse from low quality website we also face other challenge on our platform including violation of our content guideline involving incident such attempted election interference activity that threaten the safety and or well being of our user on or off line and the spreading of

and damage and divert management time and attention our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by and our user internet access provider may be able to restrict block degrade or charge for access to certain of our product and service which could lead to additional expense and the loss of user and advertiser our product and service depend on the ability of our user to access the internet and certain of our product require significant bandwidth to work effectively currently this access is provided by company that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace including incumbent telephone company cable company mobile communication company and government owned service provider some of these provider have taken or have stated that they may take measure that could degrade disrupt or increase the cost of user access to certain of our product by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offering by charging increased fee to or our user to provide our offering or by providing our competitor preferential access some jurisdiction have adopted regulation prohibiting certain form of discrimination by internet access provider however substantial uncertainty exists in the and elsewhere regarding such protection for example in the federal communication commission repealed net neutrality rule which could permit internet access provider to restrict block degrade or charge for access to certain of our product and service in addition in some jurisdiction our product and service have been subject to government initiated restriction or blockage these could harm existing key relationship including with our user customer advertiser and or content provider and impair our ability to attract new one damage our reputation and increase cost thereby negatively affecting our business risk related to law regulation and policieswe face increased regulatory scrutiny well change in regulatory condition law and policy governing wide range of topic that may negatively affect our business we and other company in the technology industry face increased regulatory scrutiny enforcement action and other proceeding for instance the department of justice joined by number of state attorney general filed an antitrust complaint against google on october alleging that google violated antitrust law relating to search and search advertising similarly on december number of state attorney general filed an antitrust complaint against google in the district court for the eastern district of texas alleging that google violated antitrust law well state deceptive trade law relating to it advertising technology various other regulatory agency in the and around the world including competition enforcer consumer protection agency data protection authority grand jury inter agency consultative group and range of other governmental body have and continue to review and in some case challenge our product and service and their compliance with law and regulation around the world we continue to cooperate with these investigation and defend litigation where appropriate various law regulation investigation enforcement lawsuit and regulatory action have in the past and may in the future result in substantial fine and penalty injunctive relief ongoing auditing and monitoring obligation change to our product and service alteration to our business model and operation and collateral litigation all of which could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating result of contentsalphabet inc change in international and local social political economic tax and regulatory condition or in law and policy have in the past and may in the future increase our cost of doing business and limit our ability to pursue certain business model offer product or service in certain jurisdiction or cause to change our business practice we have in the past had to alter or stop offering certain product and service result of law or regulation that made them unfeasible and new law or regulation could result in our to terminate alter or withdraw product and service in the future additional cost of doing business new limitation or change to our business model or practice could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating result we are subject to regulation law and policy that govern wide range of topic including those related to matter beyond our core product and service for instance new regulation law policy and international accord relating to environmental and social matter including sustainability climate change human capital and diversity are being developed and formalized in europe the and elsewhere which may entail specific target driven framework and or disclosure requirement we have implemented robust environmental and social program adopted reporting framework and principle and announced number of goal and initiative including those related to environmental sustainability and diversity the implementation of these goal and initiative may require considerable investment and our goal with all of their contingency dependency and in certain case reliance on third party verification and or performance are complex and ambitious and we can not guarantee that we will achieve them additionally there can be no assurance that our current program reporting framework and principle will be in compliance with any new environmental and social law and regulation that may be promulgated in the and elsewhere and the cost of changing any of our current practice to comply with any new legal and regulatory requirement in the and elsewhere may be substantial furthermore industry and market practice may further develop to become even more robust than what is required under any new law and regulation and we may have to expend significant effort and resource to keep with market trend and stay competitive among our peer variety of new and existing law and or interpretation could harm our business we are subject to numerous and foreign law and regulation covering wide variety of subject matter new law and regulation or new interpretation or application of existing law and regulation in manner inconsistent with our practice have made and may continue to make our product and service le useful limit our ability to pursue certain business model or offer certain product and service in certain jurisdiction require to incur substantial cost expose to civil or criminal liability or cause to change our business practice these law and regulation are evolving and involve matter central to our business including among others law and regulation around the world focused on large technology platform including the digital market act in the european union and proposed antitrust legislation on self preferencing and merger and acquisition in the which may limit certain business practice and in some case create the risk of significant penalty privacy law such the gdpr ccpa cpra virginia cdpa and colopa defined and discussed further below data protection law passed by many state within the and by certain country regarding notification to data subject and or regulator when there is security breach of personal data consumer protection law including eu new deal for consumer which could result in monetary penalty and create range of new compliance obligation new law further restricting the collection processing and or sharing of advertising related data copyright or similar law around the world including the eu directive on copyright in the digital single market eucd and eu member state transposition these and similar law that have been adopted or proposed introduce new licensing regime that could affect our ability to operate the eucd and similar law could also increase the liability of some content sharing service with respect to content uploaded by their user some of these law well follow on administrative or judicial action have also created or may create new property right in news publication that limit the ability of some online service to link to interact with or present such content they may also require individual or collective compensation negotiation with news agency and publisher for the use of such content which may result in payment obligation that significantly exceed the value that such content provides to google and it user potentially harming our service commercial operation and business result data localization law which generally mandate that certain type of data collected in particular country be stored and or processed within that country of contentsalphabet inc various and international law that govern the distribution of certain material to child and regulate the ability of online service to collect information from minor including the child online privacy protection act of and the united kingdom age appropriate design code various law with regard to content moderation and removal and related disclosure obligation such the network enforcement act in germany and the european union pending digital service act which may affect our business and operation and may subject to significant fine if such law are interpreted and applied in manner inconsistent with our practice or when we may not proactively discover such content due to the scale of third party content and the limitation of existing technology other country including singapore australia and the united kingdom have implemented or are considering similar legislation imposing penalty for failure to remove certain type of content various legislative litigation and regulatory activity regarding our google play billing policy and business model which could result in monetary penalty damage and or prohibition various legislative and regulatory activity requiring disclosure of information about the operation of our service and algorithm which may make it easier for website to artificially promote low quality deceptive or harmful content on service like google search and youtube potentially harming the quality of our service in addition the applicability and scope of these law interpreted by the court remain uncertain and could harm our business for example we rely on statutory safe harbor set forth in the digital millennium copyright act and section of the communication decency act in the and the commerce directive in europe against liability for various linking caching and hosting activity any legislation or court ruling affecting these safe harbor may adversely affect there are legislative proposal in both the and eu that could reduce our safe harbor protection court decision such the judgment of the court of justice of the european union cjeu on may on the right to be forgotten which allows individual to demand that google remove search result about them in certain instance may limit the content we can show to our user and impose significant operational burden the introduction of new business product service and technology our activity in certain jurisdiction or other action we take have subjected and will likely continue to subject to additional law and regulation our investment in variety of new field such healthcare and payment service ha expanded and will continue to expand the scope of regulation that apply to our business the cost of compliance with these law and regulation are high and are likely to increase in the future any failure on our part to comply with law and regulation can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject to significant liability and other penalty we are subject to claim suit government investigation other proceeding and consent decree that may harm our business financial condition and operating result we are subject to claim suit government investigation other proceeding and consent decree involving competition intellectual property data privacy and security consumer protection tax labor and employment commercial dispute content generated by our user good and service offered by advertiser or publisher using our platform and other matter due to our manufacturing and sale of an expanded suite of product and service including hardware well google cloud offering we also are subject to variety of claim

ongoing basis we have reviewed our critical accounting estimate with the audit and compliance committee of our board of director see note of the note to consolidated financial statement included in item of this annual report on form for summary of significant accounting policy and the effect on our financial statement fair value measurement of non marketable equity securitieswe measure certain financial instrument at fair value on nonrecurring basis consisting primarily of our non marketable equity security these investment are accounted for under the measurement alternative and are measured at cost le impairment subject to upward and downward adjustment resulting from observable price change for identical or similar investment of the same issuer these adjustment require quantitative assessment of the fair value of our security which may require the use of unobservable input pricing adjustment are determined by using various valuation methodology and involve the use of estimate using the best information available which may include cash flow projection or other available market data non marketable equity security are also evaluated for impairment based on qualitative factor including the company financial and liquidity position and access to capital resource among others when indicator of impairment exist we prepare quantitative measurement of the fair value of our equity investment using market approach or an income approach which requires judgment and the use of unobservable input including discount rate investee revenue and cost and comparable market data of private and public company among others when our assessment indicates that an impairment exists we write the investment to it fair value of contentsalphabet inc we also have compensation arrangement with payouts based on realized return from certain investment performance fee we recognize compensation expense based on the estimated payouts which may result in expense recognized before investment return are realized and may require the use of unobservable input property and equipmentwe ass the reasonableness of the useful life of our property and equipment periodically well when other change occur such when there are change to ongoing business operation change in the planned use and utilization of asset or technological advancement that could indicate change in the period over which we expect to benefit from the asset income taxeswe are subject to income tax in the and foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax position and determining our provision for income tax recording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative consideration including evaluation of comparable and resolved tax exposure applicability of tax law and likelihood of settlement we evaluate uncertain tax position periodically considering change in fact and circumstance such new regulation or recent judicial opinion well the status of audit activity by taxing authority although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax position no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matter will not be different to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matter is different than the amount recorded such difference will affect the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income tax includes the effect of reserve provision and change to reserve that are considered appropriate well the related net interest and penalty in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax return by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authority which may assert assessment against we regularly ass the likelihood of adverse outcome resulting from these examination and assessment to determine the adequacy of our provision for income tax loss contingencieswe are regularly subject to claim suit regulatory and government investigation and other proceeding involving competition intellectual property privacy tax and related compliance labor and employment commercial dispute content generated by our user good and service offered by advertiser or publisher using our platform personal injury consumer protection and other matter certain of these matter include speculative claim for substantial or indeterminate amount of damage we record liability when we believe that it is probable that loss ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine that loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in note of the note to consolidated financial statement included in item of this annual report on form we evaluate on regular basis development in our legal matter that could affect the amount of liability that ha been previously accrued and the matter and related reasonably possible loss disclosed and make adjustment and change to our disclosure appropriate significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the estimated amount of loss related to such matter the final resolution of such matter there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded and such amount could be material change in accounting estimatein january we completed an assessment of the useful life of our server and certain network equipment in doing so we determined we should adjust the estimated useful life this change in accounting estimate wa effective beginning fiscal year and is detailed further in note of the note to consolidated financial statement included in item of this annual report on form item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskwe are exposed to financial market risk including change in foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and equity investment risk foreign currency exchange riskwe transact business globally in multiple currency international revenue well cost and expense denominated in foreign currency expose to the risk of fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate against the dollar principal currency hedged included the australian dollar british pound canadian dollar euro and japanese yen for the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk we considered the historical trend in of contentsalphabet inc foreign currency exchange rate and determined that it wa reasonably possible that adverse change in exchange rate of could be experienced in the near term we use foreign exchange forward contract to offset the foreign exchange risk on asset and liability denominated in currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary these forward contract reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movement on our asset and liability the foreign currency gain and loss on these asset and liability are recorded in other income expense net which are offset by the gain and loss on the forward contract if an adverse foreign currency exchange rate change wa applied to total monetary asset liability and commitment denominated in currency other than the functional currency at the balance sheet date it would have resulted in an adverse effect on income before income tax of approximately million and million of december and respectively after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contract in place for the year ended december and we use foreign currency forward and option contract including collar an option strategy comprised of combination of purchased and written option to protect forecasted dollar equivalent earnings from change in foreign currency exchange rate when the dollar strengthens gain from foreign currency option and forward reduce the foreign currency loss related to our earnings when the dollar weakens loss from foreign currency collar and forward offset the foreign currency gain related to our earnings these hedging contract reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movement we designate these contract cash flow hedge for accounting purpose we reflect the gain or loss of foreign currency spot rate change component of aoci and subsequently reclassify them into revenue to offset the hedged exposure they occur if the dollar weakened by of december and the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign exchange contract before tax effect would have been approximately million and billion lower of december and respectively the change in the value recorded in aoci would be expected to offset corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenue when recognized we use foreign exchange forward contract designated net investment hedge to hedge the foreign currency risk related to investment in foreign subsidiary these forward contract serve to offset the foreign currency translation risk from our foreign operation if the dollar weakened by the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment cta within aoci related to our net investment hedge would have been approximately billion lower of both december and the change in value recorded in cta would be expected to offset corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiary interest rate riskour corporate treasury investment strategy is to achieve return that will allow to preserve capital and maintain liquidity we invest primarily in debt security including those of the government and it agency corporate debt security mortgage backed security money market and other fund municipal security time deposit asset backed security and debt instrument issued by foreign government by policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer our investment in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning security carry degree of interest rate risk fixed rate security may have their fair market value adversely affected due to rise in interest rate while floating rate security may produce le income than predicted if interest rate fall unrealized gain or loss on our marketable debt security are primarily due to interest rate fluctuation compared to interest rate at the time of purchase for certain fixed and variable rate debt security we have elected the fair value option for which change in fair value are recorded in other income expense net we measure security for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gain and loss recorded in aoci until the security are sold le any expected credit loss we use value at risk var analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuation in interest rate on the value of our marketable debt security portfolio the var is the expected loss in fair value for given confidence interval for our investment portfolio due to adverse movement in interest rate we use variance covariance var model with confidence interval the estimated one day loss in fair value of marketable debt security of december and are shown below in million of december month average of december category interest rate of contentsalphabet inc actual future gain and loss associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the sensitivity analysis performed of december and due to the inherent limitation associated with predicting the timing and amount of change in interest rate and our actual exposure and position var analysis is not intended to represent actual loss but is used risk estimation equity investment riskour marketable and non marketable equity security are subject to wide variety of market related risk that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holding our marketable equity security are publicly traded stock or fund and our non marketable equity security are investment in privately held company some of which are in the startup or development stage we record marketable equity security not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable market value of which publicly traded stock and mutual fund are subject to market price volatility and represent billion and billion of our investment of december and respectively hypothetical adverse price change of on our december balance which could be experienced in the near term would decrease the fair value of marketable equity security by million from time to time we may enter into derivative to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity security our non marketable equity security not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for observable transaction for identical or similar investment of the same issuer or impairment referred to the measurement alternative the fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an indication of the current fair value of the balance sheet date these investment especially those that are in the early stage are inherently risky because the technology or product these company have under development are typically in the early phase and may never materialize and they may experience decline in financial condition which could result in loss of substantial part of our investment in these company the success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of investment through liquidity event such public offering acquisition private sale or other market event of december and the carrying value of our non marketable equity security which were accounted for under the measurement alternative wa billion and billion respectively valuation of our equity investment in private company are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data volatility in the global economic climate and financial market could result in significant impairment charge relating to our non marketable equity security change in valuation of non marketable equity security may not directly correlate with change in valuation of marketable equity security additionally observable transaction at lower valuation could result in significant loss on our non marketable equity security the effect of covid on our impairment assessment requires significant judgment due to the uncertainty around the duration and severity of the effect the carrying value of our equity method investment which totaled approximately billion and billion of december and respectively generally do not fluctuate based on market price change however these investment could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover for further information about our equity investment see note and note of the note to consolidated financial statement included in item of this annual report on
