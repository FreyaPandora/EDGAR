material adverse effect on our business taken whole raw material supplier and seasonalitysome of our product require relatively scarce raw material historically we have been successful in obtaining the raw material and other supply needed in our manufacturing process we seek to manage raw material supply risk through long term contract and by maintaining an acceptable level of the key material in inventory aluminum and titanium are important raw material used in certain of our aeronautics and space program long term agreement have helped enable continued supply of aluminum and titanium carbon fiber is an important ingredient in composite material used in our aeronautics program such the aircraft we have been advised by some supplier that pricing and the timing of availability of material in some commodity market fluctuate widely fluctuation may negatively affect the price and availability of certain material we do not anticipate material problem regarding the supply of our raw material and believe that we have taken appropriate measure to mitigate these variation if key material become unavailable or if pricing fluctuates widely in the future it could result in delay of one or more of our program increased cost or reduced operating profit or cash flow of content we rely on other company to provide material major component and product and to perform portion of the service that are provided to our customer under the term of most of our contract failure by one or more of these supplier or subcontractor to provide the agreed upon supply or perform the agreed upon

eliminated or necessarily predicted the outcome of one or more of these risk could have material effect on our operating result financial position or cash flow should carefully consider the following factor in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form before deciding to purchase our common stock or debt security risk related to our reliance on government contractswe depend heavily on contract with the government including contract related to the program for substantial portion of our business change in the government priority and delay or reduction in spending could have material adverse effect on our business we derived of our total net sale from the government in including from the dod we expect to continue to derive most of our sale from work performed under government contract those contract are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriation congress usually appropriates fund on fiscal year fy basis even though contract performance may extend over many year consequently contract are often partially funded initially and additional fund are committed only congress make appropriation if we incur cost in excess of fund obligated on contract we may be at risk for reimbursement of those cost unless and additional fund are obligated to the contract the program which consists of multiple development production and sustainment contract is our largest program it represented of our total net sale in decision by the government or other government to cut spending on this program or reduce or delay planned order would have an adverse impact on our business and result of operation given the size and complexity of the program we anticipate that there will be continual review related to aircraft performance program schedule cost and requirement part of the dod congressional and international partner oversight and budgeting process current program challenge include but are not limited to supplier and partner performance including covid related challenge software development the availability and receipt of funding for contract on timely basis execution of future flight test and finding resulting from testing and operating the aircraft the level of cost associated with life cycle operation and sustainment and warranty continuing to reduce the unit production cost and achieving cost target budget uncertainty the risk of future budget cut the potential for government shutdown the use of continuing resolution and the federal debt ceiling can adversely affect our industry and the funding for our program if government of content shutdown were to occur and were to continue for an extended period of time we could be at risk of program cancellation and other disruption and nonpayment if the government operates under continuing resolution new contract and program start are restricted and funding for our program may be unavailable reduced or delayed shifting funding priority including covid related spending or federal budget compromise could also result in reduction in overall defense spending which could adversely impact our business our business could also be adversely impacted by reduction or delay in spending by non government customer who are facing budget pressure we believe our diverse range of product and service generally make it le likely that cut in any specific contract or program will affect our business on long term basis however termination of multiple or large program or contract could adversely affect our business and future financial performance change in funding priority may afford new or additional opportunity for our business in term of existing follow on or replacement program but could also reduce opportunity in existing program and in planned program where we intend to compete while we would expect to compete and be well positioned the incumbent on existing program we may not be successful or even if successful the replacement program may be funded at lower level we are subject to number of procurement law and regulation including the government ability to terminate contract for convenience our business and reputation could be adversely affected if we or those we do business with fail to comply with these law we must comply with and are affected by law and regulation relating to the award administration and performance of government contract government contract law and regulation affect how we do business with our customer and impose certain risk and cost on our business violation of these law and regulation by our employee others working on our behalf supplier or joint venture partner could harm our reputation and result in the imposition of fine and penalty the termination of our contract suspension or debarment from bidding on or being awarded contract loss of our ability to export product or perform service and civil or criminal investigation or proceeding in addition cost to comply with new government regulation can increase our cost reduce our margin and affect our competitiveness in some instance these law and regulation impose term or obligation that are different than those typically found in commercial transaction for example the government may terminate any of our government contract and subcontract not only for default based on our performance but also at it convenience upon termination for convenience of fixed price type contract typically we are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered item reimbursement for allowable cost for work in process and an allowance for profit on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in loss upon termination for convenience of cost reimbursable contract we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable cost plus portion of the fee and allowable cost include our cost to terminate agreement with our supplier and subcontractor the amount of the fee recovered if any is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation we attempt to ensure that adequate fund are available by notifying the customer when it estimated cost including those associated with possible termination for convenience approach level specified being allotted to it program fund are typically appropriated on fiscal year basis and because the cost of termination for convenience may exceed the cost of continuing program in given fiscal year program occasionally do not have sufficient fund appropriated to cover the termination cost if the government were to terminate them for convenience under such circumstance the government could assert that it is not required to appropriate additional funding termination arising of our default may expose to liability and have material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contract and order in addition on those contract for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor the government could terminate prime contract under which we are subcontractor notwithstanding the fact that our performance and the quality of the product or service we delivered were consistent with our contractual obligation subcontractor in the case of termination for default the government could make claim to reduce the contract value or recover it procurement cost and could ass other special penalty under such circumstance we may have right and there may be remedial action available to under applicable law and the far additionally our program for the government often operate for period of time under undefinitized contract action uca which mean that we begin performing our obligation before the term specification or price are finally agreed to between the party the government ha the ability to unilaterally definitize contract which absent successful appeal obligates to perform under term and condition imposed by the government the government ha unilaterally definitized contract with in the past most notably the lrip contract in and more recently two fm upgrade proposal in and may do so in the future the government power to unilaterally definitize contract can affect our ability to negotiate mutually agreeable contract term and if contract is unilaterally imposed upon it may negatively affect our expected profit and cash flow on program or impose burdensome term of content certain of our government contract span one or more base year and include multiple option year the government generally ha the right not to exercise option period and may decide not to exercise an option period for various reason the government also may decide to exercise option period for contract under which it is expected that our cost may exceed the contract price or ceiling which could result in loss or unreimbursed cost evolving government procurement policy and increased emphasis on cost over performance and rapid acquisition could adversely affect our business the government could implement procurement policy that negatively impact our profitability or the ability to win new business change in procurement policy favoring more incentive based fee arrangement different award fee criterion or government contract negotiation offer based upon the customer view of our cost should be compared to our actual cost may affect the predictability of our profit rate or make it more difficult to compete on certain type of program our customer also may pursue non traditional contract provision or contract type in negotiation of contract the government preference for fixed price contracting ha resulted in what we believe to be the inappropriate application of fixed priced contracting method to development program by their nature the technical challenge cost and timing of development program are difficult to estimate and the use of fixed price instead of cost reimbursable contract for such program increase the financial risk to the contractor this increased risk may lead to loss on fixed price development program or may cause not to bid on future fixed price development program which could adversely affect our future growth prospect and financial performance in addition given the customer emphasis on cost even if we effectively manage program life cycle and sustainment cost and meet customer affordability target the customer may elect to recompete program at the end of existing contract which may result in lost business opportunity from time to time the government also ha proposed contract term or taken position that represent fundamental change from historical practice or that we believe are inconsistent with the far or other law and regulation and which could adversely affect our business the dod also is increasingly pursuing rapid development and acquisition of new technology through rapid acquisition pathway and procedure including through other transaction authority agreement otas while otas do not currently represent significant portion of our overall contract le than of total backlog in recent year the dod ha increased the frequency of use and size of otas and we expect this trend to continue in the future otas are exempt from many traditional procurement law including the far and may be used subject to certain condition for research prototype development and follow on production for successful prototype the condition to award otas include in certain instance that significant portion of the work under the ota is performed by non traditional defense contractor or that portion of the cost of the protype project is funded by non governmental source if we can not successfully adapt to the dod rapid acquisition process or if the dod significantly increase the use of otas with non traditional defense contractor or increasingly mandate cost sharing we may lose strategic new business opportunity in high growth area and our future performance and result could be adversely affected shorter life cycle technology rather than large platform could also make our existing portfolio le competitive in the future recommended by june government accountability office gao report on contract financing the dod ha stated that it will conduct comprehensive assessment of the effect that dod contract financing and profit policy have on the defense industry we have no assurance regarding the full scope and recurrence of any study and what change will be proposed if any and their impact on our working capital cash flow profit or result of operation earlier change proposed by the dod in and later withdrawn would have had negative effect on the timing of our cash flow we are routinely subject to audit by our customer on government contract and the result of those audit could have an adverse effect on our business reputation and result of operation government agency including the defense contract audit agency the defense contract management agency and various agency inspector general routinely audit and investigate government contractor these agency review contractor performance under it contract it cost structure it business system and compliance with applicable law regulation and standard the government ha the ability to decrease or withhold certain payment when it deems system subject to it review to be inadequate additionally any cost found to be misclassified may be subject to repayment and from time to time we have had substantial disagreement with government auditor regarding the allowability of cost incurred by under government contract which further delay payment even if we are correct in our position we have unaudited or unsettled incurred cost claim related to past year which limit our ability to issue final billing on contract for which authorized and appropriated fund may be expiring or can result in substantial delay in final billing and our ability to close out contract if an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activity we may be subject to civil or criminal penalty and administrative sanction including reduction of the value of contract contract modification or termination forfeiture of profit suspension of payment penalty fine suspension or prohibition from doing business with the government in of content addition we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegation of impropriety were made against similar government oversight exists in most other country where we conduct business our profitability and cash flow may vary based on the mix of our contract and program our performance and our ability to control cost our profitability and cash flow may vary materially depending on the type of government contract undertaken the nature of product produced or service performed under those contract the cost incurred in performing the work the achievement of other performance objective and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fee is determined particularly under award and incentive fee contract failure to perform to customer expectation and contract requirement may result in reduced fee or loss and may adversely affect our financial performance our backlog includes variety of contract type and represents the sale we expect to recognize for our product and service in the future contract type primarily include fixed price and cost reimbursable contract under each type of contract if we are unable to control cost our operating result could be adversely affected particularly if we are unable to justify an increase in contract value to our customer cost overrun or the failure to perform on existing program also may adversely affect our ability to retain existing program and win future contract award under fixed price contract we agree to perform specified work for pre determined price to the extent our actual cost vary from the estimate upon which the price wa negotiated we will generate more or le profit or could incur loss some fixed price contract have performance based component under which we may earn incentive payment or incur financial penalty based on our performance cost reimbursable contract provide for the payment of allowable cost incurred during performance of the contract plus fee up to ceiling based on the amount that ha been funded typically we enter into three type of cost reimbursable contract cost plus award fee cost plus incentive fee and cost plus fixed fee cost plus award fee contract provide for an award fee that varies within specified limit based on the customer assessment of our performance against predetermined set of criterion such target based on cost quality technical and schedule criterion cost plus incentive fee contract provide for reimbursement of cost plus fee that is adjusted by formula based on the relationship of total allowable cost to total target cost incentive based on cost or reimbursement of cost plus an incentive to exceed stated performance target incentive based on performance the fixed fee in cost plus fixed fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed fee not vary with actual cost contract for development program with complex design and technical challenge are often cost reimbursable in these case the associated financial risk primarily relate to reduction in fee and the program could be canceled if cost schedule or technical performance issue arise other contract included in our backlog are for the transition from development to production lrip contract which includes the challenge of starting and stabilizing manufacturing production and test line while the final design is being validated and managing change in requirement or capability these contract frequently are cost reimbursable or fixed price incentive fee contract generally if our cost exceed the contract target cost or are not allowable under the applicable regulation we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all cost and may have our fee reduced or eliminated there are also contract for production well operation and maintenance of the delivered product that have the challenge of achieving stable production and delivery rate while maintaining operability of the product after delivery these contract are primarily fixed price in addition certain contract associated with our space business segment contain provision that require to forfeit fee pay penalty or provide replacement system in the event of performance failure which could negatively affect our earnings and cash flow increased competition and bid protest in budget constrained environment may make it more difficult to maintain our financial performance and customer relationship substantial portion of our business is awarded through competitive bidding the government increasingly ha relied on competitive contract award type including indefinite delivery indefinite quantity and other multi award contract which have the potential to create pricing pressure and to increase our cost by requiring to submit multiple bid and proposal multi award contract require to make sustained effort to obtain task order under the contract additionally competitive bid that do not contain cost realism evaluation criterion can lead to competitor taking aggressive pricing position the competitive bidding process entail substantial cost and managerial time to prepare bid and proposal for contract that may not be awarded to or may be split among competitor the government also may not award large competitive contract that we otherwise might have in an effort to maintain broader industrial base even if we are successful in obtaining an award we may encounter bid protest from unsuccessful bidder on new program award unsuccessful bidder may protest in the hope of being awarded subcontract for portion of the work in return for of content withdrawing the protest bid protest could result in significant expense to contract modification or even loss of the contract award even where bid protest doe not result in the loss of contract award the resolution can extend the time until contract activity can begin and result delay the recognition of sale we also may not be successful in our effort to protest or challenge any bid for contract that were not awarded to and we could incur significant time and expense in such effort we are experiencing increased competition including from emerging non traditional competitor while at the time many of our customer are facing significant budget pressure trying to do more with le by cutting cost using fixed price contract deferring large procurement identifying more affordable solution performing certain work internally rather than hiring contractor and reducing product development cycle if emerging competitor can offer faster or lower cost service and product at equivalent or even reduced capability then we may lose new business opportunity or contract recompetes which could adversely affect our future result our success in competing and remaining cost competitive may depend on our ability to adopt and integrate new digital manufacturing and operating technology and tool into our product lifecycles and process furthermore acquisition in our industry particularly vertical integration by tier prime contractor could also result in increased competition or limit our access to certain supplier to remain competitive we must maintain consistently strong customer relationship seek to understand customer priority and provide superior performance advanced technology solution and service at an affordable cost with the agility that our customer require to satisfy their mission objective in an increasingly price competitive environment other risk related to our operationsthe effect of covid and other potential future public health crisis epidemic pandemic or similar event on our business operating result and cash flow are uncertain the global outbreak of the coronavirus disease covid ha negatively affected the and global economy disrupted global supply chain resulted in significant travel and transport restriction including mandated closure and order to shelter in place and quarantine restriction the pandemic ha presented unprecedented business challenge and we have experienced impact in each of our business area related to covid primarily in increased coronavirus related cost delay in supplier delivery impact of travel restriction site access and quarantine requirement and the impact of remote work and adjusted work schedule the extent of the impact of the covid pandemic on our operational and financial performance including our ability to execute our program in the expected timeframe remains uncertain and will depend on future pandemic related development including the duration of the pandemic any potential subsequent wave of covid infection the effectiveness distribution and acceptance of covid vaccine and related government action to prevent and manage disease spread all of which are uncertain and can not be predicted the long term impact of covid on government budget and other funding priority including international priority that impact demand for our product and service and our business are also difficult to predict in accordance with the department of homeland security identification of the defense industrial base critical infrastructure sector in march our production facility have continued to operate during the pandemic however our operation have been adjusted in response to the pandemic including most significantly reduction in the production rate primarily due to supplier delay staffing level at our facility our customer facility and our supplier facility have and could continue to fluctuate result of covid which could negatively impact our business in addition country other than the have different response to the pandemic that can affect our international operation and the operation of our supplier and customer base closure travel restriction and quarantine requirement both within and outside the have affected our normal operation and resulted in some schedule delay and future or prolonged occurrence of these could adversely affect our ability to achieve future contract milestone and our result of operation described in the risk factor below we rely on other company and the government to provide material major component and product and to perform portion of the service that are provided to our customer under the term of most of our contract many of these supplier also supply part for commercial aviation business which have been more significantly impacted by the pandemic due to the impact on these market global supply chain disruption caused by the response to covid ha impacted some of our program and could impact our ability to perform on our contract in particular in instance where there is not qualified second source of supply we have identified number of supplier that have experienced delivery impact due to covid and have been working to manage those impact however if alternative or other mitigation are not effective delivery and other milestone on affected program could be adversely impacted delay in inspection acceptance and payment by our customer many of are teleworking could also affect our sale and cash flow this is particularly an issue with respect to classified work that is unable to be done remotely limitation on government operation can also impact regulatory approval such export license that are needed for international sale and delivery in addition we could experience delay in new program start or award of future work well the uncertain of content impact of contract modification to respond to the pandemic limitation on travel to customer could impact international order we have been granted some travel exemption to allow to continue certain activity but we have no assurance that they will continue or additional restriction will not be imposed if significant portion of our workforce are unable to work effectively including because of illness quarantine absenteeism government action facility closure travel restriction or other restriction due to covid our operation will be impacted and this could create risk to the effectiveness of our internal control additionally we have not previously experienced such significant portion of our workforce working remotely for prolonged period so it effect on our long term operation are unknown the impact of covid could worsen depending on the duration and spread of the covid pandemic or potential subsequent wave of covid infection in affected region after they have begun to experience improvement coronavirus related cost for and our supplier are significant and we are seeking reimbursement of coronavirus related cost under our government contract through combination of equitable adjustment to the contract price and reimbursement of the cost under section of the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act care act which allows federal agency to reimburse contractor for certain covid related cost from march through march these cost increase including cost for employee whose job can not be performed remotely and for certain cost incurred prior to march may not be fully recoverable under our contract particularly fixed price contract or adequately covered by insurance we also have no assurance that congress will appropriate fund to cover the reimbursement of defense contractor authorized by the care act which could reduce fund available for other government defense priority the continued spread of covid ha also led to disruption and volatility in the global capital market which depending on future development could impact our capital resource and liquidity in the future and the investment return on our pension asset we are also monitoring the impact of covid on the fair value of our asset while we do not currently anticipate any material impairment on our asset result of covid future change in expectation for sale earnings and cash flow related to intangible asset and goodwill below our current projection could cause these asset to be impaired for more information on the effect of covid on our operation and our response to covid see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation we are the prime contractor on most of our contract and if our subcontractor supplier or teaming agreement or joint venture partner fail to perform their obligation our performance and our ability to win future business could be harmed we rely on other company to provide material major component and product and to perform portion of the service that are provided to our customer under the term of most of our contract these arrangement may involve subcontract teaming arrangement joint venture or supply agreement with other company upon which we rely contracting party there is risk that the contracting party doe not perform at all or to our expectation or meet affordability target and we may have dispute with our contracting party including dispute regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed the workshare provided to that party customer concern about the other party performance our failure to extend existing task order or issue new task order or our hiring the personnel of subcontractor teammate or joint venture partner or vice versa we could also be adversely affected by action by or issue experienced by our contracting party that are outside of our control such misconduct and reputational issue involving our contracting party which could subject to liability or adversely affect our ability to compete for contract award change in the economic environment including the covid pandemic geopolitical event defense budget trade sanction and constraint on available financing and the highly competitive and budget constrained environment in which we operate may adversely affect the financial stability and viability of our contracting party or their ability to meet their performance requirement or to provide needed supply or service on timely basis some scarce raw material required for our product are largely controlled by single country including rare earth mineral that are largely controlled by china and therefore can be adversely impacted by potential trade action involving that country additionally our effort to increase the efficiency of our operation and improve the affordability of our product and service could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain supplier we must comply with specific procurement requirement which can limit the available supplier and we do not have secondary supplier for some supply and the qualification of new or additional supplier can under some circumstance take an extended period of time failure for whatever reason by one or more of our contracting party to provide the agreed upon supply or perform the agreed upon service on timely basis according to specification or at all may affect our ability to perform our obligation and require that we transition the work to other company contracting party performance deficiency may result in additional cost or delay in product delivery and affect our operating result and could result in customer terminating our contract for default or convenience default termination could expose to liability and affect our ability to compete for of content future contract and order failure by our contracting party to meet affordability target could negatively affect our profitability result in contract loss and affect our ability to win new business our success depends in part on our ability to develop new technology product and service and efficiently produce and deliver existing product many of the product and service we provide are highly engineered and involve sophisticated technology with related complex manufacturing and system integration process our customer requirement change and evolve regularly accordingly our future performance depends in part on our ability to adapt to changing customer need rapidly identify emerging technological trend develop and manufacture innovative product and service efficiently and bring those offering to market quickly at cost effective price this includes effort to implement emerging digital and network technology and capability to advance our innovation we may seek to collaborate with commercial entity that are not accustomed to government contracting and these entity may be unwilling to agree to the government customary term including those governing intellectual property due to the complex and often experimental nature of the product and service we offer we may experience technical difficulty during the development of new product or technology these technical difficulty could result in delay and higher cost which may negatively impact our financial result and could divert resource from other project until such product or technology are fully developed see note significant accounting policy included in our note to consolidated financial statement for further detail about loss incurred on certain development program additionally there can be no assurance that our development project will be successful or meet the need of our customer our competitor may also develop new technology or offering or more efficient way to produce existing product that could cause our existing offering to become obsolete or that could gain market acceptance before our own competitive offering if we fail in our development project or if our new product or technology fail to achieve customer acceptance we may be unsuccessful in procuring new contract or winning all or portion of next generation program and this could adversely affect our future performance and financial result we also may not be successful in our effort to grow in key area such hypersonics and mission system which could adversely affect our future performance international sale may pose different political economic regulatory competition and other risk in of our total net sale were from international customer we have strategy to continue to grow international sale inclusive of sale of aircraft to our international partner country and other country international sale are subject to numerous political and economic factor budget uncertainty regulatory requirement significant competition taxation and other risk associated with doing business in foreign country in international sale we face substantial competition from both manufacturer and international manufacturer whose government sometimes provide research and development assistance marketing subsidy and other assistance for their product and service additionally many of our competitor are also focusing on increasing their international sale our international business is conducted through foreign military sale fm contracted through the government to international customer through which the government purchase product or service from on behalf of the foreign customer and by direct commercial sale dc to such customer in approximately of our sale to international customer were fm and about were dc fm contract with the government are subject to the far and the dfars in contrast dc transaction represent sale by directly to international customer and are not subject to the far or the dfars all sale to international customer are subject to and foreign law and regulation including import export control technology transfer restriction investment taxation repatriation of earnings exchange control the foreign corrupt practice act and other anti corruption law and regulation and the anti boycott provision of the export control reform act of while we have extensive policy in place to comply with such law and regulation failure by our employee or others working on our behalf to comply with these law and regulation could result in administrative civil or criminal liability including suspension debarment from bidding for or performing government contract or suspension of our export privilege which could have material adverse effect on we frequently team with international subcontractor and supplier who also are exposed to similar risk international sale present risk that are different and potentially greater than those encountered in our business and we believe dc present the greatest potential risk dc transaction involve direct commercial relationship with party with whom we have le familiarity and where there may be significant cultural difference additionally international procurement and local country rule and regulation contract law and judicial system differ from those in the and in some case may be le developed than in the which could impair our ability to enforce contract and increase the risk of adverse or of content unpredictable outcome including the possibility that certain matter that would be considered civil matter in the are treated criminal matter in conjunction with defense procurement some international customer require contractor to comply with industrial cooperation regulation including entering into industrial participation or industrial development agreement sometimes referred to offset agreement condition to obtaining order for our product and service industrial development agreement generally extend over several year and obligate the contractor to perform certain commitment which may include in country purchase technology transfer local manufacturing support consulting support to in country project investment in joint venture and financial support project expectation to offset commitment can be substantial including high value content and may exceed existing local technical capability failure to meet these commitment which can be subjective and outside of our control may result in significant penalty and could lead to reduction in sale to country furthermore certain of our existing industrial development agreement are dependent upon the successful operation of joint venture that we do not control and involve product and service that are outside of our core business which may increase the risk that we fail to meet our industrial cooperation agreement expose to compliance risk of the joint venture and impair our ability to recover our investment for more information on our industrial development obligation including the notional value of our remaining industrial development obligation and potential penalty for non compliance see contractual commitment and off balance sheet arrangement in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation political issue and consideration both in the and internationally could have significant effect on our business our international business is highly sensitive to change in regulation including tariff sanction embargo export and import control and other trade restriction political environment or security risk that may affect our ability to conduct business outside of the including those regarding investment procurement taxation and repatriation of earnings on july and on october the people republic of china china announced it may impose sanction against lockheed martin in response to congressional notification of potential foreign military sale to taiwan foreign military sale are government to government transaction and we work closely with the government on any military sale to international customer we will continue to follow official government guidance it relates to sale to taiwan and do not see material impact on our sale at this time china ha not specified the nature of any such sanction but could seek to restrict our commercial sale or supply chain including our supply of rare earth or other raw material and could also impose sanction on our supplier teammate or partner the nature timing and potential impact of any sanction that may be imposed by china or any other related action that may be taken are uncertain we continue to monitor the effect of the united kingdom uk departure from the european union eu commonly referred to brexit on our business operation and financial result we anticipate that the most probable near term effect are likely to reflect the pressure brexit ha placed on the uk government which may influence the government ability to make decision on large complex program of the type we perform the post brexit border control between the uk and eu also may have adverse implication on the movement of product or sustainment activity between the uk and eu or may increase cost additionally longer term effect of brexit may impact the value of the pound sterling if the pound sterling were to remain depressed against the dollar this could negatively impact the ability of the uk government to afford our product and service while we have operation in the uk and these operation have activity between the uk and the eu sale supply chain or reliance on personnel we currently do not anticipate that brexit will have material impact on our operation or our financial result additionally our practice is to substantially hedge our transactional currency exposure and therefore we do not have material currency transaction exposure to the pound sterling or the euro international sale also may be adversely affected by action taken by the government in the exercise of foreign policy congressional oversight or the financing of particular program including the prevention or imposition of condition upon the sale and delivery of our product the imposition of sanction or congressional action to block sale of our product for example the government ha imposed certain sanction on turkish entity and person described in the risk factor below and could act in the future to prevent or restrict sale to other customer including the kingdom of saudi arabia and the united arab emirate government official have indicated that the biden administration is temporarily pausing the implementation of some pending defense transfer and sale to various country to allow incoming leadership an opportunity to review the official also state that the review is typical with any new administration but the duration and result of the review are unknown and if current sale are delayed or canceled or future sale prohibited or restricted our result from operation backlog and future performance could be adversely affected our international business also may be impacted by change in foreign national priority foreign government budget global economic condition and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate sale of military product and any associated industrial cooperation agreement are also affected by defense budget and foreign policy including trade restriction and dispute and there could be significant delay or other issue in reaching definitive agreement for announced program and international customer priority could change of content additionally the timing of order from our international customer can be le predictable than for our customer and may lead to fluctuation in the amount reported each year for our international sale government sanction on turkey and turkey removal from the program could adversely impact our result of operation and cash flow result of turkey accepting delivery of the russian air and missile defense system the government removed turkey from the program in and in december imposed sanction on turkey defense procurement agency ssb and certain of the agency officer under the countering america adversary through sanction act caatsa the primary sanction imposed wa restriction on all new export license and authorization for any good or technology transferred to the ssb but doe not apply to current valid export license and authorization lockheed martin expects the government to continue to engage turkey on these issue but we have no indication that the sanction will be removed that additional sanction will not be imposed or that turkey will not issue reciprocal sanction while we do not expect the current sanction to have material effect on our current program additional sanction reciprocal sanction or other action could be material to our operation operating result financial position or cash flow in addition to committed to purchase up to aircraft six of which had completed production at the time of removal turkish supplier continue to produce component part for the program some of which are single sourced to minimize the risk of disruption of our supply chain and ensure continuity of production we have been working closely with the dod and supporting activity to identify and engage alternate supplier for the component part produced by turkish supplier we have made significant progress transitioning to non turkish supplier but due to the procedure to qualify new part and supplier this collaborative process between dod and lockheed martin is ongoing during the dod publicly confirmed that turkish supplier would be permitted to provide certain component for the through while the transition timeline is an important first step it is equally important that our replacement capacity is re established so that production is not impacted effort to date have significantly reduced our risk but final resolution on limited number of remaining component could affect delivery and any accelerated work stoppage would impact cost we will continue to follow official government guidance it relates to completed turkish aircraft and the export and import of component part from the turkish supply chain the effect on the program of the government sanction on the ssb and turkey removal from the program do not appear to be significant at this time however unforeseen action could impact the timing of order disrupt the production of aircraft delay delivery of aircraft disrupt delivery of sustainment component produced in turkey and impact funding on the program to include the result of any reprogramming of fund that may be necessary to mitigate the impact of alternate source for component part made in turkey while in the case of the program we expect that these cost ultimately would be recovered from the government the availability or timing of any recovery could adversely affect our cash flow and result of operation we currently have program directly with ssb that include delivery and support of helicopter for turkish end user we also have contract with turkish industry for the turkish utility helicopter program tuhp which is overseen by ssb in support of turkish industry production of helicopter for turkish end user each program ha current valid export license that should not be subject to the current sanction we expect pending and future export licensing application and any required modification extension or change in scope to the existing license where ssb is party to the transaction would be denied adversely affecting our ability to perform the program contract in addition we have other program where we work with turkish industry including for domestic black hawk helicopter production that rely on component from turkish supplier while these commercial relationship are not affected by the current sanction they could be adversely affected by the imposition of additional sanction although the current sanction are not expected to have material effect on our current program they may result in the loss of future sale and any future sanction or reciprocal action by turkey could result in further restriction on export or import loss of future sale reduction in backlog return of advance payment cost to develop alternate supply source restriction on payment force majeure event or contract termination such activity also could result in claim from our supplier which may include both the amount established in any settlement agreement the cost of evaluating supplier settlement proposal and the cost of negotiating settlement agreement these effect could have material impact on our operating result financial position and cash flow of content we may be unable to benefit fully from or adequately protect our intellectual property right or use third party intellectual property which could negatively affect our business we routinely apply for and own substantial number of and foreign patent and trademark related to the product and service we provide in addition to owning large portfolio of patent and trademark we develop and own other intellectual property including copyright trade secret and research development and engineering know how which contribute significantly to our business we also license intellectual property to and from third party the far and dfars provide that the government obtains certain right in intellectual property including patent developed by and our subcontractor and supplier in performance of government contract or with government funding the government may use or authorize others including competitor to use such intellectual property non government may also have certain right in patent and other intellectual property developed in performance of our contract with these entity the government is pursuing aggressive position regarding the type of intellectual property to which government use right apply and when it is appropriate for the government to insist on broad use right the dod is also implementing an overarching intellectual property acquisition policy that will require greater focus and planning to intellectual property right for it program and we have no assurance to the potential impact of this policy or any associated regulatory change on future acquisition the dod effort could affect our ability to protect and exploit our intellectual property and to leverage supplier intellectual property for example if we are unable to obtain necessary license from our supplier to meet government requirement additionally while we take measure to protect and enforce our intellectual property right and to respect the intellectual property right of others our intellectual property and intellectual property licensed or obtained from third party is subject to challenge such infringement and misappropriation claim by third party which could adversely affect our ability to compete and perform on contract our business and financial performance depends in part on our ability to identify attract and retain highly skilled workforce due to the specialized nature of our business our performance is dependent upon our ability to identify attract and retain workforce with the requisite skill in multiple area including engineering science manufacturing information technology cybersecurity business development and strategy and management our operating performance is also dependent upon personnel who hold security clearance and receive substantial training in order to work on certain program or task additionally we expand our operation

affect personnel retention such our endeavor to increase the efficiency of our operation and improve the affordability of our product and service such workforce reduction and consolidating and relocating certain operation additionally substantial portion of our workforce including personnel in leadership position are retirement eligible or nearing retirement to the extent that we lose experienced personnel it is critical that we develop other employee hire new qualified personnel and successfully manage the short and long term transfer of critical knowledge and skill competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining personnel with the requisite skill or clearance we increasingly compete with commercial technology company outside of the aerospace and defense industry for qualified technical cyber and scientific position the number of qualified domestic engineer is decreasing and the number of cyber professional is not keeping up with demand to the extent that these company grow at faster rate or face fewer cost and product pricing constraint they may be able to offer more attractive compensation and other benefit to candidate or our existing employee if the demand for skilled personnel exceeds supply we could experience higher labor recruiting or training cost in order to attract and retain such employee we could experience difficulty in performing our contract and executing on new or growing program if we have shortage of skilled employee or if our recruiting is delayed we also must manage leadership development and succession planning throughout our business while we have process in place for management transition and the transfer of knowledge and skill the loss of key personnel coupled with an inability to adequately train other personnel hire new personnel or transfer knowledge and skill could significantly impact our ability to perform under our contract and execute on new or growing program approximately of our employee are covered by collective bargaining agreement with various union if we encounter difficulty with renegotiations or renewal of collective bargaining arrangement or are unsuccessful in those effort we could incur additional cost and experience work stoppage union action at supplier can also affect any delay or work stoppage could adversely affect our ability

insider threat and denial of service attack do our customer supplier subcontractor and joint venture partner we experience similar security threat at customer site that we operate and manage the threat we face vary from attack common to most industry to more advanced and persistent highly organized adversary including nation state these nation state actor target and other defense contractor for several reason including because we protect national security information and develop advanced technology system if we are unable to protect sensitive information including complying with evolving information security and data protection privacy regulation our customer or governmental authority could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection process and procedure moreover depending on the severity of an incident our customer data our employee data our intellectual property including trade secret and research development and engineering know how and other third party data such teammate joint venture partner subcontractor supplier and vendor could be compromised product and service we provide to customer also carry cybersecurity risk including risk that they could be breached or fail to detect prevent or combat attack which could result in loss to our customer and claim against and could harm our relationship with our customer we take variety of precaution to protect our system and data including computer incident response team cirt to defend against cyber attack and regular periodic training of our employee on protection of sensitive information including training intended to prevent the success of phishing attack however consequence of the persistence sophistication and volume of cyber attack we may not be successful in defending against all such attack we also have corporate wide counterintelligence and insider threat detection program to proactively identify external and internal threat and mitigate those threat in timely manner nevertheless due to the evolving nature of these security threat and the national security aspect of much of the data we protect the impact of any future incident can not be predicted in addition to cyber threat we experience threat to the security of our facility and employee and threat from terrorist act we also typically work cooperatively with our customer supplier subcontractor joint venture partner and entity we acquire whom are subject to similar threat to seek to minimize the impact of cyber threat other security threat or business disruption however we must rely on the safeguard put in place by these entity and other entity none of which we control who have access to our information and thus may affect the security of our information or the information we are obligated to protect these entity have varying level of cybersecurity expertise and safeguard and their relationship with government contractor including may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber threat we face we have thousand of direct supplier and even more indirect supplier with wide variety of system and cybersecurity capability and adversary actively seek to exploit security and cybersecurity weakness in our supply chain breach in our multi tiered supply chain could impact our data or customer deliverable we also must rely on this supply chain for detecting and reporting cyber incident which could affect our ability to report or respond to cybersecurity incident effectively or in timely manner the cost related to cyber or other security threat or disruption may not be fully insured or indemnified by other mean additionally some cyber technology we develop under contract for our customer particularly those related to homeland security may raise potential liability related to intellectual property and civil liberty including privacy concern which may not be fully insured or indemnified by other mean or involve reputational risk our enterprise risk management

including pension environmental and litigation costspension funding and cost are dependent on several economic assumption which if changed may cause our future earnings and cash flow to fluctuate significantly well affect the affordability of our product and service many of our employee and retiree participate in defined benefit pension plan retiree medical and life insurance plan and other postemployment plan collectively postretirement benefit plan the impact of these plan on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record for our postretirement benefit plan may materially change from year to year because the calculation are sensitive to change in several key economic assumption including interest rate and rate of return on plan asset other actuarial assumption including participant longevity also known mortality and employee turnover well the timing of cash funding change in these factor including actual return on plan asset may also affect our plan funding cash flow and stockholder equity in addition the funding of our plan and recovery of cost on our contract described below may also be subject to change caused by legislative or regulatory action with regard to cash flow we make substantial cash contribution to our plan required by the employee retirement income security act of erisa amended by the pension protection act of ppa we generally are able to recover these contribution related to our plan allowable cost on our government contract including fm however there is lag between the time when we contribute cash to our plan under pension funding rule and when we recover pension cost under government cost accounting standard ca we also may not be successful in our effort to reduce the volatility of our outstanding pension obligation and to accelerate ca recovery and recover associated cost from the government for more information on how these factor could impact earnings financial position cash flow and stockholder equity see critical accounting policy postretirement benefit plan in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation and note postretirement benefit plan included in our note to consolidated financial statement our estimate and projection may prove to be inaccurate and certain of our asset may be at risk of future impairment the accounting for some of our most significant activity is based on judgment and estimate which are complex and subject to many variable for example accounting for sale using the percentage of completion method requires that we ass risk and make assumption regarding schedule cost technical and performance issue for thousand of contract many of which are long term in nature additionally we initially allocate the purchase price of acquired business based on preliminary assessment of the fair value of identifiable asset acquired and liability assumed for significant acquisition we may use one year measurement period to analyze and ass number of factor used in establishing the asset and liability fair value of the acquisition date which could result in adjustment to asset and liability balance we have billion of goodwill asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet of december from previous acquisition which represents approximately of our total asset these goodwill asset are subject to annual impairment testing and more frequent testing upon the occurrence of certain event or significant change in circumstance that indicate goodwill may be impaired if we experience change or factor arise that negatively affect the expected cash flow of reporting unit we may be required to write off all or portion of the reporting unit related goodwill asset the carrying value and fair value of our sikorsky reporting unit are closely aligned therefore any business deterioration contract cancellation or termination or market pressure could cause our sale earnings and cash flow to decline below current projection and could cause goodwill and intangible asset to be impaired additionally sikorsky may not perform expected or demand for it product may be adversely affected by global economic condition including oil and gas trend that are outside of our control change in federal or state or foreign tax law and regulation or their interpretation and application including those with retroactive effect including the amortization for research or experimental expenditure could result in increase in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flow beginning in the tax cut and job act of eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditure currently and requires taxpayer to amortize them over five year while it is possible that congress may modify or repeal this provision before it take effect and we continue to have ongoing discussion with member of congress both on our own and with other industry through coalition we have no assurance that these provision will be modified or repealed furthermore we are continuing to work with our advisor to refine our legal interpretation of this provision prior to implementation in if these provision are not repealed and based on current interpretation of the law initially this would materially decrease our cash from operation based on current assumption beginning in by approximately billion and increase our net deferred tax asset by similar amount the largest impact would be on cash from operation which would depend on the amount of research and development expense paid or incurred in and other factor the impact however would continue over the five year amortization period but would of content decrease over the period and be immaterial in year six the amount of net deferred tax asset will change periodically based on several factor including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligation actual cash contribution to our postretirement benefit plan and future change in tax law in addition we are regularly under audit or examination by tax authority including foreign tax authority the final determination of tax audit and any related litigation could similarly result in unanticipated increase

these risk and liability the amount of insurance coverage that we maintain may not be adequate to cover all claim or liability existing coverage may be canceled while we remain exposed to the risk and it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risk natural hazard and liability for example we are limited in the amount of insurance we can obtain to cover certain natural hazard such earthquake fire or extreme weather condition we have significant operation in geographic area prone to these risk such in california florida and texas even if insurance coverage is available we may not be able to obtain it in an amount at price or on term acceptable to some insurance provider may be unable or unwilling to provide insurance given the nature of our business or product additionally dispute with insurance carrier over coverage term or the insolvency of one or more of our insurance carrier may significantly affect the amount or timing of our cash flow substantial cost resulting from an accident failure of or defect in our product or service natural catastrophe or other incident or liability arising from our product and service in excess of any legal protection indemnity and our insurance coverage or for which indemnity or insurance is not available or not obtained could adversely impact our financial condition cash flow and operating result

homeland security and information technology including cybersecurity we operate in four business segment aeronautics missile and fire control mfc rotary and mission system rms and space we organize our business segment based on the nature of the product and service offered we operate in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressure in the and globally significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our product and service and placing

necessary to succeed covid global outbreak of the coronavirus disease covid wa declared pandemic by the world health organization and national emergency by the government in march and ha negatively affected the and global economy disrupted global supply chain resulted in significant travel and transport restriction including mandated closure and order to shelter in place and quarantine restriction we have taken measure to protect the health and safety of our employee work with our customer and supplier to minimize disruption and support our community in addressing the challenge posed by this ongoing global pandemic the pandemic ha presented unprecedented business challenge and we have experienced impact in each of our business area related to covid primarily in increased coronavirus related cost delay in supplier delivery impact of travel restriction site access and quarantine requirement and the impact of remote work and adjusted work schedule despite these challenge lockheed martin and the government pro active effort especially with regard to the supply chain helped to partially mitigate the disruption caused by covid on our operation in in addition favorable contract award timing strong operational performance and lower travel and overhead expenditure due to covid restriction partially offset the impact of covid on our financial result in however the ultimate impact of covid on our operation and financial performance in future period including our ability to execute our program in the expected timeframe remains uncertain and will depend on future pandemic related development including the duration of the pandemic any potential subsequent wave of covid infection the effectiveness distribution and acceptance of covid vaccine and related government action to prevent and manage disease spread all of which are uncertain and can not be predicted the long term impact of covid on government budget and other funding priority including international priority that impact demand for our product and service and our business are also difficult to predict but could negatively affect our future result of operation for additional risk to the corporation related to the covid pandemic see item risk factor of content in accordance with the department of homeland security identification of the defense industrial base critical infrastructure sector in march our production facility have continued to operate in support of essential product and service required to meet national security commitment to the government and the military although we are designated critical infrastructure workforce operation have been adjusted in response to the pandemic including most significantly reduction in the production rate primarily due to supplier delay the reduction delayed delivery by aircraft due to the supplier delay we implemented temporary schedule adjustment for the production workforce in fort worth texas while the production workforce resumed their pre covid work schedule in the third quarter of staffing level at our facility our customer facility and our supplier facility have and could continue to fluctuate result of covid which could negatively impact our business in addition country other than the have different response to the pandemic that can affect our international operation and the operation of our supplier and customer base closure travel restriction and quarantine requirement both within and outside the have affected our normal operation and resulted in some schedule delay and future or prolonged occurrence of these could adversely affect our ability to achieve future contract milestone and our result of operation the government ha taken action in response to covid to increase the progress payment rate in new and existing contract and accelerate contract award to provide cash flow and liquidity for company in the defense industrial base including large prime contractor like lockheed martin and smaller supplier we continue to proactively monitor our supply chain and have implemented multiple action to help mitigate the effect of covid including accelerating payment to supplier within our global supply base result of the action taken by the dod in changing the progress payment policy we plan to continue to accelerate payment to the supply chain assuming the continuation of the current dod progress payment policy in order to mitigate covid risk prioritizing impacted supplier and small business described in item risk factor of our annual report on form we rely on other company and the government to provide material major component and product and to perform portion of the service that are provided to our customer under the term of most of our contract many of these supplier also supply part for commercial aviation business which have been more significantly impacted by the pandemic due to the impact on these market global supply chain disruption caused by the response to covid ha impacted some of our program and could impact our ability to perform on our contract in particular in instance where there is not qualified second source of supply we have identified number of supplier that have experienced delivery impact due to covid and have been working to manage those impact however if alternative or other mitigation are not effective delivery and other milestone on affected program could be adversely impacted our work in production facility and lab ha continued throughout the pandemic consistent with guidance from federal state and local official to minimize the spread of covid we have taken action to equip employee with personal protective equipment establish minimum staffing and social distancing policy sanitize workspace more frequently adopt alternate work schedule and institute other measure aimed to sustain production and related service while minimizing the transmission of covid in addition we have implemented flexible teleworking policy for employee who can meet our customer commitment remotely and significant portion of our workforce is currently teleworking it remains uncertain when and on what scale teleworking employee will return to work in person we have not previously experienced such significant portion of our workforce working remotely for prolonged period so it effect on our long term operation are unknown coronavirus related cost for and our supplier are significant and we are seeking reimbursement of coronavirus related cost under our government contract through combination of equitable adjustment to the contract price and reimbursement of the cost under section of the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act care act which allows federal agency to reimburse contractor at the minimum applicable contract billing rate for cost arising from certain paid leave including sick leave contractor provides to keep it employee or subcontractor in ready state well to protect the life and safety of government and contractor personnel from march through march reimbursement of any cost under section of the care act increase sale but is not expected to be at profit or fee and so would have the effect of reducing our margin in future period these cost increase including cost for employee whose job can not be performed remotely and for certain cost incurred prior to march may not be fully recoverable under our contract particularly fixed price contract or adequately covered by insurance we also have no assurance that congress will appropriate fund to cover the reimbursement of defense contractor authorized by the care act which could reduce fund available for other government defense priority we also deferred certain payroll tax in provided for in the care act which ha the effect of increasing our cash from operation in but reducing cash from operation in and we continue to work with our customer employee supplier and community to address the impact of covid and to take action in an effort to mitigate adverse consequence of content financial trendswe expect our net sale to increase by approximately from level the projected growth is driven by increase across all four business area specifically the increased growth is driven by and classified program at aeronautics increased volume within integrated air and missile defense at mfc increased

assumes that there will not be significant reduction in customer budget change in funding priority and that the government will not operate under continuing resolution for an extended period in which new contract and program start are restricted change in circumstance may require to revise our assumption which could materially change our current estimate of net sale operating margin and cash flow we expect total net fa ca pension benefit of approximately billion in based on discount rate basis point decrease from the end of an approximate return on plan asset in and expected long term rate of

approximately billion of ca pension cost portfolio shaping activity we continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of product and service to meet the current and future need of our customer we accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activity and through acquisition divestiture and internal realignment activity we selectively pursue the acquisition of business and

meet our need or strategy or that could perform better outside of our organization in pursuing our business strategy we routinely conduct discussion evaluate target and enter into agreement regarding possible acquisition divestiture joint venture and equity investment acquisitionson december we entered into an agreement to acquire aerojet rocketdyne holding inc aerojet rocketdyne for per share in cash which is expected to be reduced to per share after aerojet rocketdyne pay pre closing special dividend to it stockholder on march this represents post dividend equity value of approximately billion on fully diluted converted basis and transaction value of approximately billion after the assumption of aerojet rocketdyne projected net cash balance we expect to finance the acquisition through combination of cash on hand and new debt issuance the acquisition provides the corporation the opportunity to integrate aerojet rocketdyne propulsion system more effectively into it product generate cost and revenue synergy and improve efficiency in aerojet rocketdyne production operation the transaction will also allow customer incorporating aerojet rocketdyne product to offer more

current inventory objective of aircraft for the air force marine corp and navy commitment from our seven international partner country and six international customer well expression of interest from other country during the program completed several milestone both domestically and internationally the government continued testing the aircraft including ship trial mission and weapon system evaluation and the fleet recently surpassed flight hour during the second half of the government awarded the production of block buy aircraft in addition to the aircraft previously awarded since program inception we have delivered production aircraft demonstrating the program continued progress and longevity the first aircraft delivered to and international customer include variant variant and variant during we delivered production aircraft to our and international partner country and we have production aircraft in backlog including order from our international partner country in response to covid supplier delay and in conjunction with the joint program office we have tapered our production rate and we anticipate resuming pre covid production rate in the delay resulted in fewer delivery than originally planned in see the discussion in business overview covid and item risk factor result of turkey accepting delivery of the russian air and missile defense system the government removed turkey from the program in and in december imposed sanction on turkey defense procurement agency ssb and certain of the agency officer under the countering america adversary through sanction act caatsa the primary sanction imposed wa restriction on all new export license and authorization for any good or technology transferred to the ssb but doe not apply to current valid export license and authorization lockheed martin expects the government to continue to engage turkey on these issue but we have no indication that the sanction will be removed that additional sanction will not be imposed or that turkey will not issue reciprocal sanction while we do not expect the current sanction to have material effect on our current program additional sanction reciprocal sanction or other action could be material to our operation operating result financial position or cash flow in addition to having committed to purchase up to aircraft six of which had completed production at the time of removal turkish supplier continue to produce component part for the program some of which are single sourced to minimize the risk of disruption of our supply chain and ensure continuity of production we have been working closely with the dod and supporting activity to identify and engage alternate supplier for the component part produced by turkish supplier we have made significant progress transitioning to non turkish supplier but due to the procedure to qualify new part and supplier this collaborative process between dod and lockheed martin is ongoing during the dod publicly confirmed that turkish supplier would be permitted to provide certain component for the through while the transition timeline is an important first step it is equally important that our replacement capacity is re established so that production is not impacted effort to date have significantly reduced our risk but final resolution on limited number of remaining component could affect delivery and any accelerated work stoppage would impact cost we will continue to follow official government guidance it relates to completed turkish aircraft and the export and import of component part from the turkish supply chain the effect on the program of the government sanction on the ssb and turkey removal from the program do not appear to be significant at this time however unforeseen action could impact the timing of order disrupt the production of aircraft delay delivery of aircraft disrupt delivery of sustainment component produced in turkey and impact funding on the program to include the result of any reprogramming of fund that may be necessary to mitigate the impact of alternate source for component part made in turkey while in the case of the program we expect that these cost ultimately would be recovered from the government the availability or timing of any recovery could adversely affect our cash flow and result of operation for additional discussion including the risk of sanction on other program involving sale to turkey or work with turkish industry see item risk factor given the size and complexity of the program we anticipate that there will be continual review

currently and requires taxpayer to amortize them over five year while it is possible that congress may modify or repeal this provision before it take effect and we continue to have ongoing discussion with member of congress both on our own and with other industry through coalition we have no assurance that these provision will be modified or repealed furthermore we are continuing to work with our advisor to refine our legal interpretation of this provision prior to implementation in if these provision are not repealed and based on current interpretation of the law initially this would materially decrease our cash from operation based on current assumption beginning in by approximately billion and increase our net deferred tax asset by similar amount the largest impact would be on cash from operation which would depend on the amount of research and development expense paid or incurred in and other factor the impact however would continue over the five year amortization period but would decrease over the period and be immaterial in year six the amount of net deferred tax asset will change periodically based on several factor including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligation actual cash contribution to our postretirement benefit plan and future change in tax law in addition we are regularly under audit or examination by tax authority including

backlog wa approximately billion and billion at december and these amount included both funded backlog firm order for which funding ha been both authorized and appropriated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm order for which funding ha not yet been appropriated backlog doe not include unexercised option or task order to be issued under indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract funded backlog wa approximately billion at december compared to billion at december if any of our contract with firm order were to be terminated our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the unfilled order of such contract management evaluates performance on our contract by focusing on net sale and operating profit and not by type or amount of operating expense consequently our discussion of business segment performance focus on net sale and operating profit consistent with our approach for managing the business this approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contract management ass the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sale and operating profit and monitor performance on our contract in similar manner through their completion we regularly provide customer with report of our cost the contract progress the cost information in the report is accumulated in manner specified by the requirement of each contract for example cost data provided to customer for product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product such wing box on an aircraft and for service would align to the type of work being performed such aircraft sustainment our contract generally allow for the recovery of cost in the pricing of our product and service most of our contract are bid and negotiated with our customer under circumstance in which we are required to disclose our estimated total cost to provide the product or service this approach for negotiating contract with our government customer generally allows for recovery of our actual cost plus reasonable profit margin we also may enter into long term supply contract for certain material or component to coincide with the production schedule of certain product and to ensure their availability at known unit price many of our contract span several year and include highly complex technical requirement at the outset of contract we identify and monitor risk to the achievement of the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract and ass the effect of those risk on our estimate of total cost to complete the contract the estimate consider the technical requirement newly developed product versus mature product the schedule and associated task the number and type of milestone event and cost material labor subcontractor overhead and the estimated cost to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreement sometimes referred to offset agreement required under certain contract with international customer the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risk surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirement schedule and cost in the initial estimated total cost to complete the contract profit booking rate may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risk surrounding the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract which decrease the estimated total cost to complete the contract conversely our profit booking rate may decrease if the estimated total cost to complete the contract increase all of the estimate are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate we have number of program that are designated classified by the government which can not be specifically described the operating result of these classified program are included in our consolidated and business segment result and are subjected to the same oversight and internal control our other program our net sale are primarily derived from long term contract for product and service provided to the government well fm contracted through the government we recognize revenue performance obligation are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the product and service for performance obligation to deliver product with continuous transfer of control to the customer revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation generally using the percentage of completion cost to cost measure of progress for our contract because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer we incur cost on our contract for performance obligation in which control doe not continuously transfer to the customer we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied of content change in net sale and operating profit generally are expressed in term of volume change in volume refer to increase or decrease in sale or operating profit resulting from varying production activity level delivery or service level on individual contract volume change in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for particular contract in addition comparability of our segment sale operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by change in profit booking rate on our contract for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage of completion cost to cost method to measure progress towards completion increase in the profit booking rate typically referred to risk retirement usually relate to revision in the estimated total cost to fulfill the performance obligation that reflect improved condition on particular contract conversely condition on particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated total cost to fulfill the performance obligation and reduction in the profit booking rate increase or decrease in profit booking rate are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception to date effect of such change segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other item which may or may not impact sale favorable item may include the positive resolution of contractual matter cost recovery on severance and restructuring charge insurance recovery and gain on sale of asset unfavorable item may include the adverse resolution of contractual matter restructuring charge except for significant severance action which are excluded from segment operating result reserve for dispute certain asset impairment and loss on sale of certain asset previously disclosed we are responsible for program to design develop and construct ground based radar at our rms business segment the program ha experienced performance issue

of december we had cash balance of billion and no commercial paper borrowing outstanding under our billion revolving credit facility the credit facility which is also available for borrowing in the event of lack of short term commercial paper availability to date the effect of covid have not had significant negative impact on our liquidity cash flow or capital resource action taken by the government to increase the rate of progress payment had the effect of increasing our cash from operation but we used all of this benefit to accelerate payment to our supplier the effect of covid have at time led to disruption and volatility in the global capital market which depending on future of content development could impact our capital resource and liquidity in the future the economic impact of covid have also caused volatility in the equity capital market and investment return on our pension asset change in return on plan asset may affect our plan funding cash flow and stockholder equity difference between the actual plan asset return and the expected long term rate of return on plan asset of december impact the measurement of the following year financial accounting standard fa pension expense and pension funding requirement cash received from customer either from the payment of invoice for work performed or for advance from non government customer in excess of cost incurred is our primary source of cash we generally do not begin work on contract until funding is appropriated by the customer however we may determine to fund customer program pending government appropriation if we incur cost in excess of fund obligated on the contract we may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess cost billing timetable and payment term on our contract vary based on number of factor including the contract type we generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost reimbursable contract which represented approximately of the sale we recorded in we are authorized to bill the cost are incurred number of our fixed price contract may provide for performance based payment which allow to bill and collect cash we perform on the contract the amount of performance based payment and the related milestone are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract the timing of such payment may differ from the timing of the cost incurred related to our contract performance thereby affecting our cash flow the government ha indicated that it would consider progress payment the baseline for negotiating payment term on fixed price contract rather than performance based payment in contrast to negotiated performance based payment term progress payment provision correspond to percentage of the amount of cost incurred during the performance of the contract our cash flow may be affected if the government decides to withhold payment on our billing while the impact of withholding payment delay the receipt of cash the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract will not vary we have balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunity when

from customer and the guarantee of future performance on certain contract letter of credit and surety bond generally are available for draw in the event we do not perform in some case we may guarantee the contractual performance of third party such joint venture partner at december we had the following outstanding letter of credit surety bond and third party guarantee in million commitment expiration by periodtotal commitmentless year and and year standby letter of credit surety third party total commitment approximately million of standby letter of credit in the le than year category million in the year and category and million in the year and category are expected to renew for additional period until completion of the contractual obligation at december third party guarantee totaled million of which approximately related to guarantee of contractual performance of joint venture to which we currently are or previously were party these amount represent our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non performance of the joint venture joint venture partner or divested business generally we also have cross indemnity in place that may enable to recover amount that may be paid on behalf of joint venture partner in determining our exposure we evaluate the reputation performance on contractual obligation technical capability and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partner and the transferee under novation agreement all of which include guarantee required by the far at december and there were no material amount recorded in our financial statement related to third party guarantee or novation agreement critical accounting policiescontract accounting sale recognitionthe majority of our net sale are generated from long term contract with the government and international customer including fm contracted through the government for the research design development manufacture integration and sustainment of advanced technology system product and service we account for contract when it ha approval and commitment from both party the right of the party are identified payment term are identified the contract ha commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable for certain contract that meet the foregoing requirement primarily international direct commercial sale contract we are required to obtain certain regulatory approval in these case we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approval based upon all known fact and circumstance we provide our product and service under fixed price and cost reimbursable contract under fixed price contract we agree to perform the specified work for pre determined price to the extent our actual cost vary from the estimate upon which the price wa negotiated we will generate more or le profit or could incur loss some fixed price contract have performance based component under which we may earn incentive payment or incur financial penalty based on our performance cost reimbursable contract provide for the payment of allowable cost incurred during performance of the contract plus fee up to ceiling based on the amount that ha been funded typically we enter into three type of cost reimbursable contract cost plus award fee cost plus incentive fee and cost plus fixed fee cost plus award fee contract provide for an award fee that varies within specified limit based on the customer assessment of our performance against predetermined set of criterion such target based on cost quality technical and schedule criterion cost plus incentive fee contract provide for reimbursement of cost plus fee which is adjusted by formula based on the relationship of total allowable cost to total target cost incentive based on cost or reimbursement of cost plus an incentive to exceed stated performance target incentive based on performance the fixed fee in cost plus fixed fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed fee doe not vary with actual cost we ass each contract at it inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contract when making this determination we consider factor such whether two or more contract were negotiated and executed at or near the same of content time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective if combined we treat the combined contract single contract for revenue recognition purpose we evaluate the product or service promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for having one or more performance obligation the product and service in our contract are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationship and the significant contract management function required to perform under the contract accordingly our contract are typically accounted for one performance obligation in limited case our contract have more than one distinct performance obligation which occurs when we perform activity that are not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles significant judgment is required in determining performance obligation and these decision could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in given period we classify net sale product or service on our consolidated statement of earnings based on the predominant attribute of the performance obligation we determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the product or service being provided under the contract for contract where portion of the price may vary we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount which is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur we analyze the risk of significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk at the inception of contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current right and do not contemplate future modification including unexercised option or follow on contract until they become legally enforceable contract are often subsequently modified to include change in specification requirement or price which may create new or change existing enforceable right and obligation depending on the nature of the modification we consider whether to account for the modification an adjustment to the existing contract or separate contract generally modification to our contract are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated task provided in the context of the contract therefore such modification are accounted for if they were part of the existing contract and recognized cumulative adjustment to revenue for contract with multiple performance obligation we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation the standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to customer on standalone basis not bundled with any other product or service our contract with the government including fm contract are subject to far and the price is typically based on estimated or actual cost plus reasonable profit margin result of these regulation the standalone selling price of product or service in our contract with the government and fm contract are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract for non government contract with multiple performance obligation we evaluate whether the stated selling price for the product or service represent their standalone selling price we primarily sell customized solution unique to customer specification when it is necessary to allocate the transaction price to multiple performance obligation we typically use the expected cost plus reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service we occasionally sell standard product or service with observable standalone sale transaction in these situation the observable standalone sale transaction are used to determine the standalone selling price we recognize revenue performance obligation are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the product and service in determining when performance obligation are satisfied we consider factor such contract term payment term and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfer continuously to the customer for most contract with the government and fm contract this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clause in the contract that give the customer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience and pay for cost incurred plus reasonable profit for most non government contract primarily international direct commercial contract continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we deliver product that do not have an alternative use to and if our customer were to terminate the contract for reason other than our non performance we would have the right to recover damage which would include among other potential damage the right to payment for our work performed to date plus reasonable profit for performance obligation to deliver product with continuous transfer of control to the customer revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation generally using the percentage of completion cost to cost measure of progress for our contract because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer we incur cost on our contract under the percentage of completion cost to cost measure of progress the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of cost incurred to date to the total estimated cost to complete the of content performance obligation for performance obligation to provide service to the customer revenue is recognized over time based on cost incurred or the right to invoice method in situation where the value transferred match our billing right our customer receives and consumes the benefit for performance obligation in which control doe not continuously transfer to the customer we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied this coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point significant estimate and assumption are made in estimating contract sale and cost including the profit booking rate at the outset of long term contract we identify and monitor risk to the achievement of the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract well variable consideration and ass the effect of those risk on our estimate of sale and total cost to complete the contract the estimate consider the technical requirement newly developed product versus mature product the schedule and associated task the number and type of milestone event and cost material labor subcontractor overhead general and administrative and the estimated cost to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreement sometimes referred to offset or localization agreement required under certain contract with international customer the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risk surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirement schedule and cost in the initial estimated total cost to complete the contract profit booking rate may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risk surrounding the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract which decrease the estimated total cost to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract conversely our profit booking rate may decrease if the estimated total cost to complete the contract increase or our estimate of variable consideration we expect to receive decrease all of the estimate are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate when estimate of total cost to be incurred on contract exceed total estimate of the transaction price provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined comparability of our segment sale operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by change in profit booking rate on our contract for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage of completion cost to cost method to measure progress towards completion increase in the profit booking rate typically referred to risk retirement usually relate to revision in the estimated total cost to fulfill the performance obligation that reflect improved condition on particular contract conversely condition on particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated total cost to fulfill the performance obligation and reduction in the profit booking rate increase or decrease in profit booking rate are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception to date effect of such change segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other item which may or may not impact sale favorable item may include the positive resolution of contractual matter cost recovery on severance and restructuring charge insurance recovery and gain on sale of asset unfavorable item may include the adverse resolution of contractual matter restructuring charge except for significant severance action which are excluded from segment operating result reserve for dispute certain asset impairment and loss on sale of certain asset other contract accounting considerationsthe majority of our sale are driven by pricing based on cost incurred to produce product or perform service under contract with the government cost based pricing is determined under the far the far provides guidance on the type of cost that are allowable in establishing price for good and service under government contract for example cost such those related to charitable contribution interest expense and certain advertising and public relation activity are unallowable and therefore not recoverable through sale in addition we may enter into advance agreement with the government that address the subject of allowability and allocability of cost to contract for specific matter for example most of the environmental cost we incur for environmental remediation related to site operated in prior year are allocated to our current operation general and administrative cost under far provision and supporting advance agreement reached with the government we closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policy related to contract accounting cost incurred and allocated to contract are reviewed for compliance with government regulation by our personnel and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency of content postretirement benefit plansoverviewmany of our employee and retiree participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plan retiree medical and life insurance plan and other postemployment plan collectively postretirement benefit plan see note postretirement benefit plan included in our note to consolidated financial statement the majority of our accrued benefit obligation relate to our qualified defined benefit pension plan and retiree medical and life insurance plan we recognize on plan by plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plan under gaap either an asset or liability on our consolidated balance sheet the gaap funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan asset and the benefit obligation of the plan the gaap benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefit we currently expect to pay to plan participant based on past service we completed the final step of the previously announced planned freeze of our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plan for salaried employee effective january the freeze took effect in two stage effective january the pay based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefit wa frozen effective january the service based component of the formula wa frozen result of these change the qualified defined benefit pension plan for salaried employee are fully frozen effective january with the freeze complete the majority of our salaried employee participate in an enhanced defined contribution retirement saving plan similar to recent year we continue to take action to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plan on our financial result by reducing the volatility of our pension obligation including entering into additional transaction involving the purchase of group annuity contract for portion of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligation using asset from the pension trust during december lockheed martin through it master retirement trust purchased an irrevocable group annuity contract from an insurance company referred to buy out contract for billion to transfer the related outstanding defined benefit pension obligation result of this transaction we were relieved of all responsibility for these pension obligation and the insurance company is required to pay and administer the retirement benefit owed to approximately retiree and beneficiary with no change to the amount timing or form of monthly retirement benefit payment although the transaction wa treated settlement for accounting purpose we did not recognize loss on the settlement in earnings associated with the transaction because total settlement during for the affected pension plan were le than the plan service and interest cost in second contract wa also purchased from an insurance company for million that will reimburse the plan for all future benefit payment related to approximately retiree and beneficiary referred to buy in contract the covered retiree and beneficiary and buy in contract were spun off to the plan established in december for the contract purchased at that time similarly structured buy in the buy in contract are the sole asset of that plan under the arrangement the plan remains responsible for paying the benefit for the covered retiree and beneficiary and the insurance company will reimburse the plan those benefit are paid result there is no net ongoing cash flow to the plan for the covered retiree and beneficiary the cost of providing the benefit is funded by the buy in contract effectively locking in the cost of the benefit and eliminating future volatility of the benefit obligation while also providing the option to convert to buy out the buy in contract wa purchased using asset from the pension trust and is accounted for at fair value an investment of the trust these transaction had no impact on our fa pension expense or ca pension cost since december lockheed martin through it master retirement trust ha purchased total contract both buy in and buy out for approximately billion related to our outstanding defined benefit pension obligation eliminating pension plan volatility for approximately retiree and beneficiary and annually required pension benefit guarantee corporation pbgc premium of approximately million per year we expect to continue to look for opportunity to manage our pension liability through additional buy out and buy in contract in future year future transaction could result in non cash settlement charge to earnings which could be material to reporting period notwithstanding these action the impact of our postretirement benefit plan on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plan may materially change from year to year because the calculation are sensitive to funding level well change in several key economic assumption including interest rate actual rate of return on plan asset and other actuarial assumption including participant longevity and employee turnover well the timing of cash funding of content actuarial assumptionsthe plan asset and benefit obligation are measured at the end of each year or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain event such significant plan amendment settlement or curtailment the amount we record are measured using actuarial valuation which are dependent upon key assumption such discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan asset participant longevity employee turnover and the health care cost trend rate for our retiree medical plan the assumption we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligation of the measurement date and the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in subsequent period when reassessing these assumption we consider past and current market condition and make judgment about future market trend we also consider factor such the timing and amount of expected contribution to the plan and benefit payment to plan participant we continue to use single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligation related to our defined benefit pension plan resulting in at december compared to at december we utilized single weighted average discount rate of when calculating our benefit obligation related to our retiree medical and life insurance plan at december compared to at december we evaluate several data point in order to arrive at an appropriate single weighted average discount rate including result from cash flow model quoted rate from long term bond index and change in long term bond rate over the past year part of our evaluation we calculate the approximate average yield on corporate bond rated aa or better selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flow the decrease in the discount rate from december to december resulted in an increase in the projected benefit obligation of our qualified defined benefit pension plan of approximately billion at december we utilized an expected long term rate of return on plan asset of at both december and december the long term rate of return assumption represents the expected long term rate of return on the fund invested or to be invested to provide for the benefit included in the benefit obligation this assumption is based on several factor including historical market index return the anticipated long term allocation of plan asset the historical return data for the trust fund plan expense and the potential to outperform market index return the difference between the long term rate of return on plan asset assumption we select and the actual return on plan asset in any given year affect both the funded status of our benefit plan and the calculation of fa pension expense in subsequent period although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption the average expected return over long term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption any variance each year should not by suggest that the assumption should be changed pattern of variance are reviewed over time and then combined with expectation for the future result change in this assumption are le frequent than change in the discount rate the actual investment return for our qualified defined benefit plan during of billion based on an actual rate of approximately improved plan asset more than the billion expected return based on our long term rate of return assumption in october the society of actuary published revised longevity assumption that refined it prior study we used the revised assumption in our december re measurement of benefit obligation resulting in an approximate million decrease in the projected benefit obligation of our qualified defined benefit pension plan our stockholder equity ha been reduced cumulatively by billion from the annual year end measurement of the funded status of postretirement benefit plan the cumulative non cash after tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial loss resulting from decline in discount rate investment loss and updated longevity market related value of our plan asset determined using actual asset gain or loss over the prior three year period is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gain or loss to be amortized these cumulative actuarial loss will be amortized to expense using the corridor method where gain and loss are recognized to the extent they exceed of the greater of plan asset or benefit obligation over an average period of approximately twenty year of december this amortization period extended in due to the freeze of our salaried pension plan to use the average remaining life expectancy of the participant instead of average future service during million of these amount were recognized component of postretirement benefit plan expense the discount rate and long term rate of return on plan asset assumption we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimate and judgment change of plus or minus basis point in the discount rate assumption at december with all other assumption held constant would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of by approximately billion which would result in an after tax increase or decrease in stockholder equity at the end of the year of approximately billion if the discount rate at december that wa used to compute the expected fa pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plan had been basis point higher or lower with all other assumption held constant the amount of fa pension expense projected for would be lower or higher by approximately million the impact of change in the discount rate on fa pension expense is significantly le than in year prior to the freeze of our salaried pension plan effective january due to the resulting service cost reduction and extended loss amortization period discussed above if the expected long term rate of of content return on plan asset assumption at december that wa used to compute the expected fa pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plan had been basis point higher or lower with all other assumption held constant the amount of fa pension expense projected for would be lower or higher by approximately million each year difference between the actual plan asset return and the expected long term rate of return on plan asset impact the measurement of the following year fa expense every basis point difference in return during between our actual rate of return of approximately and our expected long term rate of return of impacted expected fa pension expense by approximately million funding considerationswe made contribution of billion in both and to our qualified defined benefit pension plan funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plan is determined in manner consistent with ca and in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of erisa amended by the pension protection act of ppa our goal ha been to fund the pension plan to level of at least determined under the ppa the erisa funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plan wa approximately and of december and which is calculated on different basis than under gaap contribution to our defined benefit pension plan are recovered over time through the pricing of our product and service on government contract including fm and are recognized in our cost of sale and net sale ca govern the extent to which our pension cost are allocable to and recoverable under contract with the government including fm pension cost recovery under ca occur in different period from when pension contribution are made under the ppa the ca rule fully transitioned in to better align the recovery of pension cost with the minimum funding requirement of the ppa referred to ca harmonization we recovered billion in and billion in ca pension cost amount contributed in excess of the ca pension cost recovered under government contract are considered to be prepayment credit under the ca rule our prepayment credit were approximately billion and billion at december and respectively the prepayment credit balance will increase or decrease based on our actual investment return on plan asset trendswe plan to make discretionary contribution of approximately billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in we anticipate recovering approximately billion of ca pension cost in allowing to recoup portion of our ca prepayment credit we project fa pension income of million in compared to fa pension income of million in and net fa ca pension benefit of billion compared to billion in environmental matterswe are party to various agreement proceeding and potential proceeding for environmental remediation issue including matter at various site where we have been designated potentially responsible party prp at december and the total amount of liability recorded on our consolidated balance sheet for environmental matter wa million and million we have recorded asset totaling million and million at december and for the portion of environmental cost that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our product and service for agency of the government discussed below the amount that is expected to be allocated to our non government contract or that is determined to not be recoverable under government contract is expensed through cost of sale we project cost and recovery of cost over approximately year we enter into agreement administrative consent order consent decree that document the extent and timing of some of our environmental remediation obligation we also are involved in environmental remediation activity at site where formal agreement either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation environmental remediation activity usually span many year which make estimating the cost more judgmental due to for example changing remediation technology to determine the cost related to clean up site we have to ass the extent of contamination effect on natural resource the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation and evolving environmental standard we perform quarterly review of environmental remediation site and record liability and receivables in the period it becomes probable that the liability have been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated see the discussion under environmental matter in note significant accounting policy and note legal proceeding commitment and of content contingency included in our note to consolidated financial statement we consider the above factor in our quarterly estimate of the timing and amount of any future cost that may be required for environmental remediation activity which result in the calculation of range of estimate for each particular environmental remediation site we do not discount the recorded liability the amount and timing of future cash payment are not fixed or can not be reliably determined given the required level of judgment and estimation it is likely that materially different amount could be recorded if different assumption were used or if circumstance were to change change in environmental standard or change in our estimate of the extent of contamination under agreement reached with the government most of the amount we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operation general and administrative cost under existing government regulation these and other environmental expenditure relating to our government business after deducting any recovery received from insurance or other prps are allowable in establishing price of our product and service result most of the expenditure we incur are included in our net sale and cost of sale according to government agreement or regulation regardless of the contract form cost reimbursable fixed price we continually evaluate the recoverability of our asset for the portion of environmental cost that are probable of future recovery by assessing among other factor government regulation our government business base and contract mix our history of receiving reimbursement of such cost and effort by some government representative to limit such reimbursement in addition to the proceeding and potential proceeding discussed above the california state water resource control board branch of the california environmental protection agency ha indicated it will work to re establish maximum level of the contaminant hexavalent chromium in drinking water after prior standard of part per billion ppb wa challenged and withdrawn and is also reevaluating it existing drinking water standard of ppb for perchlorate the environmental protection agency decided in june not to regulate perchlorate in drinking water at the federal level although this decision ha been challenged and is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium if substantially lower standard are adopted for perchlorate in california or for hexavalent chromium in california or at the federal level we expect material increase in our estimate for environmental liability and the related asset for the portion of the increased cost that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our product and service for the government the amount that would be allocable to our non government contract or that is determined not to be recoverable under government contract would be expensed which may have material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period we also are evaluating the potential impact of existing and contemplated legal requirement addressing class of compound known generally per and polyfluoroalkyl compound pfas pfas compound have been used ubiquitously such in fire fighting foam manufacturing process and stain and stick resistant product teflon stain resistant fabric because we have used product and process over the year containing some of those compound they likely exist contaminant at many of our environmental remediation site governmental authority have announced plan and in some instance have begun to regulate certain of these compound at extremely low concentration in drinking water which could lead to increased cleanup cost at many of our environmental remediation site disclosed above we may record change in the amount of environmental remediation liability result of our quarterly review of the status of our environmental remediation site which would result in change to the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery and charge to earnings for example if we were to determine that the liability should be increased by million the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery would be increased by approximately million with the remainder recorded charge to earnings this allocation is determined annually based upon our existing and projected business activity with the government we can not reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental remediation site with which we are involved there are number of former operating facility we are monitoring or investigating for potential future environmental remediation in some case although loss may be probable it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activity because of uncertainty assessing the extent of the contamination during any particular quarter such uncertainty may be resolved allowing to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate particular former operating site the amount of the liability could be material upon recognition of the liability portion will be recognized receivable with the remainder charged to earnings which may have material effect in any particular interim reporting period if we are ultimately found to have liability at those site where we have been designated prp we expect that the actual cost of environmental remediation will be shared with other liable prps generally prps that are ultimately determined to be responsible party are strictly liable for site remediation and usually agree among to share on an allocated basis the cost and expense for environmental investigation and remediation under existing environmental law responsible party are of content jointly and severally liable and therefore we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation in the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation the statutory framework provides that we may pursue right of cost recovery or contribution from the other prps the amount we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental cost we have incurred through insurance or from other prps which we are required to pursue by agreement and government regulation goodwill and intangible assetsthe asset and liability of acquired business are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill represents cost in excess of fair value assigned to the underlying identifiable net asset of acquired business intangible asset from acquired business are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and consist of customer program trademark customer relationship technology and other intangible asset customer program include value assigned to major program of acquired business and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationship contract technology and trademark underlying the associated program and are amortized on straight line basis over period of expected cash flow used to measure fair value which range from nine to year our goodwill balance wa billion at december and billion at december we perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired such event or change in circumstance may include significant deterioration in overall economic condition change in the business climate of our industry decline in our market capitalization operating performance indicator competition reorganization of our business government budget restriction or the disposal of all or portion of reporting unit our goodwill ha been allocated to and is tested for impairment at level referred to the reporting unit which is our business segment level or level below the business segment the level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires to determine whether the operation below the business segment constitute self sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly review the operating result we may use both qualitative and quantitative approach when testing goodwill for impairment for selected reporting unit where we use the qualitative approach we perform qualitative evaluation of event and circumstance impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment based on that qualitative evaluation if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying amount no further evaluation is necessary otherwise we perform quantitative impairment test we perform quantitative test for most reporting unit at least every three year however for certain reporting unit we may perform quantitative impairment test every year to perform the quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of reporting unit to it carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds it fair value goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess we generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using combination of discounted cash flow dcf analysis and market based valuation methodology such comparable public company trading value and value observed in recent business acquisition determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including the amount and timing of expected future cash flow long term growth rate discount rate and relevant comparable public company earnings multiple and relevant transaction multiple the cash flow employed in the dcf analysis are based on our best estimate of future sale earnings and cash flow after considering factor such general market condition government budget existing firm order expected future order contract with supplier labor agreement change in working capital long term business plan and recent operating performance the discount rate utilized in the dcf analysis are based on the respective reporting unit weighted average cost of capital which take into account the relative weight of each component of capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flow of the respective reporting unit the carrying value of each reporting unit includes the asset and liability employed in it operation goodwill and allocation of amount held at the business segment and corporate level in the fourth quarter of we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting unit the result of that test indicated that for each of our reporting unit no impairment existed of the date of our annual impairment test the fair value of our sikorsky reporting unit exceeded it carrying value which included goodwill of billion by margin of approximately the fair value of our sikorsky reporting unit can be significantly impacted by change in expected future order general market pressure including government budgetary constraint discount rate long term growth rate and change in federal or state or foreign tax law and regulation or their interpretation and application including those with retroactive effect along with other significant judgment based on our assessment of these circumstance we have determined that goodwill at our sikorsky reporting unit is at risk for impairment should there be deterioration of projected cash flow of the reporting unit of content impairment assessment inherently involve management judgment regarding number of assumption such those described above due to the many variable inherent in the estimation of reporting unit fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill difference in assumption could have material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting unit and could result in goodwill impairment charge in future period acquired intangible asset deemed to have indefinite life are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing this testing compare carrying value to fair value and when appropriate the carrying value of these asset is reduced to fair value in the fourth quarter of we performed our annual impairment test and the result of that test indicated no impairment existed finite lived intangible are amortized to expense over the applicable useful life ranging from three to year based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit reflected by future net cash inflow we perform an impairment test of finite lived intangible whenever event or change in circumstance indicate their carrying value may be impaired if event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of finite lived intangible may be impaired the sum of the undiscounted future cash flow expected to result from the use of the asset group would be compared to the asset group carrying value if the asset group carrying amount exceed the sum of the undiscounted future cash flow we would determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment loss in net earnings recent accounting pronouncementssee note significant accounting policy included in our note to consolidated financial statement under the caption recent accounting pronouncement of content item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskwe maintain active relationship with broad and diverse group of and international financial institution we believe that they provide with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business we continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse development with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of and access to sufficient credit resource our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and market price on certain equity security our financial instrument that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed rate long term debt and commercial paper if issued the estimated fair value of our outstanding debt wa billion at december and the outstanding principal amount wa billion excluding unamortized discount and issuance cost of billion change in the level of interest rate would not have material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at december we use derivative instrument principally to reduce our exposure to market risk from change in foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate we do not enter into or hold derivative instrument for speculative trading purpose we transact business globally and are subject to risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rate we enter into foreign currency hedge such forward and option contract that change in value foreign currency exchange rate change our most significant foreign currency exposure relate to the british pound sterling the euro the canadian dollar and the australian dollar these contract hedge forecasted foreign currency transaction in order to mitigate fluctuation in our earnings and cash flow associated with change in foreign currency exchange rate result we do not have material foreign currency transaction exposure including exposure to the pound sterling or euro should there be material foreign currency fluctuation due to the united kingdom departing from the european union commonly referred to brexit we designate foreign currency hedge cash flow hedge we also are exposed to the impact of interest rate change primarily through our borrowing activity for fixed rate borrowing we may use variable interest rate swap effectively converting fixed rate borrowing to variable rate borrowing in order to hedge change in the fair value of the debt these swap are designated fair value hedge for variable rate borrowing we may use fixed interest rate swap effectively converting variable rate borrowing to fixed rate borrowing in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate change on earnings these swap are designated cash flow hedge we also may enter into derivative instrument that are not designated hedge and do not qualify for hedge accounting which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposure the classification of gain and loss resulting from change in the fair value of derivative is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and it resulting designation adjustment to reflect change in fair value of derivative attributable to highly effective hedge are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustment to the hedged item or reflected net of income tax in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings change in the fair value of the derivative that are not highly effective if any are immediately recognized in earnings the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swap at december and wa million and million the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedge at december and wa billion and billion at december and the net fair value of our derivative instrument wa not material see note fair value measurement included in our note to consolidated financial statement unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contract would not have material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contract or our consolidated financial statement additionally we enter into foreign currency contract to hedge foreign currency exposure on underlying transaction we believe that any movement on our foreign currency contract would be offset by movement on the underlying transaction and therefore when taken together do not create material risk we evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transaction and only enter into agreement with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreement are executed our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several bank we periodically monitor change to counterparty credit quality well our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties we do not hold or issue derivative financial instrument for trading or speculative purpose we maintain separate trust that includes investment to fund certain of our non qualified deferred compensation plan of december investment in the trust totaled billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent asset the trust hold investment in marketable equity security and fixed income security that are exposed to price change and change in interest rate portion of the liability associated with the deferred compensation plan supported by the trust is also impacted by change in the market price of our common stock and certain market index change in the value of the liability have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of change in the value of the trust both the change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liability are recognized on our consolidated statement of earnings in other unallocated net

the risk of material misstatement of the financial statement whether due to error or fraud and performing procedure that respond to those risk such procedure included examining on test basis evidence regarding the amount and disclosure in the financial statement our audit also included evaluating the accounting principle used and significant estimate made by management well evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statement we believe that our audit provide reasonable basis for our opinion critical audit mattersthe critical audit matter communicated below are matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statement that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that relate to account or disclosure that are material to the

statement taken whole and we are not by communicating the critical audit matter below providing separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which they relate of content revenue recognition based on the percentage of completion methoddescription of the matterfor the year ended december the corporation recorded net sale of billion more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statement the corporation generates the majority of it net sale from long term contract with it customer whereby substantially all of the corporation revenue is recognized over time using the percentage of completion cost to cost measure of progress under the percentage of completion cost to cost measure of progress the corporation measure progress towards completion based on the ratio of cost incurred to date to the estimated total cost to complete the performance obligation referred to the estimate at completion analysis the corporation estimate profit on these contract the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost at completion the percentage of completion cost to cost method requires management to make significant estimate and assumption to estimate contract sale and cost associated with it contract with customer at the outset of long term contract the corporation identifies risk to the achievement of the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract throughout the contract life cycle the corporation monitor and ass the effect of those risk on it estimate of sale and total cost to complete the contract profit booking rate may increase during the performance of the contract if the corporation successfully retires risk surrounding the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract which would decrease the estimated total cost to complete the contract conversely the profit booking rate may decrease if the estimated total cost to complete the contract increase change to the profit booking rate resulting from change in estimate could have material effect on the corporation result of operation auditing the corporation estimate at completion analysis used in it revenue recognition process wa complex due to the judgment involved in evaluating the significant estimate and assumption made by management in the creation and subsequent update to the corporation estimate at completion analysis the estimate at completion analysis of each contract consider risk surrounding the corporation ability to achieve the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract how we addressed the matter in our auditwe obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of relevant internal control over the corporation revenue recognition process for example we tested internal control over management review of the estimate at completion analysis and the significant assumption underlying the estimated contract value and estimated total cost to complete we also tested internal control that management executes to validate the data used in the estimate at completion analysis wa complete and accurate to test the accuracy of the corporation estimate at completion analysis our audit procedure included among others comparing estimate of labor cost subcontractor cost and material to historical result of similar contract and agreeing the key term to contract documentation and management estimate we also performed sensitivity analysis over the significant assumption to evaluate the change in the profit booking rate resulting from change in the assumption goodwill impairment assessment sikorsky reporting unitdescription of the matterat december the corporation sikorsky reporting unit had goodwill balance of billion which represented approximately of total asset discussed in note and note to the consolidated financial statement goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level using either qualitative or quantitative approach under the quantitative approach to test for goodwill impairment the corporation compare the fair value of reporting unit to it carrying amount including goodwill generally the corporation estimate the fair value of it reporting unit using combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market based valuation methodology auditing management annual impairment test over the sikorsky reporting unit goodwill wa complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required in determining the fair value in particular the fair value estimate wa sensitive to significant assumption such revenue growth rate operating margin cash flow terminal value and weighted average cost of capital which are affected by expectation about future market or economic condition and expected future operating result of the sikorsky business of content how we addressed the matter in our auditwe obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of relevant internal control over the corporation goodwill impairment review including control over management review of the valuation model and significant assumption described above we also tested the internal control management executes to validate the data used in the valuation model wa complete and accurate to test the estimated fair value of the sikorsky reporting unit we performed audit procedure that included among others assessing the valuation methodology used by the corporation involving our valuation specialist to assist in testing the significant assumption described above that are used in the valuation and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data the corporation used in it analysis for example we compared the significant assumption to current industry market and economic trend historical result of the sikorsky business and other relevant factor we also performed sensitivity analysis over the significant assumption to evaluate the impact that change in significant assumption would have on the fair value of the reporting unit defined benefit pension plan obligationdescription of the matterat december the corporation aggregate obligation for it qualified defined benefit pension plan wa billion and exceeded the gross fair value of the related plan asset of billion resulting in net unfunded qualified defined benefit pension obligation of billion explained in note of the consolidated financial statement the corporation remeasures the qualified defined benefit pension asset and obligation at the end of each year or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain event the amount are measured using actuarial valuation which depend on key assumption such the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan asset and participant longevity auditing the defined benefit pension obligation wa complex and required the involvement of specialist result of the judgmental nature of the actuarial assumption such discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan asset and participant longevity used in the measurement process these assumption have significant effect on the projected benefit obligation with the discount rate being the most sensitive of those assumption how we addressed the matter in our auditwe obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of relevant internal control over management measurement and valuation of the defined benefit pension obligation calculation for example we tested the internal control over management review of the defined benefit pension obligation calculation the significant actuarial assumption and the data input provided to the actuary to test the defined benefit pension obligation our audit procedure included among others evaluating the methodology used the significant actuarial assumption described above and the underlying data used by the corporation we compared the actuarial assumption used by management to historical trend and evaluated the change in the defined benefit pension obligation from prior year due to the change in service cost interest cost benefit payment actuarial gain and loss contribution new longevity assumption and plan amendment in addition we involved our actuarial specialist to assist in evaluating management methodology for determining the discount rate that reflects the maturity and duration of the benefit payment and is used to measure the defined benefit pension obligation part of this assessment we compared the projected cash flow to prior year and compared the current year benefit paid to the prior year projected cash flow to evaluate the mortality rate and the longevity we evaluated management selection of mortality base table and improvement scale adjusted for entity specific factor we also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data including the participant data provided to the corporation actuarial specialist lastly to evaluate the expected return on plan asset we assessed whether management assumption wa consistent with range of return for portfolio of comparative investment ernst young llpwe

are attributable to long term contract or program in progress for which the related operating cycle are longer than one year in accordance with industry practice we include these item in current asset and current liability unless otherwise noted we present all per share amount cited in these consolidated financial statement on per diluted share basis use of estimate we prepare our consolidated financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle gaap in doing so we are required to make estimate and assumption that affect the amount reported in the consolidated financial statement and accompanying note we base these estimate on historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying amount of asset and liability that are not readily apparent from other source our actual result may differ materially from these estimate significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement include but are not limited to accounting for sale and cost recognition postretirement benefit plan asset for the portion of environmental cost that are probable of future recovery and liability evaluation of goodwill and other asset for impairment income tax including deferred income tax fair value measurement and contingency revenue recognition the majority of our net sale are generated from long term contract with the government and international customer including foreign military sale fm contracted through the government for the research design development manufacture integration and sustainment of advanced technology system product and service we account for contract when it ha approval and commitment from both party the right of the party are identified payment term are identified the contract ha commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable for certain contract that meet the foregoing requirement primarily international direct commercial sale contract we are required to obtain certain regulatory approval in these case we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approval based upon all known fact and circumstance we provide our product and service under fixed price and cost reimbursable contract under fixed price contract we agree to perform the specified work for pre determined price to the extent our actual cost vary from the estimate upon which the price wa negotiated we will generate more or le profit or could incur loss some fixed price contract have performance based component under which we may earn incentive payment or incur financial penalty based on our performance cost reimbursable contract provide for the payment of allowable cost incurred during performance of the contract plus fee up to ceiling based on the amount that ha been funded typically we enter into three type of cost reimbursable contract cost plus award fee cost plus incentive fee and cost plus fixed fee cost plus award fee contract provide for an award fee that varies within specified limit based on the customer assessment of our performance against predetermined set of criterion such target based on cost quality technical and schedule criterion cost plus incentive fee contract provide for reimbursement of cost plus fee which is adjusted by formula based on the relationship of total allowable cost to total target cost incentive based on cost or reimbursement of cost plus an incentive to exceed stated performance target incentive based on performance the fixed fee in cost plus fixed fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed fee doe not vary with actual cost we ass each contract at it inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contract when making this determination we consider factor such whether two or more contract were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective if combined we treat the combined contract single contract for revenue recognition purpose of content we evaluate the product or service promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for having one or more performance obligation the product and service in our contract are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationship and the significant contract management function required to perform under the contract accordingly our contract are typically accounted for one performance obligation in limited case our contract have more than one distinct performance obligation which occurs when we perform activity that are not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles significant judgment is required in determining performance obligation and these decision could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in given period we classify net sale product or service on our consolidated statement of earnings based on the predominant attribute of the performance obligation we determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the product or service being provided under the contract for contract where portion of the price may vary we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount which is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur we analyze the risk of significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk at the inception of contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current right and do not contemplate future modification including unexercised option or follow on contract until they become legally enforceable contract are often subsequently modified to include change in specification requirement or price which may create new or change existing enforceable right and obligation depending on the nature of the modification we consider whether to account for the modification an adjustment to the existing contract or separate contract generally modification to our contract are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated task provided in the context of the contract therefore such modification are accounted for if they were part of the existing contract and recognized cumulative adjustment to revenue for contract with multiple performance obligation we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation the standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to customer on standalone basis not bundled with any other product or service our contract with the government including fm contract are subject to the federal acquisition regulation far and the price is typically based on estimated or actual cost plus reasonable profit margin result of these regulation the standalone selling price of product or service in our contract with the government and fm contract are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract for non government contract with multiple performance obligation we evaluate whether the stated selling price for the product or service represent their standalone selling price we primarily sell customized solution unique to customer specification when it is necessary to allocate the transaction price to multiple performance obligation we typically use the expected cost plus reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service we occasionally sell standard product or service with observable standalone sale transaction in these situation the observable standalone sale transaction are used to determine the standalone selling price we recognize revenue performance obligation are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the product and service in determining when performance obligation are satisfied we consider factor such contract term payment term and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfer continuously to the customer for most contract with the government and fm contract this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clause in the contract that give the customer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience and pay for cost incurred plus reasonable profit for most non government contract primarily international direct commercial contract continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we deliver product that do not have an alternative use to and if our customer were to terminate the contract for reason other than our non performance we would have the right to recover damage which would include among other potential damage the right to payment for our work performed to date plus reasonable profit for performance obligation to deliver product with continuous transfer of control to the customer revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation generally using the percentage of completion cost to cost measure of progress for our contract because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer we incur cost on our contract under the percentage of completion cost to cost measure of progress the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of cost incurred to date to the total estimated cost to complete the performance obligation for performance obligation to provide service to the customer revenue is recognized over time based on cost incurred or the right to invoice method in situation where the value transferred match our billing right our customer receives and consumes the benefit of content for performance obligation in which control doe not continuously transfer to the customer we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied this coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point backlog unfulfilled or remaining performance obligation represents the sale we expect to recognize for our product and service for which control ha not yet transferred to the customer it is converted into sale in future period work is performed or delivery are made for our cost reimbursable and fixed priced incentive contract the estimated consideration we expect to receive pursuant to the term of the contract may exceed the contractual award amount the estimated consideration is determined at the outset of the contract and is continuously reviewed throughout the contract period in determining the estimated consideration we consider the risk related to the technical schedule and cost impact to complete the contract and an estimate of any variable consideration periodically we review these risk and may increase or decrease backlog accordingly the risk on such contract are successfully retired the estimated consideration from customer may be reduced resulting in reduction of backlog without corresponding recognition of sale of december our ending backlog wa billion we expect to recognize approximately of our backlog over the next month and approximately over the next month revenue with the remainder recognized thereafter for arrangement with the government and fm contract we generally do not begin work on contract until funding is appropriated by the customer billing timetable and payment term on our contract vary based on number of factor including the contract type typical payment term under fixed price contract with the government provide that the customer pay either performance based payment pbps based on the achievement of contract milestone or progress payment based on percentage of cost we incur for the majority of our international direct commercial contract to deliver complex system we typically receive advance payment prior to commencement of work well milestone payment that are paid in accordance with the term of our contract we perform we recognize liability for payment in excess of revenue recognized which is presented contract liability on the balance sheet the portion of payment retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer from our failure to adequately complete some or all of the obligation under the contract payment received from customer in advance of revenue recognition are not considered to be significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demand that can be higher in the early stage of contract for fixed price and cost reimbursable contract we present revenue recognized in excess of billing contract asset on the balance sheet amount billed and due from our customer under both contract type are classified receivables on the balance sheet significant estimate and assumption are made in estimating contract sale and cost including the profit booking rate at the outset of long term contract we identify and monitor risk to the achievement of the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract well variable consideration and ass the effect of those risk on our estimate of sale and total cost to complete the contract the estimate consider the technical requirement newly developed product versus mature product the schedule and associated task the number and type of milestone event and cost material labor subcontractor overhead general and administrative and the estimated cost to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreement sometimes referred to offset or localization agreement required under certain contract with international customer the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risk surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirement schedule and cost in the initial estimated total cost to complete the contract profit booking rate may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risk surrounding the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract which decrease the estimated total cost to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract conversely our profit booking rate may decrease if the estimated total cost to complete the contract increase or our estimate of variable consideration we expect to receive decrease all of the estimate are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate when estimate of total cost to be incurred on contract exceed total estimate of the transaction price provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined comparability of our segment sale operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by change in profit booking rate on our contract for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage of completion cost to cost method to measure progress towards completion increase in the profit booking rate typically referred to risk retirement usually relate to revision in the estimated total cost to fulfill the performance obligation that reflect improved condition on particular contract conversely condition on particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated total cost to fulfill the performance obligation and reduction in the profit booking rate increase or decrease in profit booking rate are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception to date effect of such change segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other item which may or may not impact sale of content favorable item may include the positive resolution of contractual matter cost recovery on severance and restructuring charge insurance recovery and gain on sale of asset unfavorable item may include the adverse resolution of contractual matter restructuring charge except for significant severance action which are excluded from segment operating result reserve for dispute certain asset impairment and loss on sale of certain asset our consolidated net adjustment not related to volume including net profit booking rate adjustment and other item increased segment operating profit by approximately billion in and billion in each of and these adjustment increased net earnings by approximately billion and per share in and we recognized net sale from performance obligation satisfied in prior period of approximately billion billion and billion in and which primarily relate to change in profit booking rate that impacted revenue previously disclosed we are responsible for program to design develop and construct ground based radar at our rms business segment the program ha experienced performance issue for which we have periodically accrued reserve of december cumulative loss were approximately million on this program we may continue to experience issue related to customer requirement and our performance under this contract and have to record additional charge however based on the loss previously recorded and our current estimate of the sale and cost to complete the program at this time we do not anticipate that additional loss if any would be material to our operating result or financial condition previously disclosed we have program eadge to design integrate and install an air missile defense command control communication computer intelligence system for an international customer that ha experienced performance issue and for which we have periodically accrued reserve at our rms business segment of december cumulative loss remained at approximately million we continue to monitor program requirement and our performance at this time we do not anticipate additional charge that would be material to our operating result or financial condition previously disclosed we are responsible for designing developing and installing an upgraded turret for the warrior capability sustainment program of december cumulative loss remained at approximately million on this program we may continue to experience issue related to customer requirement and our performance under this contract and may have to record additional reserve however based on the loss already recorded and our current estimate of the sale and cost to complete the program at this time we do not anticipate that additional loss if any would be material to our operating result or financial condition research and development and similar cost we conduct research and development activity using our own fund referred to company funded or independent research and development ir and under contractual arrangement with our customer referred to customer funded to enhance existing product and service and to develop future technology cost include basic research applied research concept formulation study design development and related test activity company funded cost are allocated to customer contract part of the general and administrative overhead cost and generally recoverable on our customer contract with the government customer funded cost are charged directly to the related customer contract substantially all cost are charged to cost of sale incurred company funded cost charged to cost of sale totaled billion in each of and stock based compensation compensation cost related to all share based payment is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award we generally recognize the compensation cost ratably over three year vesting period net of estimated forfeiture at each reporting date the number of share is adjusted to the number ultimately expected to vest income tax we calculate our provision for income tax using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax asset and liability are recognized based on the future tax consequence attributable to temporary difference that exist between the financial statement carrying amount of asset and liability and their respective tax base well from operating loss and tax credit carry forward we measure deferred tax asset and liability using enacted tax rate that will apply in the year in which we expect the temporary difference to be recovered or paid we periodically ass our tax exposure related to period that are open to examination based on the latest available information we evaluate our tax position to determine whether the position will more likely than not be sustained upon examination by the internal revenue service irs or other taxing authority if we can not reach more likely than not determination no benefit is recorded if we determine that the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained we record the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized when the tax position is settled we record interest and penalty related to income tax component of income tax expense on our consolidated statement of earnings interest and penalty were not material of content cash and cash equivalent cash equivalent include highly liquid instrument with original maturity of day or le receivables receivables net represent our unconditional right to consideration under the contract and include amount billed and currently due from customer the amount are stated at their net estimated realizable value there were no significant impairment loss related to our receivables in or contract asset contract asset include unbilled amount typically resulting from sale under contract when the percentage of completion cost to cost method of revenue recognition is utilized and revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer the amount may not exceed their estimated net realizable value contract asset are classified current based on our contract operating cycle inventory we record inventory at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value if event or change in circumstance indicate that the utility of our inventory have diminished through damage deterioration obsolescence change in price or other cause loss is recognized in the period in which it occurs we capitalize labor material subcontractor and overhead cost work in process for contract where control ha not yet passed to the customer in addition we capitalize cost incurred to fulfill contract in advance of contract award in inventory work in process if we determine that contract award is probable we determine the cost of other product and supply inventory by using the first in first out or average cost method contract liability contract liability include advance payment and billing in excess of revenue recognized contract liability are classified current based on our contract operating cycle and reported on contract by contract basis net of revenue recognized at the end of each reporting period property plant and equipment we record property plant and equipment at cost we provide for depreciation and amortization on plant and equipment generally using accelerated method during the first half of the estimated useful life of the asset and the straight line method thereafter the estimated useful life of our plant and equipment generally range from to year for building and five to year for machinery and equipment no depreciation expense is recorded on construction in progress until such asset are placed into operation depreciation expense related to plant and equipment wa million in million in and million in we review the carrying amount of long lived asset for impairment if event or change in the fact and circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable we ass impairment by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flow of the related asset grouping to it carrying amount if an asset is determined to be impaired we recognize an impairment charge in the current period for the difference between the fair value of the asset and it carrying amount capitalized software we capitalize certain cost associated with the development or purchase of internal use software the amount capitalized are included in other noncurrent asset on our consolidated balance sheet and are amortized on straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the resulting software which range from two to six year of december and capitalized software totaled million and million which were net of accumulated amortization of billion for both period no amortization expense is recorded until the software is ready for it intended use amortization expense related to capitalized software wa million in million in and million in goodwill and intangible asset the asset and liability of acquired business are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill represents cost in excess of fair value assigned to the underlying identifiable net asset of acquired business intangible asset from acquired business are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and consist of customer program trademark customer relationship technology and other intangible asset customer program include value assigned to major program of acquired business and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationship contract technology and trademark underlying the associated program and are amortized on straight line basis over period of expected cash flow used to measure fair value which range from nine to year our goodwill balance wa billion at december and billion at december we perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired such event or change in circumstance may include significant deterioration in overall economic condition change in the business climate of our industry decline in our market capitalization operating performance indicator competition reorganization of our business government budget restriction or the disposal of all or portion of reporting unit our goodwill ha been allocated to and is tested for impairment at level referred to the reporting unit which is our business segment level or level below the business segment the level of content at which we test goodwill for impairment requires to determine whether the operation below the business segment constitute self sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly review the operating result we may use either qualitative or quantitative approach when testing reporting unit goodwill for impairment for selected reporting unit where we use the qualitative approach we perform qualitative evaluation of event and circumstance impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment based on that qualitative evaluation if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying amount no further evaluation is necessary otherwise we perform quantitative impairment test we perform quantitative test for most reporting unit at least once every three year however for certain reporting unit we may perform quantitative impairment test every year for the quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of reporting unit to it carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds it fair value goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess we generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using combination of discounted cash flow dcf analysis and market based valuation methodology such comparable public company trading value and value observed in recent business acquisition determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including the amount and timing of expected future cash flow long term growth rate discount rate and relevant comparable public company earnings multiple and relevant transaction multiple the cash flow employed in the dcf analysis are based on our best estimate of future sale earnings and cash flow after considering factor such general market condition government budget

subject to trebling plus statutory penalty we believe that we have legal and factual defense to the government remaining claim although we continue to evaluate our liability and exposure we do not currently believe that it is probable that we will incur material loss if contrary to our expectation the government prevails in this matter and prof damage at or near million and is successful in

indemnify leidos with respect to the liability assumed for damage to leidos for of amount in excess of this reserve up to million and of amount in excess of million we can not reasonably estimate our exposure at this time but it is possible that settlement by or judgment against any of the defendant could implicate lockheed martin indemnification obligation described above at present in view of what we believe to be the strength of the defense our belief that leidos assumed the liability and our view of the structure of the indemnity we do not believe it probable that we will incur material loss and have not taken any reserve on april we filed declaratory judgment action against the new york metropolitan transportation authority and it capital construction company collectively the mta asking the district court for the southern district of new york to find that the mta is in material breach of our agreement based on the mta failure to provide access to site where work must be performed and the customer furnished equipment necessary to complete the contract the mta filed an answer and counterclaim alleging that we breached the contract and subsequently terminated the contract for alleged default the primary damage sought by the mta are the cost to complete the contract and potential re procurement cost while we are unable to estimate the cost of another contractor to complete the contract and the cost of re procurement we note that our contract with the mta had total value of million of which million wa paid to and that the mta is seeking damage of approximately million we dispute the mta allegation and are defending against them additionally following an investigation our surety on performance bond related to this matter who were represented by independent counsel concluded that the mta termination of the contract wa improper finally our declaratory judgment action wa later amended to include claim for monetary damage against the mta of approximately million this matter wa taken under submission by the district court in december after five week bench trial and the filing of post trial pleading by the party we continue to await decision from the district court although this matter relates to our former is business we retained the litigation when we divested is in environmental matterswe are involved in proceeding and potential proceeding relating to soil sediment surface water and groundwater contamination disposal of hazardous substance and other environmental matter at several of our current or former facility facility for which we may have contractual responsibility and at third party site where we have been designated potentially responsible party prp substantial portion of environmental cost will be included in our net sale and cost of sale in future period pursuant to government regulation at the time liability is recorded for future environmental cost we record asset for estimated future recovery considered probable through the pricing of product and service to agency of the government regardless of the contract form cost reimbursable fixed price we continually evaluate of content the recoverability of our asset for the portion of environmental cost that are probable of future recovery by assessing among other factor government regulation our government business base and contract mix our history of receiving reimbursement of such cost and effort by some government representative to limit such reimbursement we include the portion of those environmental cost expected to be allocated to our non government contract or determined not to be recoverable under government contract in our cost of sale at the time the liability is established at december and the aggregate amount of liability recorded relative to environmental matter wa million and million most of which are recorded in other noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet we have recorded asset for the portion of environmental cost that are probable of future recovery totaling million and million at december and most of which are recorded in other noncurrent asset on our consolidated balance sheet for the estimated future recovery of these cost we consider the recovery probable based on the factor previously mentioned we project cost and recovery of cost over approximately year environmental remediation activity usually span many year which make estimating liability matter of judgment because of uncertainty with respect to assessing the extent of the contamination well such factor changing remediation technology and changing regulatory environmental standard we are monitoring or investigating number of former and present operating facility for potential future remediation we perform quarterly review of the status of our environmental remediation site and the related liability and receivables additionally in our quarterly review we consider these and other factor in estimating the timing and amount of any future cost that may be required for remediation activity and we record liability when it is probable that loss ha occurred or will occur for particular site and the loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the cost to be incurred for remediation for that site we do not discount the recorded liability the amount and timing of future cash payment are not fixed or can not be reliably determined we can not reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure in all case although loss may be probable or reasonably possible in some case it is not possible at this time to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss we also pursue claim for recovery of cost incurred or for contribution to site remediation cost against other prps including the government and are conducting remediation activity under various consent decree order and agreement relating to soil groundwater sediment or surface water contamination at certain site of former or current operation under agreement related to certain site in california new york united state virgin island and washington the government and or private party reimburses an amount equal to percentage specific to each site of expenditure for certain remediation activity in their capacity prps under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla in addition to the proceeding and potential proceeding discussed above the california state water resource control board branch of the california environmental protection agency ha indicated it will work to re establish maximum level of the contaminant hexavalent chromium in drinking water after prior standard of part per billion ppb wa challenged and withdrawn and is also reevaluating it existing drinking water standard of ppb for perchlorate the environmental protection agency decided in june not to regulate perchlorate in drinking water at the federal level although this decision ha been challenged and is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium if substantially lower standard are adopted for perchlorate in california or for hexavalent chromium in california or at the federal level we expect material increase in our estimate for environmental liability and the related asset for the portion of the increased cost that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our product and service for the government the amount that would be allocable to our non government contract or that is determined not to be recoverable under government contract would be expensed which may have material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period we also are evaluating the potential impact of existing and contemplated legal requirement addressing class of compound known generally per and polyfluoroalkyl compound pfas pfas compound have been used ubiquitously such in fire fighting foam manufacturing process and stain and stick resistant product teflon stain resistant fabric because we have used product and process over the year containing some of those compound they likely exist contaminant at many of our environmental remediation site governmental authority have announced plan and in some instance have begun to regulate certain of these compound at extremely low concentration in drinking water which could lead to increased cleanup cost at many of our environmental remediation site letter of credit surety bond and third party guaranteeswe have entered into standby letter of credit and surety bond issued on our behalf by financial institution and we have directly issued guarantee to third party primarily relating to advance received from customer and the guarantee of future of content performance on certain contract letter of credit and surety bond generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform in some case we may guarantee the contractual performance of third party such joint venture partner we had total outstanding letter of credit surety bond and third party guarantee aggregating billion and billion at december and december third party guarantee do not include guarantee issued on behalf of subsidiary and other consolidated entity at december and third party guarantee totaled million and million of which approximately and related to guarantee of contractual performance of joint venture to which we currently are or previously were party these amount represent our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non performance of the joint venture joint venture partner or divested business generally we also have cross indemnity in place that may enable to recover amount that may be paid on behalf of joint venture partner in determining our exposure we evaluate the reputation performance on contractual obligation technical capability and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partner and the transferee under novation agreement all of which include guarantee required by the far at december and there were no material amount recorded in our financial statement related to third party guarantee or novation agreement note severance chargesduring we recorded severance charge totaling million million or per share after tax related to the planned
