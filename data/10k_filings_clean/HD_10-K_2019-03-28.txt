balance sheet arrangementsother than operating lease for portion of our real estate and other asset we have no off balance sheet arrangement critical accounting policiesour significant accounting policy are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statement the following discussion address our most critical accounting policy which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and result of operation and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumption or complex estimate merchandise inventorieswe value the substantial majority of our inventory under the retail inventory method using the first in first out method with the remainder of our inventory valued under cost method under the retail inventory method of contentsinventories are stated at cost which is determined by applying cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventory the retail value of our inventory is adjusted needed to reflect current market condition because these adjustment are based on current prevailing market condition the value of our inventory approximates the lower of cost or market the valuation under the retail inventory method is based on estimate such markup markdowns and inventory loss or shrink there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inventory cost and gross profit we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood for material change in the estimate or assumption we use to value our inventory under the retail inventory method we believe that the retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation which approximates cost and result in valuing our inventory at the lower of cost or market impairment of long lived assetswe evaluate our long lived asset each quarter for indicator of potential impairment indicator of impairment include current period loss combined with history of loss our decision to relocate or close store or other location before the end of it previously estimated useful life or when change in other circumstance indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation for long lived asset is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flow which is generally the individual store level the asset of store with indicator of impairment are evaluated for recoverability by comparing it undiscounted future cash flow with it carrying value our cash flow projection look several year into the future and include assumption on variable such future sale and operating margin growth rate economic condition market competition and inflation if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flow we then measure the asset fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized if the resulting fair value is le than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized we generally base our estimate of fair market value on market appraisal of owned location and estimate of the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased location impairment and lease obligation cost on closing and relocation were not material to our consolidated financial statement in fiscal self insurancewe have established liability for certain loss related to general liability including product liability worker compensation employee group medical and automobile

million and million respectively we have no stop loss limit for self insured employee group medical claim our liability represent estimate of the ultimate cost for claim incurred at the balance sheet date the estimated liability are not discounted and are established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimate the liability are reviewed by management and third party actuary on regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate while we believe these estimate are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trend including the severity or frequency of claim medical cost inflation or fluctuation in premium differ from our estimate our result of operation could be impacted actual result related to these type of claim did not vary materially from estimated amount for fiscal fiscal or fiscal revenueswe recognize revenue net of estimated return and sale tax at the time the customer take possession of merchandise or when service is performed we estimate the liability for sale return including the estimated gross profit impact based on our historical return level and believe that our estimate for sale return is reasonable reflection of future return in connection with the adoption of asu no we also recognize return asset and corresponding adjustment to cost of sale for our right to recover the good returned by the customer measured at the former carrying amount of the good le any expected recovery cost at each financial reporting date we ass our estimate of expected return refund liability and return asset we defer revenue and the related gross profit for payment received from customer for which the customer ha not yet taken possession of merchandise or we have not yet performed the service for the customer this amount is recorded deferred revenue we estimate the gross profit related to deferred revenue using historical rate which we believe to be reasonable reflection of future rate if these estimate significantly differ from actual amount our net sale and gross profit could be impacted of contentsvendor allowance vendor allowance primarily consist of volume rebate that are earned result of attaining certain purchase level and co op advertising allowance for the promotion of vendor product that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amount with additional amount earned for attaining certain purchase level these vendor allowance are accrued earned with those allowance received result of attaining certain purchase level accrued over the incentive period based on estimate of purchase we believe that our estimate of vendor allowance earned based on expected volume of purchase over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendor volume rebate and certain co op advertising allowance earned are initially recorded reduction in merchandise inventory and subsequent reduction in cost of sale when the related product is sold certain co op

incur incremental cost in transitioning to new standard and interest rate on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected by the new standard there is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of libor or of any particular replacement rate such the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital can not yet be determined but we do not

good or service in addition the standard requires disclosure of the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flow arising from contract with customer on january we adopted asu no using the modified retrospective transition method in preparation for implementation of the standard we finalized key accounting assessment and then implemented internal control and updated process to

reimbursement associated with our plcc program now recognized in net sale ii certain expense related to the sale of gift card to customer now recognized in operating expense and iii gift card breakage income now recognized in net sale we also have changed our recognition of gift card breakage income to be recognized proportionately redemption occurs rather than based on historical redemption
