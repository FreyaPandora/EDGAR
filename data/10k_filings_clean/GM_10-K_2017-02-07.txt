wide variety of raw material part supply energy freight transportation and other service from numerous supplier to manufacture our product the raw material primarily include steel aluminum resin copper lead and platinum group metal we have not experienced any significant shortage of raw material and normally do not carry substantial inventory of such raw material in excess of level reasonably required to meet our production requirement in some instance we purchase system component part and supply from single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruption the inability or unwillingness of these source to supply with part and supply could have material adverse effect on our production capacity refer to item risk factor for further discussion of these risk combined purchase of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesfrom our two largest supplier have ranged from approximately to of our total purchase in the year ended december and environmental and regulatory mattersautomotive emission control we are subject to law and regulation that require to control automotive emission including vehicle exhaust emission standard vehicle evaporative emission standard and onboard diagnostic obd system requirement advanced obd system are used to identify and diagnose problem with emission control system problem detected by the obd system and in use compliance monitoring may increase warranty cost and the likelihood of recall emission and obd requirement become more stringent each year vehicle must meet lower emission standard and new diagnostics are required throughout the world with very little harmonization of global regulation zero emission vehicle zev requirement have been adopted by some state well the canadian province of quebec and is the possibility that additional jurisdiction could adopt zev requirement in the future while we believe all our product are designed and manufactured in material compliance with substantially all vehicle emission requirement regulatory authority may conduct ongoing evaluation of the emission compliance of product from all manufacturer this includes vehicle emission testing including and nitrogen oxide emission testing and review of emission control strategy the federal government imposes stringent emission control requirement on vehicle sold in the and various state government impose additional requirement canada federal government vehicle emission requirement are generally aligned with the federal requirement each model year we must obtain certification for each test group that our vehicle will meet emission requirement from the environmental protection agency epa we can sell vehicle in the and canada and from the california air resource board carb before we can sell vehicle in california and other state that have adopted the california emission requirement carb latest emission requirement include more stringent exhaust emission and evaporative emission standard including an increase in zevs which must be offered for sale in california carb ha adopted model year and later requirement for increasing volume of zevs to achieve greenhouse gas well criterion pollutant emission reduction to help achieve the state long term greenhouse gas reduction goal the epa ha adopted similar exhaust emission and evaporative emission standard which phase in with the model year do not include zev requirement these new requirement will also increase the time and mileage period which manufacturer are responsible for vehicle emission performance the clean air act permit state that have area with air quality compliance issue to adopt the california car and light duty truck emission standard in lieu of the federal requirement thirteen state currently have these standard in effect and of these state have adopted the zev requirement emission in the european union are regulated by the european commission ec and by governmental authority in each european union member state eu member state the ec imposes emission control requirement on vehicle sold in all eu member state we must demonstrate that vehicle will meet emission requirement from an approval authority in one eu member state before we can sell vehicle in any eu member state the regulatory requirement include random testing of newly assembled vehicle and manufacturer in use surveillance program the european union requirement are equivalent in term of stringency and implementation to the framework of the united nation economic commission for europe the existing level of european union exhaust emission standard for car and light duty truck euro wa effective in for new vehicle approval and for new vehicle registration future emission standard focus particularly on further reducing emission from diesel vehicle by introducing new testing criterion based on real world driving emission rde rde test will become effective in the new requirement will require additional technology and further increase the cost of diesel engine which currently cost more than gasoline engine to manufacture to comply with rde test we believe will be necessary to implement technology which will introduce additional cost pressure on the already challenging european union market for small and mid size diesel vehicle decline in diesel penetration may make fleet compliance more challenging gasoline engine are also affected by the new requirement the potential implementation of technology into gasoline vehicle to reduce exhaust pollutant emission may further increase the cost of gasoline engine and could have adverse effect on vehicle fuel economy in addition increased scrutiny of compliance with emission standard may result in change to these standard including the implementation of rde test well stricter interpretation or redefinition of these standard and more rigorous enforcement this may lead to increased cost penalty lack of certainty with respect to product portfolio planning negative publicity or reputation impact for refer to item risk factor for further discussion of these risk of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesin the long term we expect that the ec will continue devising regulatory requirement on the emission test cycle rde low temperature testing fuel evaporation and obd china ha implemented european type china standard nationally with european obd requirement for new vehicle registration city such beijing shanghai and guangzhou each currently require china standard for new vehicle registration china implemented the china standard for light duty gasoline nationwide at the beginning of the china standard include more stringent emission requirement and increase the time and mileage period over which manufacturer are responsible for vehicle emission performance china officially released unique china emission standard with the potential to combine element of both european and standard local implementation is expected early nationwide implementation for new registration is expected in july for the base china standard and july for the more stringent china standard in south america certain country follow the test procedure standard and obd requirement and others follow the european union test procedure standard and obd requirement with different level of stringency brazil implemented national standard for light diesel vehicle in and obd installation for light diesel vehicle in standard for light gasoline vehicle were implemented in for all model automotive fuel economy in the corporate average fuel economy cafe reporting is required for three separate fleet domestically produced car imported car and light duty truck both car and light duty truck standard were established using target for various vehicle size and vehicle model sale volume in our domestic car standard is estimated to be mpg our import car standard is estimated to be mpg and our light duty truck standard is estimated to be mpg our current product plan is expected to be compliant with the federal cafe program through the model year in addition to federal cafe reporting the epa requires compliance with greenhouse gas requirement that are similar to the cafe program our current product plan is expected to be compliant with the federal greenhouse gas program through the model year carb ha agreed that compliance with the federal program is deemed to be compliant with the california program for the through model year although canada ha no parallel cafe style fuel economy regulation there are canadian greenhouse gas regulation that are aligned with the epa regulation and canadian fleet are expected to be compliant with these regulation through the model year we regularly evaluate our current and future product plan and strategy for compliance with fuel economy and greenhouse gas regulation unlike other jurisdiction the european union climate change policy framework focus on fleet average emission rather than fuel economy the european union ha implemented legislation regulating fleet average emission in europe and ha adopted an even more stringent fleet average target for requirement must be met through the introduction of reducing technology on conventional gasoline and diesel engine or through ultra low vehicle we are developing compliance plan by adopting operational target for each market entry in europe the ec will also devise regulatory requirement on the emission test cycle of china ha both an individual vehicle pas fail type approval requirement based on phase standard and fleet fuel consumption requirement based on phase standard effective in the china phase fleet fuel consumption standard is based on curb weight with full compliance to km required by china ha continued subsidy for plug in hybrid battery electric and fuel cell vehicle china proposes phase fleet fuel consumption standard effective beginning in with full compliance to required by in brazil the government ha set fuel economy requirement called inovar auto original equipment manufacturer have mandatory fleet average compliance required by october resulting in reduction from level the brazilian government provides indirect tax incentive to eligible participant company that meet certain requirement including these fuel economy target the level of potential indirect tax incentive varies based on the timing and degree to which the target are met participating company that fail to meet the required criterion are subject to clawback provision and specific fine industrial environmental control our operation are subject

our competitive position it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovation there can be no assurance that advance in technology will occur in timely or feasible way or that others will not acquire similar or superior technology sooner than we do or that we will acquire technology on an exclusive basis or at significant price advantage it generally take two year or more to design and develop new vehicle and number of factor may lengthen that time period of this product development cycle and the various element that may contribute to consumer acceptance of new vehicle design including competitor product introduction technological innovation fuel price general economic condition and change in styling preference an initial product concept or design may not result in vehicle that generates sale in sufficient quantity and at high enough price to be profitable our high proportion of fixed cost both due to our significant investment in property plant and equipment well other requirement of our collective bargaining agreement which limit our flexibility to adjust personnel cost to change in demand for our product may further exacerbate the risk associated with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicle of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesour profitability is dependent upon the success of full size pick truck and suv while we offer balanced and complete portfolio of small mid size and large car crossover sport utility vehicle suv and truck we generally recognize higher profit margin on our full size pick up truck and suv our success is dependent upon consumer preference and our ability to sell higher margin vehicle in sufficient volume any shift in consumer preference toward smaller more fuel efficient vehicle whether result of increase in the price of oil or any sustained shortage of oil including result of global political instability or other reason could weaken the demand for our higher margin full size pick up truck and suv our business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sale volume which can be volatile our business and financial result are highly sensitive to sale volume change to which can have disproportionately large effect on our profitability number of economic and market condition drive change in vehicle sale including real estate value level of unemployment availability of affordable financing fluctuation in the cost of fuel consumer confidence political unrest and global economic condition we can not predict future economic and market condition with certainty our business in china is subject to aggressive competition maintaining strong position in the chinese market is key component of our global growth strategy the automotive market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturer and numerous smaller domestic manufacturer the size of the chinese market continues to increase we anticipate that additional competitor both international and domestic will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participant will act aggressively to increase their market share increased competition may result in price reduction reduced margin and our inability to gain or hold market share the international scale and footprint of our operation expose to additional risk we manufacture sell and service product globally and rely upon global supply chain to deliver the raw material component system and part that we need to manufacture our product our global operation subject to extensive domestic and foreign regulation and expose to variety of domestic and foreign political economic and other risk including change in foreign or domestic government leadership change in foreign or domestic law or regulation impacting our overall business model or restricting our ability to manufacture purchase or sell product and political pressure to change any aspect of our business model or practice and source raw material component system and part on competitive term in manner consistent with our current practice change in domestic or foreign tax law economic tension between government and change in international trade and investment policy including restriction on the repatriation of dividend especially between the and china more detailed inspection new or higher tariff for example on product imported from mexico into the new barrier to entry or domestic preference procurement requirement or change to or withdrawal from free trade agreement change in foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate economic downturn in foreign country or geographic region where we have significant operation such china significant change in condition in the country in which we operate with the effect of competition from new market entrant and in the united kingdom with passage of referendum to discontinue membership in the european union differing local product preference and product requirement including fuel economy vehicle emission and safety impact of compliance with and other foreign country export control and economic sanction liability resulting from and foreign law and regulation including those related to the foreign corrupt practice act and certain other anti corruption law differing labor regulation and union relationship and difficulty in obtaining financing in foreign country for local operation significant amount of our operation are conducted by joint venture that we can not operate solely for our benefit many of our operation primarily in china are carried by joint venture in joint venture we share ownership and management of company with one or more party who may not have the same goal strategy priority or resource we do and may compete with outside the joint venture joint venture are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all co owner rather than for our exclusive benefit operating business joint venture often requires additional organizational formality well time consuming procedure for sharing information and making decision in joint venture we are required to foster our relationship with our co owner well promote the overall success of the joint venture and if co owner change or relationship deteriorate our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected the benefit from successful joint venture are shared among the co owner therefore we do not receive all the benefit from our successful joint venture in addition because we share ownership and management with one or more party we may have limited control over the action of joint venture particularly when we minority interest result we may be unable to prevent misconduct or other violation of applicable law by joint venture moreover joint venture may not follow the same requirement regarding compliance internal control and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent another party make decision that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issue arise within the joint venture we may have to take responsive or other action or we may be subject to penalty fine or other related action for these activity we are subject to extensive law governmental regulation and policy including those regarding fuel economy and emission control that can significantly increase our cost and affect we do business we are significantly affected by governmental of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesregulations that can increase cost related to the production of our vehicle and affect our product portfolio meeting or exceeding many of these regulation is costly and often technologically challenging especially where standard may not be harmonized across jurisdiction significant challenge with respect to mandated emission and fuel economy standard we anticipate that the number and extent of these regulation and the related cost and change to our product portfolio may increase significantly in the future these government regulatory requirement could significantly affect our plan for global product development and given the uncertainty surrounding enforcement and regulatory definition may result in substantial cost including civil or criminal penalty in addition an evolving but un harmonized regulatory framework may limit or dictate the type of vehicle we sell and where we sell which can affect revenue refer to the environmental and regulatory matter section of item business for further information on these regulatory requirement we also expect that manufacturer will continue to be subject to increased scrutiny from regulator globally for example in germany the ministry of transportation and the kraftfahrt bundesamt have requested the participation of number of automotive manufacturer including our german subsidiary in continuing discussion on emission control issue and have also requested from time to time written response from our subsidiary on the subject our german subsidiary ha participated in these discussion and ha provided the requested response to inquiry concerning nitrogen oxide emission control system of it diesel engine in addition the german and the eu parliament have instigated inquiry commission into government agency oversight of emission enforcement requesting our german subsidiary participation at the same time the german government ha initiated further industry wide inquiry about emission this scrutiny regulatory change or novel interpretation of current regulation well increased enforcement ha led to and may result in further increased testing and testing of our vehicle and analysis of their emission control system which could lead to increased cost penalty negative publicity or reputational impact and recall activity if regulator determine that emission level and required regulatory compliance be based on either wider spectrum of driving condition for future testing parameter or stricter or novel interpretation and consequent enforcement of existing requirement no assurance can be given that the ultimate outcome of any potential investigation or increased testing resulting from this scrutiny would not materially and adversely affect we expect that to comply with fuel economy and emission control requirement we will be required to sell significant volume of hybrid electric vehicle well develop and implement new technology for conventional internal combustion engine all at increased cost level there is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicle that use such technology on profitable basis or that our customer will purchase such vehicle in the quantity necessary for to comply with these regulatory program alternative compliance measure may not be sufficiently available in the marketplace to meet volume driven compliance requirement in the current uncertain regulatory framework environmental liability for which we may be responsible and that are not reasonably estimable could be substantial alleged violation of safety or emission standard could result in legal proceeding the recall of one or more of our product negotiated remedial action fine restricted product offering or combination of any of those item any of these action could have substantial adverse effect on our operation including facility idling reduced employment increased cost and loss of revenue we could be materially adversely affected by negative outcome in unusual or significant litigation governmental investigation or other legal proceeding we are subject to legal proceeding involving various issue including product liability lawsuit stockholder litigation and governmental investigation such the legal proceeding related to the ignition switch recall such legal proceeding could in the future result in the imposition of damage including punitive damage substantial fine civil lawsuit and criminal penalty interruption of business modification of business practice equitable remedy and other sanction against or our personnel well significant legal and other cost for further discussion of these matter refer to note to our consolidated financial statement if in the discretion of the attorney office for the southern district of new york the office we do not comply with the term of the deferred prosecution agreement the dpa the office may prosecute for charge alleged by the office including those relating to faulty ignition switch on september we announced that we entered into the dpa with the office regarding it investigation of the event leading up to certain recall announced in february and march of relating to faulty ignition switch under the dpa we consented to among other thing the filing of two count information the information in the district court for the southern district of new york charging gm with scheme to conceal material fact from government regulator and wire fraud we pled not guilty to the charge alleged in the information the dpa further provides that in the event the office determines during the period of deferral of prosecution or any extension thereof that we have violated any provision of the dpa including violating any federal law or our obligation to cooperate with and assist the independent monitor the office may in it discretion either prosecute on the charge alleged in the information or impose an extension of the period of deferral of prosecution of up to one additional year under such circumstance the office would be permitted to rely of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesupon the admission we made in the dpa and would benefit from our waiver of certain procedural and evidentiary defense such criminal prosecution could subject to penalty the cost and effect on our reputation of product safety recall could materially adversely affect our business government safety standard require manufacturer to remedy certain product safety defect through recall campaign under these standard we could be subject to civil or criminal penalty or may incur various cost including significant cost for free repair at present the cost we incur in connection with these recall typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part we currently source variety of system component raw material and part including but not limited to air bag inflator from third party from time to time these item may have performance or quality issue that could harm our reputation and cause to incur significant cost for example we are currently conducting recall for certain takata corporation takata air bag inflator used in some of our prior model year vehicle we are continuing to ass the situation further recall if any that may be required to remediate takata air bag inflator in our vehicle could have material impact on our business in addition product recall can harm our reputation and cause to lose customer particularly if those recall cause consumer to question the safety or reliability of our product conversely not issuing recall or not issuing recall on timely basis can harm our reputation potentially expose to significant monetary penalty and cause to lose customer for the same reason expressed above any disruption in our supplier operation could disrupt our production schedule our automotive operation are dependent upon the continued ability of our supplier to deliver the system component raw material and part that we need to manufacture our product our use of in time manufacturing process allows to maintain minimal inventory quantity of system component raw material and part result our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our supplier delivering sufficient quantity of system component raw material and part on time to meet our production schedule in some instance we purchase system component raw material and part from single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruption financial difficulty or solvency problem with our supplier including takata which may be exacerbated by the cost of remediating quality issue with these item could lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruption for which could in turn disrupt our operation including production of certain of our higher margin vehicle where we experience supply disruption we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of system component raw material or part even for relatively short period of time could cause to alter production schedule or suspend production entirely we are dependent on our manufacturing facility around the world we assemble vehicle at various facility around the world these facility are typically designed to produce particular model for particular geographic market no single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicle in some case certain facility produce product that disproportionately contribute greater degree to our profitability than others should these or other facility become unavailable either temporarily or permanently for any number of reason including labor disruption the inability to manufacture vehicle there may result in harm to our reputation increased cost lower revenue and the loss of customer we may not be able to easily shift production of vehicle at an inoperable facility to other facility or to make up for lost production any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirement need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirement and require specialized equipment even though we carry business interruption insurance policy we may suffer loss result of business interruption that exceed the coverage available or any loss which may be excluded under our insurance policy we operate in highly competitive industry that ha excess manufacturing capacity and attempt by our competitor to sell more vehicle could have significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating result the global automotive industry is highly competitive and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry exceeds demand many manufacturer have relatively high fixed labor cost well significant limitation on their ability to close facility and reduce fixed cost our competitor may respond to these relatively high fixed cost by providing subsidized financing or leasing program offering marketing incentive or reducing vehicle price our competitor may also seek to benefit from economy of scale by consolidating or entering into other strategic agreement such alliance intended to enhance their competitiveness domestic manufacturer in lower cost country such china and india have become competitor in key emerging market and announced their intention to export their product to established market low cost alternative to established entry level automobile in addition foreign government may decide to implement tax and other policy that favor their domestic manufacturer at the expense of international manufacturer including gm and it joint venture partner these action have had and are expected to continue to have significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating result and present significant risk to our ability to enhance our revenue per vehicle of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiarieswe may continue to restructure or divest our operation in various country but we may not succeed in we face difficult market and operating condition in certain part of the world that may require to restructure or rationalize these operation which may result in impairment in many country across our region we have experienced challenge in our operation and continue to strategically ass the manner in which we operate in certain country we continue to ass our performance throughout our region additional restructuring and rationalization action may be required and may be material our future competitiveness and ability to achieve long term profitability depends on our ability to control our cost which requires to successfully implement operating effectiveness initiative throughout our automotive operation we are continuing to implement number of operating effectiveness initiative to improve productivity and reduce cost our future competitiveness depends upon our continued success in implementing these initiative throughout our automotive operation while some of the element of cost reduction are within our control others such interest rate or return on investment which influence our expense for pension depend more on external factor and there can be no assurance that such external factor will not materially adversely affect our ability to reduce our cost reducing cost may prove difficult due to our focus on increasing advertising and our belief that engineering and other expense necessary to improve the performance safety and customer satisfaction of our vehicle and to continue to innovate our technology and product offering to meet changing customer need and market development are likely to increase security breach and other disruption to our vehicle information technology network and system could interfere with the safety of our customer or our operation and could compromise the confidentiality of private customer data or our proprietary information we rely upon information technology network and system including in vehicle system and mobile device some of which are managed by third party to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support variety of vehicle or business process and activity additionally we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information proprietary business information of our dealer and

technology network and system and in vehicle system may be vulnerable to damage disruption or shutdown due to attack by hacker or breach due to error or malfeasance by employee contractor and others who have access to our network and system or computer virus the occurrence of any of these event could compromise our network and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen these occurrence could also impact vehicle safety we have been the target of these type of attack in the past and future attack are likely to occur if successful these type of attack on our network or system including in vehicle system and mobile device or service failure could result in among other thing the loss of proprietary data interruption or delay in our business operation and damage to our reputation in addition any such access disruption technological failure disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claim or proceeding liability or regulatory penalty under law protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operation and reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technology we rely on gm financial to provide financial service to our dealer and customer in majority of the market in which we sell vehicle gm financial face number of business economic and financial risk that could impair it access to capital and negatively affect it business and operation and it ability to provide leasing and financing to retail consumer and commercial lending to our dealer to support additional sale of our vehicle we rely on gm financial in north america europe south america and china to support leasing and sale of our vehicle to consumer requiring vehicle financing and also to provide commercial lending to our dealer any reduction in gm financial ability to provide such financial service would negatively affect our effort to support additional sale of our vehicle and expand our market penetration among consumer and dealer an entity operating in the financial service sector gm financial is required to comply with wide variety of law and regulation that may be costly to adhere to and may affect our consolidated operating result compliance with these law and regulation requires that gm financial maintain form process procedure control and the infrastructure to support these

autonomous vehicle grow our brand particularly the cadillac brand in the and china and the chevrolet brand globally continue our growth in china continue the growth of gm financial into our full captive automotive financing company and deliver core operating efficiency in addition to our ebit adjusted margin improvement goal our overall financial target include expected total annual operational and functional cost saving of billion through compared to cost of which approximately billion ha been realized of december and which we expect will more than offset our incremental investment in brand building engineering and technology we launch new product in and beyond and execution of our capital allocation program described in the liquidity and capital resource section of this md for the year ending december we expect to continue to generate strong consolidated financial result including improved total net sale and revenue ebit adjusted and ebit adjusted margin that equal or exceed the corresponding amount in roic adjusted of greater than automotive operating cash flow of approximately billion adjusted automotive free cash flow of approximately billion and eps diluted and eps diluted adjusted of between and we do not consider the potential future impact of adjustment on our expected financial result we expect these financial result in part to be driven by

to achieve acceptable return on our invested capital we continue to ass our performance additional restructuring and rationalization action may be required or determination may be made that the carrying amount of our long lived asset may not be recoverable in certain of these country such determination may give rise to future asset impairment or other charge which may have material impact on our result of operation gmna in the year ended december industry sale to retail and fleet customer were million unit representing increase compared to the corresponding period in due to strong consumer demand driven by credit availability low interest rate and low fuel price in the year ended december our vehicle sale in the our largest market in north america totaled million unit for market share of representing decrease of percentage point compared to the corresponding period in the decrease in our market share wa driven primarily by lower fleet market share due to planned reduction in rental delivery partially offset by higher retail market share retail sale generally more profitable than fleet sale generated an increase of percentage point in market share primarily driven by chevrolet we achieved ebit adjusted margin of during on continued strength of industry light vehicle sale new product launch and material and other cost saving which partially offset launch related cost based on our current cost structure we continue to estimate gmna breakeven point at the industry level to be in the range of million unit we expect to sustain an ebit adjusted margin of in on continued strength of industry light vehicle sale key product launch and continued focus on overall cost saving gme result of moderate economic growth across europe excluding russia automotive industry sale to retail and fleet customer continued improving in the year ended december with industry sale to retail and fleet customer of million unit representing increase compared to the corresponding period in our european operation are benefiting from this trend and vehicle sale continue to show sign of improvement underscored by further improvement in our opel and vauxhall retail vehicle sale of million unit for market share of in the year ended december consistent with the corresponding period in we continue to implement various strategic action to strengthen our operation and increase our competitiveness despite the improvement we experienced through most of we were unable to overcome the impact of the referendum vote to leave the european union brexit resulting in billion unfavorable impact due primarily to adverse movement in the british pound against the dollar we anticipate the impact of brexit to continue through we also anticipate headwind associated with industry pricing pressure and increased cost associated with depreciation amortization marketing and cost associated with our new product launch we intend to mitigate these headwind with the full benefit of our recently launched astra and mokka along with the launch of the insignia ampera and two new crossover that we believe will substantially increase our competitiveness in this growing

dirs for previously unrecalled front airbag inflator that contain an ammonium nitrate based propellant without moisture absorbing desiccant on multi year risk based schedule through impacting ten of

subsidiariestime temperature cycling and environmental moisture on may takata issued it first dir in connection with the amended consent order and on january takata issued it second set of dirs although we do not believe there is safety defect at this time in any gm vehicle within the scope of the takata dir in cooperation with nhtsa we filed preliminary dirs on may updated of june covering million of certain of our vehicle which are full size pick up truck and suv on november we filed petition for inconsequentiality and request for deferral of determination regarding certain vehicle equipped with takata inflator on november nhtsa granted gm deferral request in connection with this petition the deferral provides gm until august to present evidence and analysis that our vehicle do not pose an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety we believe that this timeline will permit to complete our testing of the relevant non desiccated takata inflator in vehicle and to prove to nhtsa that the inflator in these vehicle do not present an unreasonable risk to safety and that no repair will ultimately be required takata filed second set of equipment dirs on january and we filed second set of preliminary dirs for certain vehicle on january these january dirs are consistent with gm may dirs on the same day we also filed second petition for inconsequentiality and deferral of decision with respect to the vehicle subject to our january dirs on january nhtsa consolidated our first and second petition for inconsequentiality and will rule on both at the same time we believe these vehicle are currently performing designed and ongoing testing continues to support the belief that the vehicle unique design and integration mitigates against inflator degradation for example the airbag inflator used in the vehicle are variant engineered specifically for our vehicle and include feature such greater venting unique propellant wafer configuration and machined steel end cap the inflator are packaged in the instrument panel in such way to minimize exposure to moisture from the climate control system also these vehicle have feature that minimize the maximum temperature to which the inflator will be exposed such larger interior volume and standard solar absorbing windshield and side glass we believe that the result of further testing and analysis will demonstrate that the vehicle do not present an unreasonable risk to safety and that no repair will ultimately be required accordingly no warranty provision ha been made for any repair associated with our vehicle subject to the preliminary dirs and amended consent order however in the event we are ultimately obligated to repair the inflator in these vehicle we estimate reasonably possible cost of up to million for the million vehicle subject to either the preliminary dirs or future takata dirs under the amended consent order through january we were aware of one putative class action pending against gm in federal court in the one putative class action in mexico and seven putative class action pending in various provincial court in canada arising out of allegation that airbag inflator manufactured by

unrecognized tax benefit of billion due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflow potentially associated with these amount critical accounting estimate accounting estimate are an integral part of the consolidated financial statement these estimate require the use of judgment and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability the disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense in the period presented we believe the accounting estimate employed are appropriate and the resulting balance are reasonable however due to the inherent uncertainty in developing estimate actual result could differ from the original estimate requiring adjustment to these balance in future period refer to note to our consolidated financial statement for our significant accounting policy related to our critical accounting estimate pension and opeb plan our defined benefit pension plan are accounted for on an actuarial basis which requires the selection of various assumption including an expected long term rate of return on plan asset discount rate mortality rate of participant and expectation of mortality improvement the expected long term rate of return on plan asset that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic study which include review of asset allocation strategy anticipated future long term performance of individual asset class risk using standard deviation and correlation of return among the asset class that comprise the plan asset mix while the study give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical return the assumption are primarily long term prospective rate of return in december an investment policy study wa completed for the pension plan the study resulted in new target asset allocation being approved for the pension plan with resulting change to the expected long term rate of return on asset the weighted average long term rate of return on asset decreased from at december to at december the expected long term rate of return on plan asset used in determining pension expense for non plan is determined in similar manner to the plan another key assumption in determining net pension and opeb expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligation we estimate the assumed discount rate for plan using cash flow matching approach which us projected cash flow matched to spot rate along high quality corporate yield curve to determine the weighted average discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flow effective we applied the individual annual yield curve rate instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost this refinement more specifically link the cash flow related to service cost and interest cost to bond maturing in their year of payment the refinement reduced the service cost and interest cost in by billion there wa no effect on the determination of the plan obligation which continues to be calculated using the assumed discount rate we have reviewed and incorporated the mortality improvement table published by the society of actuary in the three month ended december that lowered life expectancy and thereby indicated the amount of estimated aggregate benefit payment to our pension plan participant wa decreasing this change in assumption decreased the december pension and opeb plan benefit obligation by billion significant difference in actual experience or significant change in assumption may materially affect the pension obligation the effect of actual result differing from assumption and the changing of assumption are included in unamortized net actuarial gain and loss that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future period the unamortized pre tax actuarial loss on our pension plan wa billion and billion at december and the year over year change is primarily due of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesto the decrease in discount rate partially offset by assumption change primarily the mortality improvement scale at december billion of the unamortized pre tax actuarial loss is outside the corridor of the projected benefit obligation pbo and subject to amortization the weighted average amortization period is approximately twelve year resulting in amortization expense of billion in the underfunded status of the pension plan decreased by billion in the year ended december to billion due primarily to favorable effect of actual return on plan asset of billion contribution of billion and favorable assumption change primarily the mortality improvement scale of billion partially offset by interest and service cost of billion and an unfavorable effect due to decrease in discount rate of billion the following table illustrates the sensitivity to change in certain assumption for the pension plan holding all other assumption

rate applied for the calculation of the service cost and interest cost effective in refer to note to our consolidated financial statement for additional information on pension contribution investment strategy assumption the change in benefit obligation and related plan asset pension funding requirement and future net benefit payment refer to note to our consolidated financial statement for discussion of the input used to determine fair value for each significant asset class or category valuation of deferred tax asset the ability to realize deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward period provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction the assessment regarding whether valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible source of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factor our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax asset represents our best estimate of future event change in our current estimate due to unanticipated market condition governmental legislative action or event could have material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax asset at december total deferred tax asset were billion and valuation allowance against those deferred tax asset were billion refer to note to our consolidated financial statement for additional information on the composition of these valuation allowance if law is enacted that reduces the statutory tax rate we would record significant one time reduction to the net deferred tax asset and related increase to income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date of the tax rate change valuation of gm financial equipment on operating lease asset and residual gm financial ha investment in leased vehicle recorded operating lease which relate to vehicle lease to retail customer with lease term ranging from two to five year at the beginning of the lease contract determination is made of the estimated realizable value residual value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term which is the critical assumption underlying the estimated carrying value of leased asset the estimated realizable value is based on the lower of the contracted residual value or the current market estimate of residual value based on independent lease guide since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract gm financial is exposed to risk of loss to the extent the value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term is below the residual value estimated at contract inception over the life of the lease gm financial evaluates the adequacy of the estimate of the residual value and may make adjustment to the extent the expected value of the vehicle at lease termination change adjustment could result in change in the depreciation rate of the leased asset or if an impairment exists an impairment charge the following table summarizes vehicle included in gm financial equipment on operating lease net vehicle in thousand of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiary december december december gm financial estimated residual value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term wa billion the following table illustrates the effect of change in the estimated residual value at december which will increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of gm financial operating lease holding all other assumption constant impact to depreciation expensecars warranty and recall campaign the estimate related to product warranty are established using historical information on the nature frequency and average cost of claim of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumption about future activity and event when little or no claim experience exists for model year or vehicle line the estimate is based on comparable model in gmna we primarily accrue the cost for recall campaign at the time of vehicle sale in the other region there is not sufficient historical data to support the application of an actuarial based estimation technique and the estimated cost are accrued at the time when they are probable and reasonably estimable which typically occurs once it is determined specific recall campaign is needed and announced the estimate related to recall campaign accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying frequency time severity approach that considers the number of recall event the number of vehicle per recall event the assumed number of vehicle that will be brought in by customer for repair take rate and the cost per vehicle for each recall event these estimate consider the nature frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaign cost associated with recall campaign not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repair and the estimated vehicle to be repaired depending on part availability and time to complete repair we may from time to time offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customer these estimate are re evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information revision are made when necessary based on change in these factor the estimated amount accrued for recall campaign at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall event the number of vehicle per recall event the take rate and the cost per vehicle for each recall event the estimated cost of recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaign would increase the estimated cost by approximately billion actual experience could differ from the amount estimated requiring adjustment to these liability in future period due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factor contributing to developing estimate change in our assumption could materially affect our result of operation sale incentive the estimated effect of sale incentive offered to dealer and end customer is recorded reduction of automotive net sale and revenue at the later of the time of sale or announcement of an incentive program to dealer there may be numerous type of incentive available at any particular time including choice of incentive for specific model incentive program are generally brand specific model specific or sale region specific and are for specified time period which may be extended significant factor used in estimating the cost of incentive include the volume of vehicle that will be affected by the incentive program offered by product the product mix the rate of customer acceptance of any incentive program and the likelihood that an incentive program will be extended all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumption concerning customer behavior and future market condition when an incentive program is announced the number of vehicle in dealer of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesinventory eligible for the incentive program is determined and reduction of automotive net sale and revenue is recorded in the period in which the program is announced if the actual number of affected vehicle differs from this estimate or if different mix of incentive is actually paid the reduction in automotive net sale and revenue due to incentive could be affected there are multitude of input affecting the calculation of the estimate for sale incentive and an increase or decrease in any of these variable could have significant effect on recorded sale incentive forward looking

of financial instrument with exposure to market risk the model used assume instantaneous parallel shift in exchange rate and interest rate yield curve for option and other instrument with nonlinear return model appropriate to these type of instrument are utilized to determine the effect of market shift there are certain shortcoming inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented due primarily to the assumption that interest rate change in parallel fashion and that spot exchange rate change instantaneously in addition the analysis are unable to reflect the complex market reaction that normally would arise from the market shift modeled and do not contemplate the effect of correlation between foreign currency pair or offsetting long short position in currency pair which may significantly

under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organization act rico and those brought by any plaintiff whose vehicle wa not allegedly defective when sold the district court also rejected plaintiff broadest theory of damage that plaintiff could seek recovery for alleged reduction in the value of their vehicle due to damage to gm reputation and brand result of the ignition switch matter the district court also held that plaintiff did not have common basis for their claim across all defect and model to proceed single class and that the remaining claim may have to proceed individually or in subclass of vehicle affected by common defect further the district court held that the named plaintiff may assert claim only on behalf of owner of the same vehicle model that they purchased or leased or model with sufficiently similar defect and that it will not specify the specific permissible class claim until the class certification stage finally the district court granted gm motion to dismiss with respect to certain state law claim but denied it to other state law claim the court held that the viability of state law claim will depend on each state specific law and plaintiff specific factual allegation while the ruling addressed post bankruptcy claim we believe the district court legal holding should apply to limit plaintiff pre bankruptcy claim similarly on september

including pre closing personal injury claim and economic loss claim the second circuit also vacated that portion of the bankruptcy court judgment enforcing the sale order against plaintiff with pre sale claim based on defect other than the ignition switch and remanded that issue to the bankruptcy court for further proceeding the second circuit denied our request for an en banc review of the

we are required to pay the compensation and expense of the monitor and of the person hired under his or her authority the monitor commenced his term in november the total amount accrued at december reflects amount for combination of settled but unpaid matter and for the remaining unsettled investigation claim and or lawsuit relating to the ignition switch recall and other related recall represents combination of our best single point estimate where determinable and where no such single point estimate is determinable our estimate of the low end of the range of probable loss with regard to such matter if that is determinable we believe it is probable that we will incur additional liability beyond ha already been accrued with regard to at least portion of the remaining matter whether through settlement or judgment however we are currently unable to estimate an overall amount or range of loss because these matter involve significant uncertainty including the legal theory or the nature of the investigation claim and or lawsuit the complexity of the fact the lack of documentation available to with respect to particular case or group of case the result of any investigation or litigation and the timing of resolution of the investigation or litigation including any appeal further proceeding following the supreme court decision to whether it will grant review of the second

preliminary dirs for certain vehicle on january these january dirs are consistent with gm may dirs on the same day we also filed second petition for inconsequentiality and deferral of decision with respect to the vehicle subject to our january dirs on january nhtsa consolidated our first and second petition for inconsequentiality and will rule on both at the same time we believe these vehicle are currently performing designed and ongoing testing continues to support the belief that the vehicle unique design and integration mitigates against inflator degradation we believe that the result of further testing and analysis will demonstrate that the vehicle do not present an unreasonable risk to safety and that no repair will ultimately be required accordingly no warranty provision ha been made for any repair associated with our vehicle subject to the preliminary dirs and amended consent order however in the event we are ultimately obligated to repair the inflator in these vehicle we estimate reasonably possible cost of up to million for the million vehicle subject to either the preliminary dirs or future takata dirs under the amended consent order through january we were aware of one putative class action pending against gm in federal court in the one putative class action in mexico and seven putative class action pending in various provincial court in canada arising out of

gm at this early stage of these proceeding we are unable to provide an evaluation of the likelihood that loss will be incurred or an estimate of the amount or range of possible loss product liability with respect to product liability claim other than claim relating to the ignition switch recall discussed above involving our and general motor corporation product we believe that any judgment against

known product liability claim plus an estimate of the expected cost for product liability claim that have already been incurred and are expected to be filed in the future for which we are self insured in light of vehicle recall in recent year it is reasonably possible that our accrual for product liability claim may increase in future period in material amount although we can not estimate reasonable range of incremental loss based on currently available information guarantee we enter into indemnification agreement for liability claim involving product manufactured primarily by certain joint venture we also provide vehicle repurchase guarantee and payment guarantee on commercial loan outstanding with third party such dealer these guarantee terminate in year ranging from to or upon

obligation the total exposure would be reduced to the extent vehicle are able to be resold to another dealer we periodically enter into agreement that incorporate indemnification provision in the
