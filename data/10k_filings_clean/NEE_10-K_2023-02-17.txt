fpl may charge are approved by regulatory body by the fpsc in the case of retail customer and by the ferc in the case of wholesale customer in general under and florida law regulated rate are intended to cover the cost of providing service including reasonable rate of return on invested capital since the regulatory body have authority to determine the relevant cost of providing service and the appropriate rate of return on capital employed there can be no guarantee that fpl will be able to earn any particular rate of return or recover all of it cost through regulated rate see fpl regulation below fpl seek to maintain attractive rate for it customer since rate are largely cost based maintaining low rate requires strategy focused on developing and maintaining low cost position including the implementation of idea generated from cost saving initiative franchise agreement and competitionfpl service to it electric retail customer is provided primarily under franchise agreement negotiated with municipality or county during the term of franchise agreement which is typically year the municipality or county agrees not to form it own utility and fpl ha the right to offer electric service to resident at december fpl held franchise agreement with various municipality and county in florida with varying expiration date through these franchise agreement cover the vast

itcs cash grant tax abatement and rps program pursuant to the federal modified accelerated cost recovery system wind and solar generation facility are depreciated for tax purpose over five year period even though the useful life of such facility is generally much longer than five year owner of wind and solar facility are eligible to claim an income tax credit the ptc or an itc in lieu of the ptc upon initially achieving commercial operation this incentive wa created under the energy policy act of and ha been extended several time for wind the previous ptc for solar expired in the ira expanded the ptc to include solar generation facility and extended the ptc and the itc to wind and solar generation facility that start construction before the later of or the end of the calendar year following the year in which greenhouse gas emission from electric generation are reduced by from level accordingly owner of wind and solar generation facility placed in service in or later are eligible to claim ptc or an itc in lieu of the ptc upon initially achieving commercial operation the ptc is determined based on the amount of electricity produced by the facility during the first ten year of commercial operation alternatively an itc equal to of the cost of the facility may be claimed in lieu of the ptc facility must also meet certain labor requirement to qualify for the ptc or itc rate or construction must have started on the facility before january in addition the ptc is increased by and the itc rate is increased by percentage point for facility that satisfy certain tax credit enhancement requirement retrofitted wind and solar generation facility may qualify for ptc or an itc if the cost basis of the new investment is at least of the retrofitted facility total fair value in addition the ira expanded the itc to include storage project placed in service after previously such project qualified only if they were connected to and charged by renewable generation facility that claimed the itc well renewable natural gas facility that are placed in service after and begin construction before the ira created ptc of kilogram of green low emission hydrogen produced at facility after and during the first ten year of commercial operation or itc in lieu of the ptc provided that construction of the facility begin before these credit are also subject to certain other requirement in addition storage project and hydrogen facility claiming an itc are eligible for percentage point increase in the itc rate if the facility satisfy certain tax credit enhancement requirement wind or

and carbon offset well marketing and trading service to customer of contentsmarkets and competitionelectricity market in the and canada are regional and diverse in character all are extensively regulated and competition in these market is shaped and constrained by regulation the nature of the product offered varies based on the specific of regulation in each region generally in addition to the natural constraint on pricing freedom presented by competition neer may also face specific constraint in the form of price cap or maximum allowed price for certain product neer ability to sell the output of it generation facility may also be constrained by available transmission capacity which can vary from time to time and can have significant impact on pricing the degree and nature of competition is different in wholesale market than in retail market majority of neer revenue are derived from sale of energy capacity credit and ancillary product under long term ppas to customer located in wholesale electricity market wholesale power generation is capital intensive commodity driven business with numerous industry participant neer primarily competes on the basis of price but belief the green attribute of neer generation asset it track record of completing project on schedule it creditworthiness and it ability to offer and manage reliable customized risk solution to wholesale customer are competitive advantage wholesale power generation is regional business that is highly fragmented relative to many other commodity industry and diverse in term of industry structure such there is wide variation in term of the capability resource nature and identity of the company neer competes with depending on the market in wholesale market customer need are met through variety of mean including long term bilateral contract standardized bilateral product such full requirement service and customized supply and risk management service in general and canadian electricity market encompass three class of service energy and related energy credit capacity and ancillary service energy service relate to the physical delivery of power capacity service relate to the availability of mw capacity of power generation asset and ancillary service are other service that relate to power generation asset such load regulation and spinning and non spinning reserve the exact nature of these class of service is defined in part by regional tariff not all region have capacity service class and the specific definition of ancillary service vary from region to region rtos and isos exist throughout much of north america to coordinate generation and transmission across wide geographic area and to run market neer operates in all rto and iso jurisdiction at december neer also had generation facility with total net generating capacity of approximately mw that fall within reliability region that are not under the jurisdiction of an established rto or iso including mw within the western electricity coordinating council and mw within the serc reliability corporation although each rto and iso may have differing objective and structure some benefit of these entity include regional planning managing transmission congestion developing larger wholesale market for energy and capacity maintaining reliability and facilitating competition among wholesale electricity provider neer ha operation that fall within the following rtos and isos of contentsneer competes in different region to differing degree but in general it seek to enter into long term bilateral contract for the full output of it generation facility at december approximately of neer net generating capacity wa committed under long term contract where long term contract are not in effect neer sell the output of it facility into daily spot market in such case neer will frequently enter into shorter term bilateral contract typically of le than three year duration to hedge the price risk associated with selling into daily spot market such bilateral contract which may be hedge either for physical delivery or for financial pricing offset serve to protect portion of the revenue that neer expects to derive from the associated generation facility contract that serve the economic purpose of hedging some portion of the expected revenue of generation facility but are not recorded hedge

produce recs and other environmental attribute which are typically sold along with the energy from the plant under long term contract or may be sold separately from wind and solar generation not sold under long term contract the purchasing party is solely entitled to the reporting right and ownership of the environmental attribute the majority of neer revenue is derived from the output of it generation facility neer is also an active competitor in several region in the wholesale full requirement business and in providing structured and customized power and fuel product and service to variety of customer in the full requirement service typically the supplier agrees to meet the customer need for full range of product for every hour of the day at fixed price for predetermined period of time thereby assuming the risk of fluctuation in the customer volume requirement expanded competition in frequently changing regulatory environment present both opportunity and risk for neer opportunity exist for the selective acquisition of generation asset and for the construction and operation of efficient facility that can sell power in competitive market neer seek to reduce it market

are also subject to foreign environmental law regulation and other standard and such are subject to similar risk there are significant capital operating and other cost associated with compliance with these environmental statute rule and regulation and those cost could be even more significant in the future result of new requirement stricter or more expansive application of existing environmental law and regulation and the addition of specie to the endangered specie list violation of current or future law rule regulation or other standard could expose nee and fpl to regulatory and legal proceeding dispute with and legal challenge by governmental entity and third party and potentially significant civil fine criminal penalty and other sanction such restriction on nextera energy

number of nextera energy resource wind facility if nextera energy resource subsidiary violates the term of the probation or fails to obtain eagle take permit under the bgepa for certain of it wind facility and additional eagle perish in collision with facility turbine nextera energy resource or it subsidiary may face criminal prosecution under these law nee and fpl business could be negatively affected by federal or state law or regulation mandating new or additional limit on the production of greenhouse gas emission federal or state law or regulation may be adopted that would impose new or additional limit on the emission of greenhouse gas including but not limited to carbon dioxide and methane from electric generation unit using fuel such natural gas the potential effect of greenhouse gas emission limit on nee and fpl electric generation unit are subject to significant uncertainty based on among other thing the timing of the implementation of any new requirement the required level of emission reduction the nature of any market based or tax based mechanism adopted to facilitate reduction the relative availability of greenhouse gas emission reduction offset the development of cost effective commercial scale carbon capture and storage technology and supporting regulation and liability mitigation measure and the range of available compliance alternative while nee and fpl electric generation portfolio emits greenhouse gas at lower rate of emission than most of the electric generation sector the result of operation of nee and fpl could be materially adversely affected to the extent that new federal or state law or regulation impose any new greenhouse gas emission limit any future limit on greenhouse gas emission could create substantial additional cost in the form of tax or emission allowance make some of nee and fpl electric generation unit uneconomical to operate in the long term require significant capital investment in carbon capture and storage technology fuel switching or the replacement of high emitting generation facility with lower emitting generation facility or affect the availability or cost of fuel such natural gas there can be no assurance that nee or fpl would be able to completely recover any such cost or investment which could have material adverse effect on their business financial condition result of operation and prospect extensive federal regulation of the operation and business of nee and fpl expose nee and fpl to significant and increasing compliance cost and may also expose them to substantial monetary penalty and other sanction for compliance failure nee and fpl operation and business are subject to extensive federal regulation which generally imposes significant and increasing compliance cost on their operation and business additionally any actual or alleged compliance failure could result in significant cost and other potentially adverse effect of regulatory investigation proceeding settlement decision and claim including among other item potentially significant monetary penalty an example under the energy policy act of nee and fpl owner and operator of bulk power transmission system and or electric generation facility are subject to mandatory reliability standard compliance with these mandatory reliability standard may subject nee and fpl to higher operating cost and may result in increased capital expenditure if fpl or nee is found not to be in compliance with these standard they may incur substantial monetary penalty and other sanction both the cost of regulatory compliance and the cost that may be imposed result of any actual or alleged compliance failure could have material adverse effect on nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect change in tax law guidance or policy including but not limited to change in corporate income tax rate well judgment and estimate used in the determination of tax related asset and liability amount could materially adversely affect nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect of contentsnee and fpl provision for income tax and reporting of tax related asset and liability require significant judgment and the use of estimate amount of tax related asset and liability involve judgment and estimate of the timing and probability of recognition of income deduction

loss and tax credit carryforwards actual income tax could vary significantly from estimated amount due to the future impact of among other thing change in tax law guidance or policy including change in corporate income tax rate the financial condition and result of operation of nee and fpl and the resolution of audit issue raised by taxing authority these factor including the ultimate resolution of income tax matter may result in material adjustment to tax related asset and liability which could materially adversely affect nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect may be materially adversely affected due to adverse result of litigation nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect may be materially affected by adverse result of litigation unfavorable resolution of legal or administrative proceeding in which nee or fpl is involved or other future legal or administrative proceeding may have material adverse effect on the business financial condition result of operation and prospect of nee and fpl allegation of violation of law by fpl or nee have the potential to result in fine penalty or other sanction or effect well cause reputational damage for fpl and nee and could hamper fpl and nee effectiveness in interacting with governmental

ultimate determination of legal violation for example medium article have been published that allege among other thing florida state and federal campaign finance law violation by fpl these article are referenced in complaint subsequently filed with the federal election commission fec that alleges certain violation of the federal election campaign act fpl and nee can not guarantee that the fec complaint process will not ultimately result in finding that fpl or nee violated federal campaign finance or other law that applicable federal or state governmental authority may not investigate or take enforcement action with respect to the allegation or assert that legal violation by fpl or nee have occurred or that violation may not ultimately be found by court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to have occurred in addition notwithstanding the completion or pendency of any internal review or investigation by fpl or nee of any allegation of legal violation including of the allegation regarding campaign finance law set forth in the medium article or fec complaint fpl and nee can not provide assurance that any of the foregoing will not result in the imposition of material fine penalty or otherwise result in other sanction or effect on fpl or nee or will not have material adverse impact on the reputation of nee or fpl or on the effectiveness of their interaction with governmental regulator or other authority development and operational risksnee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect could suffer if nee and fpl do not proceed with project under development or are unable to complete the construction of or capital improvement to electric generation transmission and distribution facility gas infrastructure facility or other facility on schedule or within budget nee and fpl ability to proceed with project under development and to complete construction of and capital improvement project for their electric generation transmission and distribution facility gas infrastructure facility and other facility on schedule and within budget have been in limited instance and in the future may be adversely affected by escalating cost for material and labor and regulatory compliance inability to obtain or renew necessary license right of way permit or other approval on acceptable term or on schedule dispute involving contractor labor organization land owner governmental entity environmental group native american and aboriginal group lessor joint venture partner and other third party negative publicity transmission interconnection issue geopolitical factor supply chain disruption inflation rising interest rate and other factor for example the ability of nee and fpl to develop solar generation facility is dependent on the international supply chain for solar panel and associated equipment and governmental or regulatory action have caused minor and could in the future cause material disruption in the ability of nee and fpl to acquire solar panel on time and at acceptable cost if any development project or construction or capital improvement project is not completed is delayed or is subject to cost overrun certain associated cost may not be approved for recovery or otherwise be recoverable through regulatory mechanism that may be available and nee and fpl could become obligated to make delay or termination payment or become obligated for other damage under contract could experience the loss of tax credit or tax incentive or delayed or diminished return and could be required to write off all or portion of their investment in the project any of these event could have material adverse effect on nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect of contentsnee and fpl face risk related to project siting financing construction permitting governmental approval and the negotiation of project development agreement that may impede their development and operating activity nee and fpl own develop construct manage and operate electric generation and transmission facility and natural gas transmission facility key component of nee and fpl growth is their ability to construct and operate generation and transmission facility to meet customer need part of these operation nee and fpl must periodically apply for license and permit from various local state federal and other regulatory authority and abide by their respective condition should nee or fpl be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary license or permit on acceptable term or resolving third party challenge to such license or permit should there be delay in obtaining or renewing necessary license or permit or should regulatory authority initiate any associated investigation or enforcement action or impose related penalty or disallowances on nee or fpl nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect could be materially adversely affected any failure to negotiate successful project development agreement for new facility with third party could have similar result the operation and maintenance of nee and fpl electric generation

policy are described in note to the consolidated financial statement which were prepared under gaap critical accounting policy are those that nee belief are both most important to the portrayal of it financial condition and result of operation and require complex subjective judgment often result of the need to make estimate and assumption about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain judgment and uncertainty affecting the application of those policy may result in materially different amount being reported under different condition or using different assumption nee considers the following policy to be the most critical in understanding the judgment that are involved in preparing it consolidated financial statement accounting for derivative and hedging activitiesnee us derivative instrument primarily swap option future and forward to manage the physical and financial risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity well interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated primarily with outstanding and expected future debt issuance and borrowing in addition nee through neer us derivative to optimize the value of it power generation and gas infrastructure asset and engages in power and fuel marketing and trading activity to take advantage of expected future favorable price movement nature of accounting estimatesaccounting pronouncement require the use of fair value accounting if certain condition are met which may require significant judgment to measure the fair value of asset and liability this applies not only to traditional financial derivative instrument but to any contract having the accounting characteristic of derivative result significant judgment must be used in applying derivative accounting guidance to contract in the event change in interpretation occur it is possible that contract that currently are excluded from derivative accounting rule would have to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with change in the fair value recorded in the statement of income of contentsassumptions and accounting approachderivative instrument when required to be marked to market are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value using combination of market and income approach fair value for some of the longer term contract where liquid market are not available are derived through the use of industry standard valuation technique such internally developed model which estimate the fair value of contract by calculating the present value of the difference between the contract price and the forward price forward price represent the price at which buyer or seller could contract today to purchase or sell commodity at future date the near term forward market for electricity is generally liquid and therefore the price in the early year of the forward curve reflect observable market quote however in the later year the market is much le liquid and forward price curve must be developed using factor including the forward price for the commodity used fuel to generate electricity the expected system heat rate which measure the efficiency of power plant in converting fuel to electricity in the region where the purchase or sale take place and fundamental forecast of expected spot price based on modeled supply and demand in the region nee estimate the fair value of interest rate and foreign currency derivative using an income approach based on discounted cash flow valuation technique utilizing the net amount of estimated future cash inflow and outflow related to the derivative agreement the assumption in these model are critical since any change therein could have significant impact on the fair value of the derivative at fpl substantially all change in the fair value of energy derivative transaction are deferred regulatory asset or liability until the contract are settled and upon settlement any gain or loss are passed through the fuel clause see note in nee non rate regulated operation predominantly nextera energy resource essentially all change in the derivative fair value for power purchase and sale fuel sale and trading activity are recognized on net basis in operating revenue and the equity method investees related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in nee consolidated statement of income for interest rate and foreign currency derivative instrument all change in the derivative fair value are recognized in interest expense and the equity method investees related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in nee consolidated statement of income nee estimate the fair value of these derivative using an income approach based on discounted cash flow valuation technique utilizing observable input certain derivative transaction at neer are entered into economic hedge but the transaction do not meet the requirement for hedge accounting hedge accounting treatment is not elected or hedge accounting ha been discontinued change in the fair value of those transaction are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statement of income resulting in earnings volatility these change in fair value are reflected in the non qualifying hedge category in computing adjusted earnings and could be significant to neer result because the economic offset to the position are not marked to market consequence nee net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically linked transaction for example gain loss in the non qualifying hedge category for certain energy derivative is offset by decrease increase in the fair value of related physical asset position in the portfolio or contract which are not marked to market under gaap for this reason nee management view result expressed excluding the unrealized mark to market impact of the non qualifying hedge meaningful measure of current period performance for additional information regarding derivative instrument see note overview and energy marketing and trading and market risk sensitivity accounting for pension benefitsnee sponsor qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employee of nee and it subsidiary management belief that based on actuarial assumption and the well funded status of the pension plan nee will not be required to make any cash contribution to the qualified pension plan in the near future the qualified pension plan ha fully funded trust dedicated to providing benefit under the plan nee allocates net periodic income associated with the pension plan to it subsidiary annually using specific criterion nature of accounting estimatesfor the pension plan the benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of the december measurement date of all benefit attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered to that date the amount of benefit to be paid depends on number of future event incorporated into the pension benefit formula including an estimate of the average remaining life of employee survivor well the average year of service rendered the projected benefit obligation is measured based on assumption concerning future interest rate and future employee compensation level nee derives pension income from actuarial calculation based on the plan provision and various management assumption including discount rate rate of increase in compensation level and expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumption and accounting approachaccounting guidance requires recognition of the funded status of the pension plan in the balance sheet with change in the funded status recognized in other comprehensive income within shareholder equity in the year in which the change occur of contentssince nee is the plan sponsor and it subsidiary do not have separate right to the plan asset or direct obligation to their employee this accounting guidance is reflected at nee and not allocated to the subsidiary the portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gain and loss and prior service cost or credit that are estimated to be allocable to fpl net periodic income cost in future period and that otherwise would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are classified regulatory asset and liability at nee in accordance with regulatory treatment net periodic pension income is calculated using number of actuarial assumption those assumption for the year ended december and include salary expected long term rate of return net of investment management weighted average interest crediting in developing these assumption nee evaluated input including other qualitative and quantitative factor from it actuary and consultant well information available in the marketplace discount rate are established using the full yield curve approach in addition for the expected long term rate of return on pension plan asset nee considered different model capital market return assumption and historical return for portfolio with an equity bond asset mix similar to it pension fund well it pension fund historical compounded return nee belief that ha been reasonable long term rate of return net of investment management fee on it pension plan asset nee will continue to evaluate all of it actuarial assumption including it expected rate of return at least annually and will adjust them appropriate nee utilizes in it determination of pension income market related valuation of plan asset this market related valuation reduces year to year volatility and recognizes investment gain or loss over five year period following the year in which they occur investment gain or loss for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of plan asset and the actual return realized on those plan asset since the market related value of plan asset recognizes gain or loss over five year period the future value of plan asset will be affected previously deferred gain or loss are recognized such gain and loss together with other difference between actual result and the estimate used in the actuarial valuation are deferred and recognized in determining pension income only to the extent they exceed of the greater of projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan asset the following table illustrates the effect on net periodic pension income of changing the critical actuarial assumption discussed above while holding all other assumption constant increase decrease in periodic pension incomechange inassumptionneefpl million expected long term rate of discount salary nee also utilizes actuarial assumption about mortality to help estimate obligation of the pension plan nee ha adopted the latest revised mortality table and mortality improvement scale released by the society of actuary which did not have material impact on the pension plan obligation see note carrying value of long lived assetsnee evaluates long lived asset for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable nature of accounting estimatesthe amount of future net cash flow the timing of the cash flow and the determination of an appropriate interest rate all involve estimate and judgment about future event in particular the aggregate amount of cash flow determines whether an impairment exists and the timing of the cash flow is critical in determining fair value because each assessment is based on the fact and circumstance associated with each long lived asset the effect of change in assumption can not be generalized of contentsassumptions and accounting approachan impairment loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flow associated with that asset the impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the asset fair value in most instance the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flow using an appropriate interest rate carrying value of equity method investmentsnee evaluates it equity method investment for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate that the fair value of the investment is le than the carrying value and the investment may be other than temporarily impaired nature of accounting estimatesindicators of potential impairment include but are not limited to series of operating loss of an investee the absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity and current fair value of an investment that may be le than it carrying value if indicator of impairment exist an estimate of the investment fair value will be calculated approach for estimating fair value include among others an income approach using probability weighted discounted cash flow model and market approach using an earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ebitda multiple model the probability assigned to each scenario well the cash flow and ebitda multiple identified are critical in determining fair value assumption and accounting approachan impairment loss is required to be recognized if the impairment is deemed to be other than temporary assessment of whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired involves among other factor consideration of the length of time that the fair value is below the carrying value current expected performance relative to the expected performance when the investment wa initially made performance relative to peer industry performance relative to the economy credit rating regulatory action and legal and permitting challenge if management is unable to reasonably assert that an impairment is temporary or belief that there will not be full recovery of the carrying value of it investment the impairment is considered to be other than temporary investment that are other than temporarily impaired are written down to their estimated fair value and can not subsequently be written back up for increase in estimated fair value impairment loss are recorded in equity in earnings loss of equity method investees in nee consolidated statement

accounting guidance that requires liability for the fair value of an aro to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated with the offsetting associated asset retirement cost capitalized part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset nee aros relate primarily to decommissioning obligation of fpl and neer nuclear unit and to obligation for the dismantlement of certain of neer wind and solar facility nature of accounting estimatesthe calculation of the future cost of retiring long lived asset including nuclear decommissioning and plant dismantlement cost involves estimating the amount and timing of future expenditure and making judgment concerning whether or not such cost are considered legal obligation estimating the amount and timing of future expenditure includes among other thing making projection of when asset will be retired and ultimately decommissioned and how cost will escalate with inflation in addition nee also make interest rate and rate of return projection on it investment in determining recommended funding requirement for nuclear decommissioning cost periodically nee is required to update these estimate and projection which can affect the annual expense amount recognized the liability recorded and the annual funding requirement for nuclear decommissioning cost for example an increase of in the

that such rate will be charged and collected the fpsc ha the authority to disallow recovery of cost that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred future fpsc decision could impact the accounting for regulated operation including decision about the amount of recoverable cost and any refund that may be required result of this cost based regulation fpl follows the accounting guidance that allows regulator to create asset and impose liability based on the probability of future cash flow that would not be recorded by non rate regulated entity regulatory asset and liability represent probable future revenue that will be recovered from or refunded to customer through the ratemaking process we identified the impact of rate regulation critical audit matter due to the requirement to have auditor with deep knowledge of and significant experience with accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to it inherent complexity how the critical audit matter wa addressed in
