disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management hiring additional management and other critical personnel and increasing the scope geographic diversity and complexity of our operation effective internal control are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial report and the integration of business may create complexity in our financial system and internal control and make them more difficult to manage integration of business into our internal control system could cause to fail to meet our financial reporting obligation additionally any impairment of goodwill or other asset acquired or divested in strategic transaction or charge to earnings associated with any strategic transaction may materially reduce our earnings for example in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recognized million goodwill impairment charge on our canadian business our shareholder may react unfavorably to our strategic transaction we may not realize any anticipated benefit from such

and estimatesthe preparation of the consolidated financial statement and note to consolidated financial statement presented in this annual report requires to make estimate that affect the reported amount of asset liability sale and expense and related disclosure of contingent asset and liability we base these estimate on historical result and various other assumption believed to be reasonable all of which form the basis for making estimate concerning the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily available from other source actual result may differ from these estimate our significant accounting policy are described in note to the consolidated financial statement included herein we believe that the following accounting policy affect the most significant estimate and management judgment used in preparing the consolidated financial statement merchandise inventorydescriptionwe record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventory below cost this reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory level sale trend and historical experience during our reserve increased approximately million to million of february we also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventory this reserve is based primarily on actual shrinkage result from previous physical inventory during the inventory shrinkage reserve increased approximately million to million of february in addition we receive fund from vendor in the normal course of business principally result of purchase volume sale early payment or promotion of vendor product generally these vendor fund do not represent the reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable cost that we incurred to sell the vendor product therefore we treat these fund reduction in the cost of inventory the amount are accrued and recognize these fund reduction of cost of sale when the inventory is sold fund that are determined to be reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable cost incurred to sell vendor product are recorded an offset to the related expense judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimatewe do not believe that our merchandise inventory are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practice based on anticipated sale trend and general economic condition however change in consumer purchasing pattern or deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserve likewise change in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary based on the timing and result of physical inventory we also apply judgment in the determination of level of obsolete inventory and assumption about net realizable value for vendor fund we develop accrual rate based on the provision of the agreement in place due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreement we perform analysis and review historical purchase trend and volume throughout the year adjust accrual rate appropriate and confirm actual amount with select vendor to ensure the amount earned are appropriately recorded amount accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volume differ from projected purchase volume especially in the case of program that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volume are met effect if actual result differ from assumptionswe have not made any material change in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserve for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal year we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimate for both of these inventory reserve however it is possible that actual result could differ from recorded reserve change in either the amount of product considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately million for change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrinkage reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately million for we have not made any material change in the methodology used to recognize vendor fund during the past three fiscal year if actual result are not consistent with the assumption and estimate used we could be exposed to additional adjustment that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory however substantially all receivables associated with these activity do not require subjective long term estimate because they are collected within the following fiscal year adjustment to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material of contentslong lived asset impairmentdescriptionwe review the carrying amount of location whenever certain event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable when evaluating location for impairment our asset group is at an individual location level that is the lowest level for which cash flow are identifiable cash flow for individual location do not include an allocation of corporate overhead we evaluate location for triggering event relating to long lived asset impairment on quarterly basis to determine when location asset may not be recoverable for operating location our primary indicator that asset may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for month period for those location that have been open in the same location for sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating result management also monitor other factor when evaluating operating location for impairment including individual location execution of their operating plan and local market condition including incursion which is the opening of either other lowe location or those of direct competitor within the same market we also consider there to be triggering event when there is current expectation that it is more likely than not that given location will be closed significantly before the end of it previously estimated useful life potential impairment ha occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location asset are le than the carrying amount of the asset when determining the stream of projected future cash flow associated with an individual operating location management make assumption incorporating local market condition about key store variable including sale growth rate gross margin and controllable expense such store payroll and occupancy expense well asset residual value or lease rate an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds it fair value we use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating location which requires discounting projected future cash flow this involves making assumption regarding both location future cash flow described above and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flow we discount our cash flow estimate at rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participant would assign to the cash flow the selected market participant represent group of other retailer with market footprint similar in size to ours we use market approach to determine the fair value of our individual location identified for closure this involves making assumption regarding the estimated selling price or estimated lease rate by obtaining information from property broker or appraiser in the specific market being evaluated the information includes comparable sale of similar asset and assumption about demand in the market for purchase or lease of these asset judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimateour impairment evaluation require to apply judgment in determining whether triggering event ha occurred including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that location will be closed significantly before the end of it previously estimated useful life our impairment loss calculation require to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flow including estimated sale margin and controllable expense assumption about market performance for operating location and estimated selling price or lease rate for location identified for closure we also apply judgment in estimating asset fair value including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair value determined using an income approach effect if actual result differ from assumptionsduring fiscal year the company recorded impairment charge totaling million within selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of earnings we have not made any material change in the methodology used to estimate the future cash flow of operating location or location identified for closure during the past three fiscal year if the actual result are not consistent with the assumption and judgment we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that location will be closed significantly before the end of it useful life or in estimating future cash flow and determining asset fair value our actual impairment loss could vary positively or negatively from our estimated impairment loss in the event that our estimate vary from actual result we may record additional impairment loss which could be material to our result of operation store closing lease obligationsdescriptionwhen location under operating lease are closed we recognize liability for the fair value of future contractual obligation associated with the leased location the fair value of the store closing lease obligation is determined using an expected present of contentsvalue cash flow model incorporating future minimum lease payment property tax utility common area maintenance and other ongoing expense net of estimated sublease income and other recoverable item discounted at credit adjusted risk free rate the expected present value cash flow model us probability weighted scenario approach that assigns varying cash flow to certain scenario based on the expected likelihood of outcome estimating the fair value involves making assumption regarding estimated sublease income by obtaining information from property broker or appraiser in the specific market being evaluated the information includes comparable lease rate of similar asset and assumption about demand in the market for leasing these asset subsequent change to the liability including change resulting from revision to either the timing or the amount of estimated cash flow are recognized in the period of the change judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimateour store closing lease liability calculation require to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flow primarily related to estimated sublease income and the selection of an appropriate discount rate effect if actual result differ from assumptionsduring store under operating lease were closed we recorded million of expense for store closing lease obligation during these charge include million related to new liability recorded during and million of adjustment related to previously recorded liability we have not made any material change in the methodology used to estimate the expected future cash flow of closed location under operating lease during the past three fiscal year if the actual result are not consistent with the assumption and judgment we have made in estimating expected future cash flow our store closing lease obligation loss could vary positively or negatively from our estimated loss change in the store closing lease liability would have affected net earnings by approximately million for fiscal year goodwilldescriptiongoodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at least annually on the first day of the fourth quarter or whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may not be recoverable we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below the operating segment level the evaluation begin with qualitative assessment to determine whether quantitative impairment test is necessary if after assessing qualitative factor we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is le than the carrying amount then the quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary the quantitative goodwill impairment test used to identify both the existence of impairment and the amount of impairment loss compare the fair value of reporting unit with it carrying amount including goodwill fair value represents the price market participant would be willing to pay in potential sale of the reporting unit and is based on combination of an income approach based on discounted future cash flow and market approach based on market multiple applied to free cash flow if the fair value exceeds carrying value then no goodwill impairment ha occurred if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds it fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit the income tax effect from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit if applicable is considered in determining the goodwill impairment loss judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimatethe determination of the fair value of the reporting unit requires to make significant estimate and assumption including store growth rate existing store sale growth rate forecasting expense and selecting appropriate discount rate effect if actual result differ from assumptionsduring the fourth quarter of fiscal year we determined our canadian retail and canadian distribution reporting unit were impaired we recorded an impairment loss related to the canadian reporting unit of million within selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of earnings which represents the entire amount of goodwill allocated to these reporting unit the carrying value of goodwill of february wa million the fair value of the home improvement reporting unit is substantially in excess of the carrying value and we therefore do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in the future estimate or assumption we use to test for impairment loss on goodwill however if actual result are not consistent with our estimate or assumption we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material of contentsself insurancedescriptionwe are self insured for certain loss relating to worker compensation automobile general and product liability extended protection plan and certain medical and dental claim our self insured retention or deductible applicable is limited to million per occurrence involving worker compensation million per occurrence involving general or product liability and million per occurrence involving automobile we do not have any insurance coverage for self insured extended protection plan or medical and dental claim self insurance claim filed and claim incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimate of the discounted ultimate cost for self insured

well the frequency lag and severity of claim effect if actual result differ from assumptionswe have not made any material change in the methodology used to establish our self insurance liability during the past three fiscal year although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate loss related to claim it is possible that actual result could differ from recorded self insurance
