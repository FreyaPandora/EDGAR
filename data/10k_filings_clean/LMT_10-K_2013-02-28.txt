for space system include sandia corporation which manages and operates sandia national laboratory for the department of energy competition our broad portfolio of product and service competes the product and service of other large aerospace defense and information technology company well numerous smaller competitor particularly in the is segment we often form team with other company that are competitor in other effort to provide customer with the best mix of capability to address specific requirement in area of our business customer requirement are changing to encourage expanded competition such information technology contract may be wide range of small to large contractor bidding on procurement principal factor of competition include value of our product and service to the customer technical and management capability the ability to develop and implement complex integrated system architecture financing and total cost of ownership release of technology our demonstrated ability to execute and perform against contract requirement and our ability to provide timely solution the competition for foreign sale is subject to additional government stipulation export restriction market access technology transfer industrial cooperation and contracting practice we may compete against domestic and foreign company or team for contract award by other government international competition also may be subject to different law or contracting practice of other government that may affect we structure our bid for the procurement in many international procurement the purchasing government relationship with the and it industrial cooperation program are also important factor in determining the outcome of competition it is common for international customer to require contractor to comply with industrial cooperation regulation sometimes referred to offset requirement and we have undertaken foreign offset agreement part of securing some international business for more information concerning offset agreement see contractual commitment and balance sheet arrangement in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation patent we routinely apply for and substantial number of and international patent related to the product and service we provide in addition to owning large portfolio of intellectual property we also license intellectual property to and from third party the government ha license in our patent that are developed in performance of government contract and it may use or authorize others to use the invention covered by our patent for government purpose unpatented research development and engineering skill also make an important contribution to our business although our intellectual property right in the aggregate are important to the operation of our business we not believe that any existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that it loss or termination would have material adverse effect on our business taken whole raw material and seasonality aspect of our business require relatively scarce raw material historically we have been successful in obtaining the raw material and other supply needed in our manufacturing process we seek to manage raw material supply risk through long term contract and by maintaining stock of key material in inventory aluminum and titanium are important raw material used in certain of our aeronautics and space system program long term agreement have helped enable continued supply of aluminum and titanium carbon fiber is an important ingredient in the composite material that is used in our aeronautics program such the aircraft aluminum lithium which we use for aircraft structural component is currently only available from limited source we have been advised by some supplier that pricing and the timing of availability of material in some commodity market can fluctuate widely fluctuation may negatively affect price and the availability of certain material while we do not anticipate material problem regarding the supply of our raw material and believe that we have taken appropriate measure to mitigate these variation if key material become unavailable or if pricing fluctuates widely in the future it could result in delay of one or more of our program increased cost or reduced profit table of content no material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal various factor can affect the distribution of our sale between accounting period including the timing of government award the availability of government funding product delivery and customer acceptance government contract and regulation our business is heavily regulated we contract with numerous government agency and entity including all branch of the military the department of defense homeland security justice commerce health and human service transportation and energy the postal service the social security administration the federal aviation administration nasa and the environmental protection agency similar government authority exist in other country and regulate our international effort we must comply with and are affected by law and regulation relating to the formation administration and performance of government and other contract these law and regulation among other thing require certification and disclosure of all cost or pricing data in connection with certain type of contract negotiation impose specific and unique cost accounting practice that may differ from generally accepted accounting principle impose acquisition regulation which may change or be replaced time that define allowable and unallowable cost and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement certain cost based government contract restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purpose and the export of certain product service and technical data and require the review and approval of contractor business system defined in the regulation accounting ii estimating iii earned value management system evms for managing cost and schedule performance on

management system for more information regarding government contracting law and regulation see item risk factor well industry consideration and critical accounting policy contract accounting sale recognition in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation portion of our business is classified by the government and can not be specifically described the operating result of these classified program are included in our consolidated financial statement the business risk associated with classified program historically have not differed materially from those of our other government program the internal control addressing the financial reporting of classified program are consistent with the internal control practice for non classified contract backlog at december our backlog wa billion compared with billion at december backlog is converted into sale in future period work is performed or delivery are made approximately billion or of our total year end backlog is expected to be converted into sale in our backlog includes both funded unfilled firm order for our product and service for which funding ha been both authorized and appropriated by the customer congress in the case of government agency and unfunded firm order for which funding ha not been appropriated amount we do not include unexercised option or potential indefinite delivery indefinite quantity order in our backlog if any of our contract were to be terminated our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining term of such contract funded backlog wa billion at december compared to billion at december for backlog related to each of our business segment see business segment result of operation in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation research and development we conduct research and development activity under customer funded contract and with our own independent research and development fund our independent research and development cost include basic research applied research table of content development system and other concept formulation study generally these cost are allocated among all contract and program in progress under government contractual arrangement cost we incur under customer sponsored research and development program pursuant to contract are included in net sale and cost of sale under certain arrangement in which customer share in product development cost our portion of the unreimbursed cost is expensed incurred in cost of sale independent research and development cost charged to cost of sale were million in million in and million in see research and development and similar cost in note significant accounting policy of our consolidated financial statement employee at december we about employee approximately of were located in the we have continuing need for numerous skilled and professional personnel to meet contract schedule and obtain new and ongoing order for our product the majority of our employee posse security clearance the demand for worker with security clearance have specialized engineering information technology and technical skill within the aerospace defense and information technology industry is likely to remain high for the foreseeable future while growth of the pool of trained individual with those skill ha not matched demand result we are competing with other company with similar need in hiring skilled employee approximately of our employee are covered by any one of approximately separate collective bargaining agreement with various union number of our existing collective bargaining agreement expire in any given year historically we have been successful in renegotiating expiring agreement without any material disruption of operating activity management considers employee relation to be good forward looking statement this form contains statement which to the extent that are not recitation of historical fact constitute forward looking statement within the meaning of the federal security law and are based on our current expectation and assumption the word believe estimate anticipate project intend expect plan outlook scheduled forecast and similar expression are intended to identify forward looking statement statement and assumption with respect to future sale income and cash flow program performance the outcome of litigation environmental remediation cost estimate and planned acquisition or disposition of asset are example of forward looking statement numerous factor including potentially the risk factor described in the following section could affect our forward looking statement and actual performance our future financial result likely will be different from those projected due to the inherent nature of projection and may be better or worse than expected given these uncertainty you should not rely on forward looking statement the forward looking statement contained in this form speak only of the date of this form we expressly disclaim duty to provide update to forward looking statement after the date of this form to reflect the occurrence of subsequent event changed circumstance change in our expectation or the estimate and assumption associated with the forward looking statement in this form are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by the federal security law item risk factor an investment in our common stock or debt security involves risk and uncertainty we seek to identify manage and mitigate risk to our business risk and uncertainty can not be eliminated or necessarily predicted you should consider the following factor carefully in addition to the other information contained in this form deciding to purchase our security we depend heavily on government contract our program could be materially reduced extended or terminated result of the government continuing assessment of priority change in government priority the implementation of sequestration or other budget cut intended to avoid sequestration these matter and or delay in the budget process including continuing resolution could adversely affect our ability to grow or maintain our sale earnings and cash flow we derived of our consolidated net sale from government customer in including from the department of defense dod we expect to continue to derive most of our sale from work performed under government contract those contract are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriation congress usually appropriates fund on fiscal year basis even though contract performance may extend over many year table of content the program in which we participate must compete with other program and policy imperative for consideration during the budget and appropriation process concern about increased deficit spending along with continued economic challenge continue to place pressure on and international customer budget while we believe that our program are well aligned with national defense and other priority shift in domestic and international spending and tax policy change in security defense and intelligence priority the affordability of our product and service general economic condition and development and other factor may affect decision to fund or the level of funding for existing or proposed program should congress and the administration fail to change or delay the pending sequestration of appropriation in government fiscal year gfy imposed by the budget control act of budget act scheduled to take effect on march our customer budget would be reduced significantly and there would be direct and significant reduction in our customer contract award while we understand customer have started to plan for sequestration the specific effect of sequestration are not yet available and can not be determined by the automatic across the board cut from sequestration would approximately double the amount of the ten year billion reduction in defense spending that began in gfy already required by the budget act including the budget for overseas contingency operation and any unobligated balance from prior year and would have significant consequence to our business and industry non dod agency would also have significantly reduced budget there would be disruption of ongoing program impact to our supply chain contractual action including partial or complete termination potential facility closure and thousand of personnel reduction across the industry that would severely impact advanced manufacturing operation and engineering expertise and accelerate the loss of skill and knowledge consequently we expect that sequestration or other budgetary cut in lieu of sequestration would have material effect on our corporation for more information regarding sequestration see industry consideration in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation under such condition large or complex program which consist of multiple contract and phase are potentially subject to increased scrutiny our largest program the represented of our total consolidated net sale in and is expected to represent higher percentage of our sale in future year for more information regarding the program see status of program in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation based upon our diverse range of defense homeland security and information technology product and service we believe that this make it le likely that cut in any specific contract or program will have long term effect on our business however termination of multiple or large program or contract could adversely affect our business and future financial performance we could incur expense beyond those that would be reimbursed if one or more of our existing contract were terminated for convenience due to lack of funding or other reason potential change in funding priority may afford new or additional opportunity for our business in term of existing follow on or replacement program while we would expect to compete and be well positioned the incumbent on existing program we may not be successful or the replacement program may be funded at lower level in year the government not complete it budget process before the end of it fiscal year september government operation typically are funded through continuing resolution that authorizes agency of the government to continue to operate but doe not authorize new spending initiative when the government operates under continuing resolution delay can occur in contract award due to lack of funding the government is currently operating under continuing resolution that is effective through march and it budget for gfy ha not been finalized historically this ha not had material effect on our business although we experience decrease in contract award and sale at our is business segment during the fourth quarter of due to the continued downturn in federal information technology budget impacted by the continuing resolution should the continuing resolution be prolonged further or extended through the entire government fiscal year or decision regarding sequestration remain pending it may cause additional government contract award to shift and cause our result of operation to vary between period in limited circumstance we may continue to work without funding and use our fund in order to meet our customer desired delivery date for product or service such fund could be at risk if the government doe not provide authorization and additional funding to our program we are subject to number of procurement law and regulation our business and our reputation could be adversely affected if we fail to comply with these law we must comply with and are affected by law and regulation relating to the award administration and performance of government contract government contract law and regulation affect how we do business with our customer and impose certain risk and cost on our business violation of specific law and regulation could harm our reputation and result in the imposition of fine and penalty the termination of our contract debarment from bidding on contract loss of our ability to export product or service and civil or criminal investigation or proceeding table of content in some instance these law and regulation impose term or right that are different than those typically found in commercial transaction for example the government may terminate any of our government contract and subcontract either at it convenience or for default based on performance upon termination for convenience of fixed price type contract we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered item reimbursement for allowable cost for work in process and an allowance for profit on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in loss upon termination for convenience of cost reimbursable contract we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable cost plus portion of the fee allowable cost would include our cost to terminate agreement with our supplier and subcontractor the amount of the fee recovered if any is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation we attempt to ensure that adequate fund are available by notifying the customer when it estimated cost including those associated with possible termination for convenience approach level specified being allotted to it program fund are typically appropriated on fiscal year basis and the cost of termination for convenience may exceed the cost of continuing program in given fiscal year occasionally program do not have sufficient fund appropriated to cover the termination cost were the government to terminate them for convenience under such circumstance the government could assert that it is not required to appropriate additional funding termination arising of our default may expose to liability and have material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contract and order in addition on those contract for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor the government could terminate prime contract under which we are subcontractor notwithstanding the quality of our service subcontractor in the case of termination for default the government could make claim to reduce the contract value or recover it procurement cost and could ass other special penalty however under such circumstance we have right and remedial action under law and federal acquisition regulation far in addition certain of our government contract span one or more base year and multiple option year the government generally ha the right not to exercise option period and may not exercise an option period for various reason however the government may exercise option period even for contract for which it is expected that our cost may exceed the contract price or ceiling government agency including the defense contract audit agency the defense contract management agency dcma and various agency inspector general routinely audit and investigate government contractor these agency review contractor performance under it contract it cost structure it business system and compliance with applicable law regulation and standard any cost found to be misclassified may be subject to repayment we have unaudited and or unsettled incurred cost claim related to past year which place risk on our ability to issue final billing on contract for which authorized and appropriated fund may be expiring certain deficiency identified during government audit of contractor business system may result in the government withholding payment on receivables for certain contract type such cost reimbursable contract and fixed price incentive fee contract withholds are capped at of billing when deficiency impact single business system and when deficiency impact multiple system and are typically reduced to after the contractor corrective action plan ha been accepted and progress to implement the corrective action ha been demonstrated such deficiency have not impacted our internal control over financial reporting for example the government is currently withholding certain fund on receivables for the program due to the dcma prior withdrawal of it validation and determination of compliance of the earned value management system at our fort worth texas location in the dcma conducted compliance review and concluded that although we have made notable progress toward compliance additional corrective action are necessary to achieve full compliance if an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activity we may be subject to civil or criminal penalty and administrative sanction including termination of contract forfeiture of profit suspension of payment fine and suspension or prohibition from business with the government in addition we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegation of impropriety were made against similar government oversight exists in most other country where we conduct business table of content increased competition and bid protest in budget constrained environment may make it more difficult to maintain our financial performance leader in defense and global security we have large number of program for which we are the incumbent contractor substantial portion of our business is awarded through competitive bidding the government increasingly ha relied upon competitive contract award type including indefinite delivery indefinite quantity gsa schedule and other multi award contract which ha the potential to create pricing pressure and increase our cost by requiring that we submit multiple bid and proposal the competitive bidding process entail substantial cost and managerial time to prepare bid and proposal for contract that may not be awarded to or may be split among competitor following award we may encounter significant expense delay contract modification or even loss of the contract if our competitor protest or challenge contract that are awarded to multi award contract require that we make sustained effort to obtain task order under the contract we are facing increased competition particularly in information technology and cyber security at our information system global solution business segment from non traditional competitor outside of the aerospace and defense industry at the time our customer are facing budget constraint trying to do more with le by cutting cost identifying more affordable solution and reducing product development cycle to remain competitive we consistently must provide superior performance advanced technology solution and service at an affordable cost and with the agility that our customer require to satisfy their mission objective international sale may pose different risk in our sale to international customer accounted for of our total consolidated net sale company we have strategy to grow international sale over the next several year inclusive of sale of aircraft to our international partner and other country international sale are subject to numerous political and economic factor regulatory requirement significant competition and other risk associated with doing business in foreign country our exposure to such risk may increase if our international sale grow we anticipate our international business is conducted through foreign military sale fm contracted through the government or direct commercial sale dc with international customer in approximately half of our sale to international customer were fm while the other half were dc these transaction type differ fm transaction represent sale by the government to other government and our contract with the government is subject to far by contrast dc transaction represent sale by directly to another government or international customer all sale to international customer are subject to and foreign law and regulation including without limitation regulation relating to import export control technology transfer restriction taxation repatriation of earnings exchange control the foreign corrupt practice act and certain other anti corruption law and the anti boycott provision of the export administration act we frequently team with international subcontractor and supplier who are also exposed to similar risk while we have stringent policy in place to comply with such law and regulation failure by our employee or others working on our behalf to comply with these law and regulation could result in administrative civil or criminal liability including suspension or debarment from government contract or suspension of our export privilege which could have material adverse effect on while international sale whether contracted fm or dc present risk that are different and potentially greater than those encountered in our domestic business dc may impose even greater risk such transaction involve commercial relationship with party with whom we have le familiarity and where there may be significant cultural difference additionally international procurement rule and regulation contract law and regulation and contractual term differ from those in the are le familiar to may be interpreted differently by foreign court are officially documented in the local language and therefore potentially subject to error in translation and frequently have term le favorable to than the far export and import tax and currency risk may also be increased for dc transaction our international business is highly sensitive to change in regulation political environment or security risk may affect our ability to conduct business in foreign market including those regarding investment procurement taxation and repatriation of earnings our international business may also be impacted by change in foreign national priority and government budget and may be further impacted by global economic condition and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate sale of military product are also affected by defense budget both in the and abroad and foreign policy in international sale we face substantial competition from both domestic manufacturer and foreign manufacturer whose government sometimes provide research and development assistance marketing subsidy and other assistance for their product additionally the timing of order from our international customer can be le predictable than for our domestic customer and may lead to fluctuation in the amount reported each year for our international sale table of content in conjunction with defense procurement some international customer require contractor to provide additional incentive or to comply with industrial cooperation regulation including entering into industrial cooperation agreement sometimes referred to offset agreement offset agreement may require in country purchase technology transfer local manufacturing support and financial support project an incentive or condition to contract award in some country these offset agreement may require the establishment of joint venture with local company which must control the venture in these and other situation lockheed martin could be liable for violation of law for action taken by these entity such law related to anti corruption import and export anti boycott restriction or local law with which we are not familiar offset agreement generally extend over several year and may provide for penalty in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirement which are typically subjective our business involves significant risk and uncertainty that may not be covered by indemnity or insurance significant portion of our business relates to designing developing and manufacturing advanced defense and technology system and product new technology may be untested or unproven failure of some of these product and service could result in extensive loss of life or property damage accordingly we also may incur liability that are unique to our product and service including combat and air mobility aircraft missile and space system command and control system air traffic control management system cyber security homeland security and training program in some but not all circumstance we may be entitled to certain legal protection or indemnification from our customer either through government indemnification under public law qualification of our product and service by the department of homeland security under the safety act provision of the homeland security act of contractual provision or otherwise the amount of insurance coverage that we maintain may not be adequate to cover all claim or liability existing coverage may be cancelled while we remain exposed to the risk and it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risk and liability substantial claim resulting from an accident failure of our product or service or other incident or liability arising from our product and service in excess of any indemnity and our insurance coverage or for which indemnity or insurance is not available or not obtained could adversely impact our financial condition cash flow or operating result any accident even if fully indemnified or insured could negatively affect our reputation among our customer and the public and make it more difficult for to compete effectively it also could affect the cost and availability of adequate insurance in the future our profitability and cash flow may vary based on the mix of our contract and program our performance our ability to control cost and evolving government procurement policy our profitability and cash flow may vary materially depending on the type of long term government contract undertaken the nature of the product produced or service performed under those contract the cost incurred in performing the work the achievement of other performance objective and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fee is finally determined particularly under award and incentive fee contract our backlog includes variety of contract type which are intended to address changing risk and reward profile program matures contract type include cost reimbursable fixed price incentive fee fixed price and time and material contract contract for development program with complex design and technical challenge are typically cost reimbursable under cost reimbursable contract we are reimbursed for allowable cost and paid fee which may be fixed or performance based in these case the associated financial risk primarily relate to reduction in fee and the program could be cancelled if cost schedule or technical performance issue arise other contract in backlog are for the transition from development to production low rate initial production lrip which includes the challenge of starting and stabilizing manufacturing production and test line while the final design is being validated these generally are cost reimbursable or fixed price incentive fee contract under fixed price incentive fee contract the allowable cost incurred are eligible for reimbursement but are subject to cost share arrangement which affect profitability generally if our cost exceed the contract target cost or are not allowable under the applicable regulation we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all cost and may have our fee reduced or eliminated there are also contract for production well operation and maintenance of the delivered product that have the challenge of achieving stable production and delivery rate while maintaining operability of the product after delivery these contract are mainly fixed price although some operation and maintenance contract are time and material type under fixed price contract we receive fixed price despite the actual cost we incur we have to absorb any cost in excess of the fixed price under time and material contract we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rate and for certain expense table of content the failure to perform to customer expectation and contract requirement may result in reduced fee or loss and affect our financial performance in that period under each type of contract if we are unable to control cost our operating result could be adversely affected particularly if we are unable to justify an increase in contract value to our customer cost overrun or the failure to perform on existing program also may adversely affect our ability to retain existing program and win future contract award the government is currently pursuing and implementing policy that could negatively impact our profitability change in procurement policy favoring more incentive based fee arrangement different award fee criterion or government contract negotiation offer that indicate our cost should be may affect the predictability of our profit rate our customer are under pressure that may result in change in contract type referenced above earlier in program maturity than is traditional an example of this is the use of fixed price incentive fee contract for the lrip and lrip contract on the program while the development contract is running concurrently our customer may also pursue non traditional contract provision in negotiation of contract for example change resulting from the development contract may need to be implemented on the production contract concept referred to concurrency which may require to pay for portion of the concurrency cost other example include but are not limited to the government in certain circumstance requiring that bid and proposal cost be included in general and administrative cost rather than charged directly to contract and potentially lowering the cap on the recoverability of executive compensation other policy could negatively impact our working capital and cash flow for example the government ha expressed preference for requiring progress payment provision on new fixed price contract which if implemented delay our ability to recover significant amount of cost incurred on contract and thus affect the timing of our cash flow we are the prime contractor on most of our contract and if our subcontractor supplier or teaming agreement or joint venture partner fail to perform their obligation our performance and our ability to win future business could be harmed most of our contract involve subcontract or teaming arrangement with other company upon which we rely to perform portion of the service that we must provide to our customer we also sometimes bid on contract through joint venture that award work through these entity rather than through subcontract or teaming arrangement there is risk that we may have dispute with our subcontractor teammate or venture member including dispute regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed the workshare provided to that party customer concern about the other party performance our failure to extend existing task order or issue new task order or our hiring of the personnel of subcontractor teammate or venture member or vice versa in addition the contracting party on which we rely may be affected by change in the economic environment and constraint on available financing to meet their performance requirement or provide needed supply on timely basis failure by one or more of those contracting party to provide the agreed upon supply or perform the agreed upon service on timely basis may affect our ability to perform our obligation contracting party performance deficiency may affect our operating result and could result in customer terminating our contract for default default termination could expose to liability and affect our ability to compete for future contract and order the funding and cost associated with our pension and postretirement medical plan are dependent on economic factor such discount rate and long term rate of return on our plan asset well other actuarial assumption which may cause our earnings cash flow and stockholder equity to fluctuate significantly from year to year many of our employee are covered by defined benefit pension plan and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefit to eligible retiree the impact of these plan on our generally accepted accounting principle gaap earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record for our postretirement benefit plan may materially change from year to year those calculation are sensitive to funding level well change in several key economic assumption including interest rate rate of return on plan asset and other actuarial assumption including expected rate of increase in future compensation level employee turnover and mortality well the timing of funding change in these factor also affect our plan funding cash flow earnings and stockholder equity in addition the funding of our plan and recovery of cost on our contract described may also be subject to change caused by legislative or regulatory action with regard to cash flow in the past year we have made substantial cash contribution to our plan in excess of the amount required by the employee retirement income security act of erisa and pension protection act ppa we generally are able to recover these cost related to our plan allowable cost on our government contract including fm but there are delay between when we contribute cash to the plan under pension funding rule and recover it under government cost accounting rule effective february the cost accounting rule were revised to harmonize the table of content measurement and period assignment of the pension cost allocable to government contract with the ppa ca harmonization the cost impact of ca harmonization will be phased in beginning in with the goal of better aligning the ca cost and erisa funding requirement being fully achieved in for more information on how these factor could impact earnings financial position cash flow and stockholder equity see critical accounting policy postretirement benefit plan in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation and note postretirement plan of our consolidated financial statement if we fail to manage acquisition divestiture and other transaction successfully our financial result business and future prospect could be harmed in pursuing our business strategy we routinely conduct discussion evaluate target and enter into agreement regarding possible acquisition divestiture joint venture and equity investment we seek to identify acquisition or investment opportunity that will expand or complement our existing product and service or customer base at attractive valuation we often compete with others for the same opportunity to be successful we must conduct due diligence to identify valuation issue and potential loss contingency negotiate transaction term complete and close complex transaction and manage post closing matter integrate acquired company and employee and realize anticipated operating synergy efficiently and effectively acquisition divestiture joint venture and investment transaction often require substantial management resource and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business unidentified pre closing liability could affect our future financial result joint venture or equity investment operate under shared control with other party under the equity method of accounting for nonconsolidated joint venture and investment we recognize our share of the operating result of these venture in our result of operation our operating result may be affected by the performance of business over which we do not exercise control the most significant impact of our equity investment is in our space system business segment where approximately of it operating profit wa derived from it equity investment in three joint venture see space system above management closely monitor the result of operation and cash flow generated by these investees our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threat or other disruption defense contractor we face cyber threat threat to the physical security of our facility and employee and terrorist act well the potential for business disruption associated with information technology failure natural disaster or public health crisis we routinely experience cyber security threat threat to our information technology infrastructure and attempt to gain access to our company sensitive information do our customer supplier subcontractor and joint venture partner we may experience similar security threat at customer site that we operate and manage contractual requirement prior cyber attack directed at have not had material impact on our financial result and we believe our threat detection and mitigation process and procedure are adequate the threat we face vary from attack common to most industry to more advanced and persistent highly organized adversary who target because we protect national security information if we are unable to protect sensitive information our customer or governmental authority could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection process and procedure due to the evolving nature of these security threat however the impact of any future incident can not be predicted although we work cooperatively with our customer supplier subcontractor joint venture partner and acquisition to seek to minimize the impact of cyber threat other security threat or business disruption we must rely on the safeguard put in place by these entity which may affect the security of our information these entity have varying level of cyber security expertise and safeguard and their relationship with government contractor such lockheed martin may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber threat we face the cost related to cyber or other security threat or disruption may not be fully insured or indemnified by other mean occurrence of any of these event could adversely affect

product and service our future financial result our reputation or our stock price table of content environmental cost could affect our future earnings well the affordability of our product and service our operation are subject to and affected by variety of federal state local and foreign environmental protection law and regulation we are involved in environmental response at some of our facility and former facility and at third party site not owned by where we have been designated potentially responsible party by the environmental protection agency epa or by state agency in addition we could be affected by future regulation imposed in response to concern over climate change other aspect of the environment or natural resource and by other action commonly referred to green initiative we have an ongoing comprehensive program to reduce the effect of our operation on the environment we manage various government owned facility on behalf of the government at such facility environmental compliance and remediation cost historically have been the responsibility of the government and we have relied and continue to rely with respect to past practice upon government funding to pay such cost although the government remains responsible for capital and operating cost associated with environmental compliance responsibility for fine and penalty associated with environmental noncompliance typically are borne by either the government or the contractor depending on the contract and the relevant fact some environmental law include criminal provision an environmental law conviction could affect our ability to be awarded future or perform existing government contract we have incurred and will continue to incur liability under various federal state local and foreign statute for environmental protection and remediation the extent of our financial exposure can not in all case be reasonably estimated at this time among the variable management must ass in evaluating cost associated with these case and remediation site generally are the status of site assessment extent of the contamination impact on natural resource changing cost estimate evolution of technology used to remediate the site and continually evolving governmental environmental standard and cost allowability issue both the epa and the california office of environmental health hazard assessment announced plan in january to regulate two chemical perchlorate and hexavalent chromium to level in drinking water that are expected to be substantially lower than the existing public health goal or standard established in california the rulemaking process are lengthy and may take year to complete if substantially lower standard are adopted we would expect material increase in our estimate for environmental liability and the related asset for the portion of the increased cost that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our product and service for the government the amount that would be allocable to our non government contract or that is determined to be unallowable for pricing under government contract would be expensed which may have material effect on our earnings in any

proceeding and note legal proceeding commitment and contingency of our consolidated financial statement in order to be successful we must attract and retain key employee and manage leadership transition effectively our business ha continuing need to attract large number of skilled personnel including personnel holding security clearance to support the growth of the enterprise and to replace individual who have terminated employment due to retirement or other reason to the extent that the demand for qualified personnel exceeds supply we could experience higher labor recruiting or training cost in order to attract and retain such employee or could experience difficulty in performing under our contract if our need for such employee were unmet we increasingly compete with commercial technology company outside of the aerospace and defense industry for qualified technical and scientific position the number of qualified domestic engineer is decreasing to the extent that these company grow faster than our industry or face fewer cost and product pricing constraint they may be able to offer higher compensation to job candidate or our existing employee to the extent that we lose experienced personnel through wage competition normal attrition or specific action such workforce reduction we must successfully manage the transfer of critical knowledge from those individual table of content we also must manage leadership development and succession planning throughout our business and have process in place for management transition which wa critical during our recent executive management change to the extent that we are unable to attract develop retain and protect leadership talent successfully we could experience business disruption and impair our ability to achieve business objective historically where employee are covered by collective bargaining agreement with various union we have been successful in negotiating renewal to expiring agreement without any material disruption of operating activity this doe not assure however that we will be successful in our effort to negotiate renewal of our existing collective bargaining agreement when they expire if we were unsuccessful in those effort there is the potential that we could incur unanticipated delay or expense in the program affected by any resulting work stoppage our estimate and projection may prove to be inaccurate the accounting for some of our most significant activity is based on judgment and estimate which are complex and subject to many variable for example accounting for sale using the percentage of completion method requires that we ass risk and make assumption regarding schedule cost technical and performance issue for each of our thousand of contract many of which are long term in nature another example is the billion of goodwill asset recorded on our balance sheet of december from previous acquisition over time which represent greater than of our total asset and are subject to annual impairment testing if we experience change or factor arise that negatively affect the expected cash flow of reporting unit we may be required to write off all or portion of the related goodwill asset change in or foreign tax law including possibly with retroactive effect and audit by tax authority could result in unanticipated increase in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flow for example recent proposal to lower the corporate income tax rate would require to reduce our net deferred tax asset upon enactment of the related tax legislation with corresponding material one time increase to income tax expense but our income tax expense and payment would be materially reduced in subsequent year actual financial result could differ from our

business overview we are global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research design development manufacture integration and sustainment of advanced technology system and product we also provide broad range of management engineering technical scientific logistic and information service we serve both domestic and international customer with product and service that have defense civil and commercial application with our principal customer being agency of the government in of our billion in net sale were from the government either prime contractor or subcontractor including from the department of defense dod were from international customer including foreign military sale fm contracted through the government and were from commercial and other customer our main area of focus are in defense space intelligence homeland security and information technology including cyber security we organize our business segment based on the nature of the product and service offered effective december we operate in five business segment aeronautics information system global solution is missile and fire control mfc mission system and training mst and space system this structure reflects the reorganization of our former electronic system business segment into the new mfc and mst business segment in order to streamline our operation and enhance customer alignment in connection with this reorganization management layer at our former electronic system business segment and our former global training and logistics gtl business were eliminated and the former gtl business wa split between the two new business segment in addition operating result for sandia corporation which manages the sandia national laboratory for the department of energy and our equity interest in the atomic weapon establishment awe joint venture were transferred from our former electronic system business segment to our space system business segment the amount discussion and presentation of our business segment reflect this reorganization for all year presented in this annual report on form we are operating in an environment that is characterized by both increasing complexity in global security well continuing economic pressure in the and globally significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our product and service and placing more security capability quickly into the hand of both our domestic and international customer at affordable price recognizing that our customer are resource constrained we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio in disciplined manner with focus on adjacent market close to our core capability despite the challenge we face we expect to continue to invest in technology to fulfill new mission requirement for our customer invest in our people so that we have the technical skill necessary to be successful in this environment and return at least of free cash to investor in the form of dividend and share repurchase our outlook for is premised on the assumption that sequestration doe not occur that the government continues to support and fund our program which is consistent with the continuing resolution funding measure through march and that congress approves defense budget legislation for government fiscal year gfy at level consistent with the president proposed defense budget for the second half of the government fiscal year with these assumption we expect net sale will decline at mid single digit percentage rate from the record net sale amount due to an anticipated reduction in net sale at four of five of our business segment discussed in the business segment result of operation section below we expect our segment operating profit will also decrease from level at slightly higher percentage rate than the decline in net sale due to the factor mentioned in the business segment result of operation section below and segment operating profit margin will accordingly be slightly lower than level if sequestration or other budgetary cut in lieu of sequestration occur we expect these budget reduction would have material effect on our corporation discussed in the industry consideration section below and item risk factor industry consideration government business budget priority the government continues to focus on discretionary spending entitlement tax and other initiative to stimulate the economy create job and reduce the deficit the administration and congress are attempting to balance decision we define free cash flow cash from operation determined under generally accepted accounting principle gaap le capital expenditure presented on our statement of cash flow table of content regarding defense homeland security and other federal spending priority in constrained fiscal environment imposed by the budget control act of budget act which reduced defense spending by minimum of billion over ten year period that began in gfy in light of the budget act and deficit reduction pressure generally it is likely that discretionary spending by the federal government will remain constrained for number of year notably should congress and the administration fail to change or further delay the pending sequestration of appropriation in gfy imposed by the budget act currently scheduled to take effect on march adjusted by the american taxpayer relief act of taxpayer relief act both our dod and non dod customer budget would be reduced significantly and there would be direct and significant reduction in our customer contract award although the taxpayer relief act delayed sequestration two month from january to march and reduced the amount of the gfy budget cut the impact to our customer remain significant with limited time to implement spending reduction required under sequestration in addition congress passed continuing resolution funding measure for gfy to finance all government activity through march under this continuing resolution partial year funding at amount consistent with appropriated level for gfy are available subject to certain restriction but new spending initiative are not authorized our key program continue to be supported and funded under the continuing resolution financing mechanism however during period covered by continuing resolution or the regular appropriation bill are passed and pending decision related to sequestration we may experience delay in the receipt of order for our product and service due to lack of funding and those delay may affect our result of operation and cash flow while the specific effect of sequestration still can not be determined automatic across the board cut would approximately double the amount of the ten year billion reduction in defense spending that began in gfy already required by the budget act including the budget for overseas contingency operation oco and any unobligated balance from prior year and would have significant consequence to our business and industry non dod agency would also have significantly reduced budget there would be disruption of ongoing program impact to our supply chain contractual action including partial or complete termination potential facility closure and thousand of personnel reduction across the industry that would severely impact advanced manufacturing operation and engineering expertise and accelerate the loss of skill and knowledge current estimate suggest that sequestration would reduce total gfy non military personnel defense funding by to approximately billion in addition general estimate suggest that sequestration could result in an approximate reduction to the total gfy non defense budget however if sequestration go into effect on march government agency will have already expended fund for several month of gfy therefore in order to achieve the across the board cut imposed by sequestration over shorter time period the effective percentage reduction for the remaining month of gfy would be higher than the above percentage while current dod planning for the ongoing continuing resolution ha focused on operating account in lieu of other account such procurement and research development training and evaluation due to the ability to quickly adjust activity and program funded in these account we understand that sequestration related cut are likely to be applied across the board at the individual program project and activity level thus impacting all defense program and contractor regardless of how they align to our country most critical national priority and mission area consequently we expect that sequestration or other budgetary cut in lieu of sequestration would have material effect on our corporation our current sale outlook for is mid single digit percentage rate decline from our record net sale amount presuming sequestration doe not occur the continuing resolution end on march and other factor based on our preliminary understanding of sequestration and noting that it is difficult to estimate how sequestration would be implemented we believe that should congress and the administration fail to change or further delay sequestration our net sale would be lower than net sale by more than the mid single digit outlook noted above future year could be materially impacted however subject to the uncertainty described above we expect that the impact of sequestration on our operating result may lag in certain of our business with longer cycle such our aeronautics and space system business segment and our product business within our mfc and mst business segment due to our production contract backlog being funded with money from the government gfy and prior budget we expect that earnings and cash flow reduction prior to restructuring activity would generally follow pattern similar to the net sale reduction we are unable to reasonably estimate the cost and cash flow impact of any restructuring initiative potentially including but not limited to severance payment made to employee facility closure expense and impairment of asset including goodwill to align our cost structure to lower sale base table of content sequestration likely would result in significant rescheduling or termination activity with our supplier base such activity likely would result in claim from our supplier which may include both the amount established in any settlement agreement the cost of evaluating the supplier settlement proposal and the cost of negotiating settlement agreement we expect that these cost would be recovered from our customer lockheed martin is committed to the fair treatment of it employee and compliance with law accordingly if sequestration or other budget cut intended to avoid sequestration occur we will provide affected employee the notice required by the federal and applicable state worker adjustment and retraining notification warn act when we conclude based on the circumstance and those law that notice is required or otherwise appropriate the office of management and budget and dod have issued guidance intended to assure that the cost of complying with federal and state warn act are recoverable and we expect to recover these cost despite the continuing uncertainty on government budget the investment and acquisition we have made in recent year have sought to align our business with what we believe are the most critical national priority and mission area the possibility remains however that our program could be materially reduced extended or terminated result of the government continuing assessment of priority change in government priority the implementation of sequestration or other budget cut intended to avoid sequestration department of defense business the passage of the budget act imposed specific limit on security and non security spending beginning in gfy the gfy dod base budget is the first to reflect the reduced spending limit imposed by the budget act and is consistent with it limit on discretionary spending the gfy request ha been delayed result of the ongoing federal budgetary negotiation the gfy request will likely reflect continuation of the spending limit with some variation result of sequester negotiation in prior year the administration ha requested and congress ha provided fund for military operation in afghanistan and iraq and other unforeseeable contingency or peacekeeping operation through separate oco funding outside of the base dod budget the oco funding for gfy totaled billion and the administration requested billion for gfy we expect that the fiscal request will continue these reduction reflecting the completion of military operation in iraq and reduced operation in afghanistan our net sale historically have not been significantly dependent on overseas contingency or supplemental funding request and therefore we continue to focus our attention on the dod base budget for support and funding of our program the gfy budget proposal reflected the administration new national security strategy and is consistent with the lower spending level imposed by the budget act we have no specific indication that the gfy budget will deviate significantly other than the reduction due to the sequester delay described above from the estimated spending level in the gfy request despite these reduced defense spending level we believe our broad mix of program and capability continues to position favorably to support the current and future need of the dod and our program were well supported in the gfy budget request for example the budget supported continuation of all three variant of the and maintains the same ultimate inventory objective of aircraft for the government additionally the dod ha specifically cited continued support for broad spectrum of our program given the administration emphasis on affordability and the need to find further efficiency in the management and operation of dod the need for more affordable logistics and sustainment expansive use of information technology and knowledge based solution and vastly improved level of network and cyber security all remain national priority to address these priority we continue to focus on growing our portfolio in these area diversifying our business and expanding into adjacent business and program that include surface naval vessel unmanned aerial system rotary wing aviation and land vehicle non department of defense business our experience in the defense arena together with our core information technology and service expertise ha enabled to provide product and service to number of government agency including the department of homeland security justice commerce health and human service transportation and energy the postal service the social security administration ssa the federal aviation administration the national aeronautics and space administration the veteran administration national science foundation and the environmental protection agency epa table of content with the dod all other department and agency were impacted by the budget act the result would be that budget for gfy and beyond will be reduced further below the gfy budget should sequester go into effect on march our non dod customer will also be significantly affected the across the board reduction will also be applied to their available gfy discretionary fund our business with smaller short term contract that work with our non dod customer could be significantly impacted by the across the board reduction such our is business segment we have continued to expand our capability in critical intelligence knowledge management and government information technology solution for our customer including the ssa and the center for medicare and medicaid service we also provide program management business strategy and consulting complex system development and maintenance complete life cycle software support information assurance and enterprise solution we believe that there will be continued demand by federal and civil government agency for upgrading and investing in new information technology system and solution in order to reduce cost of operation but at slower pace in the near term in addition we believe there are opportunity in the health care and energy space consistent with our dod business more expansive use of information technology and knowledge based solution and improved level of network and cyber security all appear to be priority in our non dod business well homeland security critical infrastructure protection and improved service level for civil government agency also appear to be high customer priority other business consideration international business we remain committed to growth in our sale to international customer we conduct business with other government primarily through our aeronautics mfc and mst business segment our international sale are comprised of fm transaction contracted through the government and direct commercial sale transaction in which we sell directly to the international customer in aeronautics the government and eight other government development partner are working together on the design testing production and sustainment of the lightning ii and israel and japan have selected the their next generation combat aircraft the first international delivery of the were made in with two aircraft delivered to the united kingdom the number of aircraft for international customer in the more recent and future low rate initial production lrip contract continues to increase the fighting falcon ha been selected by customer worldwide including recent order from iraq and oman with follow on buy from country we continue to expand the super hercules air mobility aircraft international footprint with customer in country in global sustainment we are leveraging our value the original equipment manufacturer oem for our major platform such our agreement to upgrade aircraft for taiwan we have also set up new production capability to provide service life extension including new wing and support for the norway canada and taiwan fleet our mfc business segment produce the patriot advanced capability pac missile an advanced defensive missile designed to intercept incoming airborne threat for international customer including japan germany the netherlands taiwan and the united arab emirate uae additionally the uae entered into fm agreement with the government for the first international sale of the terminal high altitude area defense thaad missile defense system with expectation for further production award other country in the middle east well those in the asia pacific region have also expressed interest in our air and missile defense system in mst with regard to the aegis combat system aegis we perform activity in the development production ship integration and test and lifetime support for ship of international customer such japan spain korea and australia the system also ha been selected to be used ground based missile defense system in europe referred to aegis ashore this business segment ha contract with the canadian government for the upgrade and support of combat system on halifax class frigate the littoral combat ship lcs is another program generating interest from potential international customer we are responsible for integrating mission system and sensor including the digital cockpit and weapon for the mh maritime helicopter produced for the royal australian navy and in the danish government signed an official letter of offer and acceptance formalizing it intent to buy nine mh helicopter we continue to upgrade the united kingdom warrior fighting vehicle an award received in table of content status of program the program consists of multiple contract the development contract is being performed concurrently with the lrip contract concurrent performance of development and production contract is used for complex program to test airplane shorten the time to field system and achieve overall cost saving we expect the development portion of the program will be substantially complete in with le significant effort to continue into production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many year given the government current inventory objective of aircraft for the air force marine and navy variant of the aircraft commitment from our eight international partner and two international customer well expression of interest from other country on the development contract our flight test and test point were ahead of our goal for the year and the aircraft also surpassed flight hour the development contract currently ha million of incentive fee remaining however we expect to have the opportunity to earn approximately million of this amount over the remainder of the contract this amount includes about million of fee that we expect will be allocated to specific milestone with the remainder allocated to customer assessment of performance at the end of the development contract after updating our estimate at completion on the contract in we reduced the profit booking rate to reflect lower expected estimated fee at completion the inception to date impact of the revised booking rate reduced profit by approximately million during we will continue to record profit at the revised booking rate for the duration of the contract unless further adjustment are necessary we continue to make progress on our production tempo with the delivery of aircraft to our domestic and international customer during the year bringing the cumulative delivery total to which includes development aircraft and production aircraft we also made significant contractual progress recently with the completion of negotiation on the lrip aircraft contract award of an undefinitized contract for certain lrip aircraft and received long lead funding for lrip aircraft we have production aircraft in backlog of december given the size and complexity of the program we anticipate that there will be continual review related to aircraft performance program schedule cost and requirement part of the dod congressional and international partner oversight and budgeting process current program challenge include but are not limited to supplier and partner performance software development receiving funding for lrip contract on timely basis contractual withholds executing future flight test and finding resulting from testing portfolio shaping activity we continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of product and service to meet the current and future need of our customer we accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activity and through acquisition divestiture and internal realignment activity internal realignments are designed to more fully leverage existing capability and enhance development and delivery of product and service we selectively pursue the acquisition of business and investment at attractive valuation that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customer or technology we have made number of niche acquisition of business and investment in affiliate during the past several year we also may explore the divestiture of business in pursuing our business strategy we routinely conduct discussion evaluate target and enter into agreement regarding possible acquisition divestiture joint venture and equity investment we used million and million for the acquisition of business in and in we acquired chandler may inc chandler may and cdl system ltd cdl in the fourth quarter and procerus technology procerus in the first

flight simulator for wide range of airline customer and independent pilot training center worldwide and ha been included in our mst business segment these company complement our core capability and align with our strategy to expand into closely related market and expand our customer base table of content in pursuing our business strategy we have also divested certain business over the past three year recent divestiture consisted of savi technology inc savi in pacific architect and engineer inc pae in and enterprise integration group eig in for additional information see note acquisition and divestiture of our consolidated financial statement consolidated result of operation since our operating cycle is long term and involves many type of contract for the design development and

million net of state tax benefit of which million related to our aeronautics business segment and million related to the reorganization of our former electronic system business segment note these charge reduced our net earnings by million per share and consisted of severance cost associated with the elimination of certain position through either voluntary or involuntary action the severance

system business segment and our is business segment and corporate headquarters these charge reduced our net earnings by million per share and consisted of severance cost associated with the elimination of certain position through either voluntary or involuntary action these severance action resulted from strategic review of these business and our corporate headquarters to better align our organization and cost structure with changing economic condition the workforce reduction at the business segment also reflect change in program lifecycles where several of our major program are either transitioning out of development and into production or are ending during we recorded charge of million net of state tax benefit related to the voluntary executive separation program vesp the

earnings by million per share the majority of the charge wa associated with the accrual of severance payment to employee with the remainder associated with impairment of asset we expect to recover substantial amount of these severance charge including the charge related to the vesp in future period through the pricing of our product and service to the government and other customer while the vesp is expected to be recovered over several year the other severance charge are typically expected to be recovered within one year period after the charge ha been incurred with the impact included

unfunded backlog firm order for which funding ha not yet been appropriated backlog doe not include unexercised option or task order to be issued under indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract funded backlog wa approximately billion at december management evaluates performance on our contract by focusing on net sale and operating profit and not by type or amount of operating expense consequently our discussion of business segment performance focus on net sale and operating profit consistent with our approach for managing the business this approach is consistent with the overall life cycle of our contract management ass the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sale and operating profit and monitor performance on our contract in similar manner through their completion table of content we regularly provide customer with report of our cost the contract progress the cost information in the report is accumulated in manner specified by the requirement of each contract for example cost data provided to our customer for product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product such wing box on an aircraft or for service the type of work being performed such help desk support our contract generally are cost based which allows for the recovery of cost in the pricing of our product and service most of our contract are bid and negotiated with our customer under circumstance in which we are required to disclose our estimated cost to provide the product or service this approach for negotiating contract with our government customer generally allows for the recovery of our cost we also may enter into long term supply contract for certain material or component to coincide with the production schedule of certain product and to ensure their availability at known unit price many of our contract span several year and include highly complex technical requirement at the outset of contract we identify and monitor risk to the achievement of the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract and ass the effect of those risk on our estimate of total cost to complete the contract the estimate consider the technical requirement for example newly developed product versus mature product the schedule and associated task for example the number and type of milestone event and cost for example material labor subcontractor and overhead the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risk surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirement schedule and cost in the initial estimated cost at completion profit booking rate may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risk surrounding the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract conversely our profit booking rate may decrease if the estimated cost to complete the contract increase all of the estimate are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate we have number of program that are designated classified by the government which can not be specifically described the operating result of these classified program are included in our consolidated and business segment result and are subjected to the same oversight and internal control our other program our net sale are primarily derived from long term contract for product and service provided to the government well fm contracted through the government we account for these contract well product contract with non government customer using the poc method of accounting which represent substantially all of our net sale we derive our remaining net sale from contract to provide service to non government customer which we account for under the service method of accounting under the poc method of accounting we record sale on contract based upon our progress towards completion on particular contract well our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion cost reimbursable contract provide for the payment of allowable cost plus fee for fixed priced contract net sale and cost of sale are recognized product are delivered or cost are incurred due to the nature of the poc method of accounting change in our cost of sale are typically accompanied by related change in our net sale in the discussion of comparative segment result change in net sale and operating profit generally are expressed in term of volume change in volume refer to increase or decrease in sale resulting from varying production activity level delivery or service level on individual contract volume change typically include corresponding change in segment operating profit based on the current profit booking rate for particular contract in addition comparability of our segment operating profit may be impacted by change in estimated profit booking rate on our contract accounted for using the poc method of accounting increase in the estimated profit booking rate typically referred to risk retirement usually relate to revision in the total estimated cost at completion that reflect improved condition on particular contract conversely condition on particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated cost at completion and reduction of the estimated profit booking rate increase or decrease in estimated profit booking rate are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception to date effect of such change segment operating profit may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other matter such the resolution of contractual matter reserve for dispute asset impairment and insurance recovery among others segment operating profit and item such risk retirement reduction of profit booking rate or other matter are presented net of state income tax our consolidated net adjustment not related to volume including net profit rate adjustment and other matter increased segment operating profit net of state income tax by approximately billion billion and billion for and

partially offset by lower order on the orion program backlog decreased in compared to mainly due to higher sale volume associated with the orion program and on government satellite activity trend we expect space system net sale to decline in in the mid single digit percentage range compared to due primarily to the absence of any commercial satellite delivery in operating profit is expected to decline in the low double digit percentage range in primarily due to lower equity earnings from usa no further significant activity is expected due to it wind down in and lower sale volume resulting in decline in operating margin between the year liquidity and cash flow we have balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position to take advantage of new business opportunity when they arise consistent with that strategy we have invested in our business including capital expenditure and independent research and development returned cash to stockholder through dividend and share repurchase made selective acquisition of business and managed our debt level we have generated strong operating cash flow which have been the primary source of funding for our operation debt service and repayment capital expenditure share repurchase dividend acquisition and postretirement benefit plan funding we have accessed the capital market on limited occasion needed or when opportunistic we expect our cash from operation will continue to be sufficient to support our operation and anticipated capital expenditure for the table of content foreseeable future we have financing resource available to fund potential cash outflow that are le predictable or more discretionary discussed in the capital structure resource and other section we have access to the credit market if needed for liquidity or general corporate purpose including letter of credit to support customer advance payment and for other trade finance purpose such guaranteeing our performance on particular contract cash received from customer either from the payment of invoice for work performed or for advance in excess of cost incurred is our primary source of cash we generally do not begin work on contract until funding is appropriated by the customer billing timetable and payment term on our contract vary based on number of factor including the contract type we generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost reimbursable and time and material contract which together represent approximately half of the sale we recorded in we are authorized to bill the cost are incurred or work is performed by way of contrast we generally do not bill our fixed price contract until milestone including delivery are achieved number of our fixed price contract may provide for performance based payment which allow to bill and collect cash we perform on the contract the amount of performance based payment and the related milestone are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract such payment may precede our incurrence of cost related to our contract performance thereby increasing our cash flow the government ha indicated that it would consider progress payment the baseline for negotiating payment term on fixed price contract rather than performance based payment in contrast to negotiated performance based payment term progress payment provision correspond to percentage of the amount of cost incurred during the performance of the contract while the total amount of cash collected on contract is the same performance based payment have had more favorable impact on the timing of our cash flow in addition our cash flow may be affected if the government decides to withhold payment on receivables the amount of withholds increased to approximately million of december primarily at our aeronautics business segment related to government audit of our business system and certain delivered aircraft while the impact of withholding delay the receipt of cash the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract will not vary the majority of our capital expenditure for and those planned for can be divided into the category of facility infrastructure equipment and information technology expenditure for facility infrastructure and equipment are generally incurred to support new and existing program across all of our business segment for example we have project underway in our aeronautics business segment for facility and equipment to support production of the combat aircraft in addition we have project underway to modernize certain of our facility inclusive of our effort to consolidate and reduce leased facility we also incur capital expenditure for information technology to support program and general enterprise

of the key element operating activity net earnings non cash adjustment change in working capital other net net cash provided by operating activity net cash used for investing activity net cash used for financing activity cash and cash equivalent at end of year operating activity compared to net cash provided by operating activity decreased billion in compared to primarily due to change in working capital of billion and increased pension contribution of billion net of ca recovery the decrease of billion in cash provided by working capital defined account receivable and inventory le account payable and customer advance and amount in excess of cost incurred wa driven by higher payment of account payable due to timing well the timing of production and billing cycle affecting customer advance and progress payment applied to table of content inventory additionally growth in account receivable primarily due to the timing of finalizing contract negotiation on the lrip contract in the fourth quarter of which delayed our billing well the impact of government withholding on the program reduced the cash provided by operating activity compared to net cash provided by operating activity increased by million in compared to primarily due to change in working capital cash provided by working capital increased by million due to increase in account payable resulting from the timing of payment and an increase in customer advance due to the timing of production and billing schedule this improvement in cash from working capital partially wa offset by an increase in

for share repurchase during and pursuant to our share repurchase program we are authorized to repurchase up to billion of our common stock under the program we have discretion to determine the dollar amount of share to be repurchased and the timing of any repurchase in compliance with applicable law and regulation of december we had repurchased total of million share of our common stock under the program for billion and there remained billion authorized for additional share repurchase cash received from the issuance of our common stock in connection with stock option exercise during and totaled million million and million those activity resulted in the issuance of million share million share and million share during the respective period long term debt in we paid million to complete an exchange of debt note to take advantage of the low interest rate environment in we issued total of billion of long term note with fixed coupon rate ranging from to we used portion of the proceeds from the long term note that were issued in to redeem all of our million long term note due in with fixed coupon rate of in we also repurchased million of our long term note through open market purchase and paid premium of million in connection with the early extinguishments of certain long term note capital structure resource and other at december we held cash and cash equivalent of billion of december approximately million of our cash and cash equivalent wa held outside of the by foreign subsidiary although those balance are generally available to fund ordinary business operation without legal or other restriction significant portion is not immediately available to fund operation unless repatriated our intention is to permanently reinvest earnings from our foreign subsidiary while we do not intend to do so if this cash wa repatriated at the end of we estimate that about million of federal income tax would have been due after considering foreign tax credit table of content our long term debt net of unamortized discount amounted to billion and mainly is in the form of publicly issued note that bear interest at fixed rate of december we were in compliance with all covenant contained in our debt and credit agreement in august we entered into billion revolving credit facility with group of bank and terminated our existing billion revolving credit facility that wa to expire in june the credit facility expires august and we may request and the bank may grant at their discretion an increase to the credit facility by an additional amount up to million there were no borrowing outstanding under either facility through december borrowing under the credit facility would be unsecured and bear interest at rate based at our option on eurodollar rate or base rate defined in the credit facility each bank obligation to make loan under the credit facility is subject to among other thing our compliance with various representation warranty and covenant including covenant limiting our ability and certain of our subsidiary ability to encumber asset and covenant not to exceed maximum leverage ratio defined in the credit facility the leverage ratio covenant excludes the adjustment recognized in stockholder equity related to postretirement benefit plan of december we were in compliance with all covenant contained in the credit facility well in our debt agreement we have agreement in place with banking institution to provide for the issuance of commercial paper there were no commercial paper borrowing outstanding during the year ended december if we were to issue commercial paper the borrowing would be supported by the credit facility we also have an effective shelf registration statement on form on file with the security and exchange commission through august to provide for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt security we actively seek to finance our business in manner that preserve financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing cost to the extent practicable we review change in financial market and economic condition to manage the type amount and maturity of our indebtedness we may at time refinance existing indebtedness vary our mix of variable rate and fixed rate debt or seek alternative financing source for our cash and operational need our stockholder equity wa million at december decrease of million from december the decrease wa due to the annual december measurement adjustment related to our postretirement benefit plan of billion which wa partially offset by the amortization of net actuarial gain and loss of million in dividend declared of billion during the year and the repurchase of million common share for billion these decrease partially were offset by net earnings of billion and employee stock activity of million we repurchase our common share we reduce common stock for the of par value of the share repurchased with the excess purchase price over par value recorded reduction of additional paid in capital due to the volume of repurchase made under our share repurchase program additional paid in capital wa reduced to zero with the remainder of the excess of purchase price over par value of million recorded reduction of retained earnings if in the future we were to have deficit in stockholder equity result of further adjustment associated with the funded status of postretirement benefit plan the deficit would not affect our ability to comply with our debt covenant the debt related financial covenant in our revolving credit facility exclude the effect of adjustment to stockholder equity resulting from re measuring the funded status of postretirement plan in addition maryland corporation so long we are able to pay our indebtedness it becomes due in the usual course of business we anticipate that we would be able to pay dividend and make stock repurchase in an amount limited to our net earnings in either the current or the preceding fiscal year or from the net earnings for the preceding eight quarter table of content contractual commitment and off balance sheet arrangement at december we had contractual commitment to repay debt make payment under operating lease settle obligation related to agreement to purchase good and service and settle tax and other liability capital lease obligation were not material payment due under these obligation and commitment are follows in million payment due by period total le than year year and year and after year long term debt interest payment other liability operating lease obligation purchase obligation operating activity capital expenditure total contractual cash obligation long term debt includes scheduled principal payment only amount related to other liability represent the contractual obligation for certain long term liability recorded of december such amount mainly include expected payment under non qualified pension plan environmental liability and deferred compensation plan purchase obligation related to operating activity include agreement and contract that give the supplier recourse to for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain term that would subject to liquidated damage such agreement and contract may for example be related to direct material obligation to subcontractor and outsourcing arrangement total purchase obligation for operating activity in the preceding table include approximately billion related to contractual commitment entered into result of contract we have with our government customer the government generally would be required to pay for any cost we incur relative to these commitment if they were to terminate the related contract for convenience under the far subject to available funding this also would be true in case where we perform subcontract work for prime contractor under government contract the termination for convenience language also may be included in contract with foreign state and local government we also have contract with customer that do not include termination for convenience provision including contract with commercial customer purchase obligation in the preceding table for capital expenditure generally include amount for facility and equipment related to customer contract we also may enter into industrial cooperation agreement sometimes referred to offset agreement condition to obtaining order for our product and service from certain customer in foreign country these agreement are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country offset agreement may be satisfied through activity that do not require to use cash including transferring technology providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in country project and the purchase by third party our vendor of supply from in country vendor these agreement also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activity purchasing supply from in country vendor providing financial support for in country project establishment of joint venture with local company and building or leasing facility for in country operation we typically do not commit to offset agreement until order for our product or service are definitive the amount ultimately applied against our offset agreement are based on negotiation with the customer and typically require cash outlay that represent only fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement at december the remaining obligation under our outstanding offset agreement totaled billion which primarily relate to our aeronautics mfc and mst business segment some of which extend through to the extent we have entered into purchase obligation at december that also satisfy offset agreement those amount are included in the preceding table offset program usually extend over several year and may provide for penalty in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirement while historically we have not been required to pay material penalty resolution of offset requirement are often the result of negotiation and subjective judgment in connection with our ownership interest of ula we and the boeing company boeing have each received distribution totaling million since ula formation in december which are subject to agreement between boeing and ula whereby if ula doe not have sufficient cash resource or credit capacity to make payment under the table of content inventory supply agreement it ha with boeing both we and boeing would provide to ula in the form of an additional capital contribution the level of funding required for ula to make those payment any such capital contribution would not exceed the amount of the distribution subject to the agreement we currently believe that ula will have sufficient operating cash flow and credit capacity including access to it million revolving credit agreement from third party financial institution to meet it obligation such that we would not be required to make contribution under these agreement in addition both we and boeing have cross indemnified each other for guarantee by and boeing of the performance and financial obligation of ula under certain launch service contract we believe ula will be able to fully perform it obligation it ha done through december and that it will not be necessary to make payment under the cross indemnity or guarantee we have entered into standby letter of credit surety bond and third party guarantee with financial institution and other third party primarily relating to advance received from customer and the guarantee of future performance on certain contract letter of credit and surety bond generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform in some case we may guarantee the contractual performance of third party such joint venture partner at december we had the following outstanding letter of credit surety bond and guarantee in million commitment expiration by period totalcommitment le than year year and year and after year standby letter of credit surety bond guarantee total commitment approximately million million and million of standby letter of credit in the le than year year and and year and period and approximately million of surety bond are expected to renew for additional period until completion of the contractual obligation at december third party guarantee totaled million of which approximately related to guarantee of the contractual performance of joint venture to which we currently are or previously were party this amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non performance of the joint venture partner in addition we generally have cross indemnity in place that may enable to recover amount that may be paid on behalf of joint venture partner we believe our current and former joint venture partner will be able to perform their obligation they have done through december and that it will not be necessary to make payment under the guarantee in determining our exposure we evaluate the reputation technical capability and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partner critical accounting policy contract accounting sale recognition substantially all of our net sale are accounted for using the poc method which requires that significant estimate and assumption be made in accounting for the contract our remaining net sale are derived from contract to provide service to non government customer which we account for under the service accounting model we evaluate new or significantly modified contract with customer other than the government to the extent the contract include multiple element to determine if the individual deliverable should be accounted for separate unit of accounting when we determine that accounting for the deliverable separate unit is appropriate we allocate the contract value to the deliverable based on their relative estimated selling price the contract or contract modification we evaluate for multiple element typically are long term in nature and include the provision of both product and service based on the nature of our business we generally account for component of such contract using the poc accounting model or the service accounting model appropriate we classify net sale product or service on our statement of earnings based on the predominant attribute of the underlying contract most of our long term contract are denominated in dollar including contract for sale of military product and service to other government conducted through the government we record sale for both product and service under cost reimbursable fixed price and time and material contract table of content contract type cost reimbursable contract cost reimbursable contract which accounted for about and of our total net sale in and provide for the payment of allowable cost incurred during performance of the contract plus fee up to ceiling based on the amount that ha been funded we generate revenue under two general type of cost reimbursable contract cost plus award fee incentive fee which represent substantial majority of our cost reimbursable contract and cost plus fixed fee contract cost plus award fee contract provide for an award fee that varies within specified limit based on the customer assessment of our performance against predetermined set of criterion such target based on cost quality technical and schedule criterion cost plus incentive fee contract provide for reimbursement of cost plus fee which is adjusted by formula based on the relationship of total allowable cost to total target cost incentive based on cost or reimbursement of cost plus an incentive to exceed stated performance target incentive based on performance the fixed fee in cost plus fixed fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed fee doe not vary with actual cost fixed price and other contract under fixed price contract which accounted for about and of our total net sale in and we agree to perform the specified work for pre determined price to the extent our actual cost vary from the estimate upon which the price wa negotiated we will generate more or le profit or could incur loss some fixed price contract have performance based component under which we may earn incentive payment or incur financial penalty based on our performance under time and material contract which accounted for about of our total net sale in each of and we are paid fixed hourly rate for each direct labor hour expended and we are reimbursed for allowable material cost and allowable out of pocket expense to the extent our actual direct labor and associated cost vary in relation to the fixed hourly billing rate provided in the contract we will generate more or le profit or could incur loss poc method of accounting we record net sale and an estimated profit on poc basis for cost reimbursable and fixed price contract for product and service contract with the government the poc method for product contract depends on the nature of the product provided under the contract for example for contract that require to perform significant level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract and or to deliver minimal quantity sale are recorded using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion under the cost to cost method of accounting we recognize sale and an estimated profit cost are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred cost bear to total estimated cost for contract that require to provide substantial number of similar item without significant level of development we record sale and an estimated profit on poc basis using unit of delivery the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract for contract to provide service to the government sale are generally recorded using the cost to cost method award and incentive fee well penalty related to contract performance are considered in estimating sale and profit rate on contract accounted for under the poc method estimate of award fee are based on past experience and anticipated performance we record incentive or penalty when there is sufficient information to ass anticipated contract performance incentive provision that increase or decrease earnings based solely on single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs accounting for contract under the poc method requires judgment relative to assessing risk estimating contract sale and cost including estimating award and incentive fee and penalty related to performance and making assumption for schedule and technical issue due to the number of year it may take to complete many of our contract and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contract the estimation of total sale and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variable contract cost include material labor and subcontracting cost well an allocation of indirect cost our estimate of cost at completion of the contract are based on assumption we make for variable such labor productivity and table of content availability the complexity of the work to be performed the availability of material the length of time to complete the contract to estimate increase in wage and price for material performance by our subcontractor and the availability and timing of funding from our customer among other variable when estimate of total cost to be incurred on contract exceed total estimate of revenue to be earned provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined many of our contract span several year and include highly complex technical requirement at the outset of contract we identify and monitor risk to the achievement of the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract and ass the effect of those risk on our estimate of total cost to complete the contract the estimate consider the technical requirement for example newly developed product versus mature product the schedule and associated task for example the number and type of milestone event and cost for example material labor subcontractor and overhead the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risk surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirement schedule and cost in the initial estimated cost at completion profit booking rate may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risk surrounding the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract alternatively our profit booking rate may decrease if the estimated cost to complete the contract increase all of the estimate are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate in addition comparability of our segment operating profit may be impacted by change in estimated profit booking rate on our contract accounted for using the poc method of accounting increase in the estimated profit booking rate typically referred to risk retirement usually relate to revision in the total estimated cost at completion that reflect improved condition on particular contract conversely condition on particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the total estimated cost at completion and reduction of the estimated profit booking rate increase or decrease in estimated profit booking rate are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception to date effect of such change segment operating profit may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other matter such the resolution of contractual matter reserve for dispute asset impairment and insurance recovery among others segment operating profit and item such risk retirement reduction of profit booking rate or other matter are presented net of state income tax service method of accounting under fixed price service contract we are paid predetermined fixed amount for specified scope of work and generally have full responsibility for the cost associated with the contract and the resulting profit or loss we record net sale under fixed price service contract to non government customer on straight line basis over the period of contract performance unless evidence suggests that net sale are earned or the obligation are fulfilled in different pattern for cost reimbursable contract for service to non government customer that provide for award and incentive fee we record net sale service are performed exclusive of award and incentive fee award and incentive fee are recorded when they are fixed or determinable generally at the date the amount is communicated to by the customer this approach result in the recognition of such fee at contractual interval typically every six month throughout the contract and is dependent on the customer process for notification of award and issuance of formal notification cost for all service contract are expensed incurred other contract accounting consideration the majority of our sale are driven by pricing based on cost incurred to produce product or perform service under contract with the government cost based pricing is determined under the far the far provides guidance on the type of cost that are allowable in establishing price for good and service under government contract for example cost such those related to charitable contribution interest expense and certain advertising and public relation activity are unallowable and therefore not recoverable through sale in addition we may enter into advance agreement with the government that address the subject of allowability and allocability of cost to contract for specific matter for example most of the environmental cost we incur for environmental remediation related to site operated in prior year are allocated to our current operation general and administrative cost under far provision and supporting advance agreement reached with the government we closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policy related to contract accounting cost incurred and allocated to contract are reviewed for compliance with government regulation by our personnel and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency table of content postretirement benefit plan overview many of our employee are covered by defined benefit pension plan and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefit to eligible retiree collectively postretirement benefit plan see note in recent year we have taken certain action to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plan on our financial result including no longer offering defined benefit pension plan to new non represented employee starting in january over the last few year we have negotiated similar change with our union represented population and result substantially all represented employee hired after june do not participate in defined benefit pension plan we have also made substantial cash contribution over the year to our defined benefit pension plan including billion in additionally during lump settlement payment of million were made from the defined benefit pension trust to certain former employee who had not commenced receiving their vested benefit payment and the corresponding benefit obligation that wa released wa million notwithstanding these action the impact of these plan and benefit on our gaap earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and funded status for our postretirement benefit plan may materially change from year to year because those calculation are sensitive to funding level well change in several key economic assumption including interest rate rate of return on plan asset and other actuarial assumption including expected rate of increase in future compensation level employee turnover and mortality well the timing of funding we recognize on plan by plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plan under gaap either an asset or liability on our balance sheet there is corresponding non cash adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax benefit recorded deferred tax asset in stockholder equity the gaap funded status is measured the difference between the fair value of the plan asset and the benefit obligation of the plan the gaap benefit obligation represents the present value of the future benefit to be paid to plan participant the present value is calculated using discount rate that is determined at the end of each year historically low interest rate over the last few year have significantly increased our benefit obligation this ha contributed to lower funded status of our defined benefit pension plan determined by gaap the funding of our pension plan is determined in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of erisa amended by the pension protection act of ppa our goal ha been to fund the pension plan to level of at least determined by the ppa this erisa funded status is calculated on different basis than under gaap the erisa liability doe not reflect anticipated future pay increase for plan participant required under gaap and is currently measured using higher discount rate than for gaap primarily due to the moving ahead for progress in the century act of map which provides temporary funding relief due to the historically low interest rate environment by way of contrast under erisa our plan are about funded at december and while for gaap our defined benefit pension plan are about funded at december and the government cost accounting standard ca governs the extent to which our pension cost are allocable to and recoverable under contract with the government including fm actuarial assumption gaap requires that the amount we record related to our plan be computed using actuarial valuation the primary year end assumption used to determine the funded status and estimate postretirement benefit plan expense for the following calendar year are the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan asset and employee turnover and mortality for all postretirement benefit plan funding level the expected rate of increase in future compensation level for the participant in our defined benefit pension plan and the health care cost trend rate for our retiree medical plan these assumption we make impact both the calculation of the benefit obligation at the end of the year and the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in the subsequent year the difference between the long term rate of return on plan asset assumption we select and the actual return on plan asset well funding level in any given year affect both the funded status of our benefit plan and the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in subsequent year when reassessing these assumption each year we consider past and current market condition and make judgment about future market trend we also have to consider factor such the timing and amount of expected contribution to the plan and benefit payment to plan participant we selected the discount rate for calculating our benefit obligation at december related to our defined benefit pension plan compared to at the end of and at the end of we selected the discount rate for calculating our benefit obligation at december related to our retiree medical plan compared to at the end of and at the end of we evaluate several data point in order to arrive at an appropriate table of content discount rate including result from cash flow model quoted rate from long term bond index and change in long term bond rate over the past year part of our evaluation we calculate the approximate average yield on corporate bond rated aa or better that were selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flow we concluded that wa reasonable estimate for the expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumption at december consistent with the rate used at december and we used at december the long term rate of return assumption represents the expected average rate of earnings on the fund invested or to be invested to provide for the benefit included in the plan obligation this assumption is based on several factor including historical market index return the anticipated long term allocation of plan asset the historical return data for the trust fund plan expense and the potential to outperform market index return the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption but the average expected return over long term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption result change in this assumption are le frequent than change in the discount rate our stockholder equity ha been reduced cumulatively by billion from the annual year end measurement of the funded status of postretirement benefit plan inclusive of the december adjustment of billion these non cash after tax amount primarily represent net actuarial loss resulting from decline in discount rate and difference between actual experience and our actuarial assumption which will be amortized to expense over the average future service period of employee expected to receive benefit under the plan of approximately year during million of these amount wa recognized component of postretirement benefit plan expense and billion is expected to be recognized expense in if in the future we were to have deficit in stockholder equity result of further adjustment associated with the funded status of postretirement benefit plan the deficit would not affect our ability to comply with our debt covenant nor do we anticipate the deficit to hinder our ability to pay dividend and make stock repurchase further described in the capital structure resource and other section above we expect that our pension expense will be billion which is comparable to our pension expense an increase in the amortization of net actuarial gain and loss caused by the decrease in the discount rate mentioned above wa offset by an increase in the expected dollar amount of return on plan asset primarily due to the billion of discretionary contribution to the qualified defined benefit plan in the fourth quarter of the discount rate and long term rate of return on plan asset assumption we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimate and judgment change of plus or minus basis point in the discount rate assumption at december with all other assumption held constant would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of by approximately billion which would result in an after tax increase or decrease in stockholder equity at the end of the year of approximately billion if the discount rate at december that wa used to compute the expected expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plan had been basis point higher or lower with all other assumption held constant the amount of expense projected for would be lower or higher by approximately million if the expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumption at december that wa used to compute the expected expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plan had been basis point higher or lower with all other assumption held constant the amount of expense projected for would be lower or higher by approximately million funding consideration the ppa became applicable to and other large defense contractor beginning in and had the effect of accelerating the required amount of annual pension plan contribution we made contribution related to our qualified defined benefit pension plan of billion in billion in and billion in inclusive of amount in excess of our required contribution we recovered billion in million in and million in ca cost amount funded under ca are recovered over time through the pricing of our product and service on government contract including fm and are recognized in our cost of sale and net sale amount contributed in excess of the ca funding requirement over billion inclusive of interest of december are considered to be prepayment credit under the ca rule we would expect our required contribution to be temporarily lowered beginning in through result of map we expect to make contribution of billion related to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in and anticipate recovering billion ca cost on our contract in the ca board published it revised pension accounting rule ca harmonization with an effective date of february to better align the recovery of pension contribution including prepayment credit on government table of content contract with the accelerated funding requirement of the ppa the ca harmonization rule increase our ca cost beginning in there is transition period during which the cost impact of the new rule is phased in with the full impact occurring in the incremental impact of ca harmonization in is modest ca cost increase and we expect much larger increase will occur successively in year through based upon current assumption which may change we expect that the increase in ca cost caused by ca harmonization should result in increased earnings few year from now our ca cost would be in excess of the pension expense we record under gaap accordingly we expect our non cash fa ca pension adjustment discussed further in the business segment result of operation section above will soon increase earnings rather than decrease earnings it ha the past few year in addition we expect that our future ca pension recovery will soon be equal to or greater than our required pension contribution which should increase our cash flow from operation environmental matter we are party to various agreement proceeding and potential proceeding for environmental cleanup issue including matter at various site where we have been designated potentially responsible party prp by the epa or by state agency at december and the total amount of liability recorded on our balance sheet for environmental matter wa million and million we have recorded receivables totaling million and million at december and for the portion of environmental cost that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our product and service for agency of the government discussed below the amount that is expected to be allocated to our non government contract or that is determined to be unallowable for pricing under government contract ha been expensed through cost of sale we project cost and recovery of cost over approximately year we enter into agreement administrative order consent decree that document the extent and timing of our environmental remediation obligation we also are involved in remediation activity at environmental site where formal agreement either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation environmental cleanup activity usually span many year which make estimating the cost more judgmental due to for example changing remediation technology to determine the cost related to cleanup site we have to ass the extent of contamination effect on natural resource the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation and evolving regulatory environmental standard we perform quarterly review of environmental remediation site and record liability and receivables in the period it becomes probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated see the discussion under environmental matter in note significant accounting policy and note legal proceeding commitment and contingency to our consolidated financial statement we consider the above factor in our quarterly estimate of the timing and amount of any future cost that may be required for remediation activity which result in the calculation of range of estimate for particular environmental site we do not discount the recorded liability the amount and timing of future cash payment are not fixed or can not be reliably determined given the required level of judgment and estimation it is likely that materially different amount could be recorded if different assumption were used or if circumstance were to change change in environmental standard or change in our estimate of the extent of contamination both the epa and the california office of environmental health hazard assessment announced plan in january to regulate two chemical perchlorate and hexavalent chromium to level in drinking water that are expected to be substantially lower than the existing public health goal or standard established in california the rulemaking process are lengthy and may take year to complete if substantially lower standard are adopted we would expect material increase in our estimate for remediation at several existing site under agreement reached with the government most of the amount we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operation general and administrative cost under existing government regulation these and other environmental expenditure relating to our government business after deducting any recovery received from insurance or other prps are allowable in establishing price of our product and service result most of the expenditure we incur are included in our net sale and cost of sale according to government agreement or regulation regardless of the contract form cost reimbursable fixed price we continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing among other factor government regulation our government business base and contract mix and our history of receiving reimbursement of such cost disclosed above we may record change in the amount of environmental remediation liability result of our quarterly review of the status of our environmental remediation site which would result in change to the corresponding table of content environmental receivable and charge to earnings for example if we were to determine that the liability should be increased by million the corresponding receivables would be increased by approximately million with the remainder recorded charge to earnings this allocation is determined annually based upon our existing and projected business activity with the government we reasonably can not determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental site with which we are involved there are number of former operating facility we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation in some case although loss may be probable it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activity because of uncertainty assessing the extent of the contamination during any particular quarter such uncertainty may be resolved allowing to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate particular former operating site the amount of the liability could be material upon recognition of the liability portion will be recognized receivable with the remainder charged to earnings if we are ultimately found to have liability at those site where we have been designated prp we expect that the actual cost of remediation will be shared with other liable prps generally prps that are ultimately determined to be responsible party are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among to share on an allocated basis the cost and expense for investigation and remediation under existing environmental law responsible party are jointly and severally liable and therefore we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation in the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation the statutory framework provides that we may pursue right of cost recovery or contribution from the other prps the amount we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental cost we have incurred through insurance or from other prps which we are required to pursue by agreement and government regulation goodwill our goodwill balance were billion and billion at december and we test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain event or significant change in circumstance that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable such event or change in circumstance may include significant deterioration in overall economic condition change in the business climate of our industry decline in our market capitalization operating performance indicator competition reorganization of our business or the disposal of all or portion of reporting unit our goodwill ha been allocated to and is tested for impairment at level referred to the reporting unit which is our business segment level or level below the business segment the level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires judgment to determine whether the operation below the business segment constitute self sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly review the operating result we initially test goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with it carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired if the carrying value of reporting unit exceeds it fair value we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of it goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the carrying value of each reporting unit includes the asset and liability employed in it operation allocation of amount held at the business segment and corporate level well goodwill the corporate allocation include our postretirement benefit plan liability determined in accordance with ca in order to align the basis of the carrying value with the fair value of our reporting unit ca expense is recovered through the pricing of our product and service on government contract and therefore is allocated to and recognized in the estimated fair value of each reporting unit the discount rate used for ca is currently higher than the discount rate used for gaap but is expected to trend downward over the next few year and would increase the amount of ca liability allocated to each reporting unit contributing to decline in the carrying value of each reporting unit we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using combination of discounted cash flow dcf analysis and market based valuation methodology such comparable public trading value and value observed in market transaction determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgment about the amount and timing of expected future cash flow discount rate perpetual growth rate and relevant comparable company earnings multiple and transaction multiple the cash flow employed in the dcf analysis are based on our best estimate of future sale and operating cost based primarily on existing firm order expected future order contract with supplier labor agreement and general market condition change in working capital long term business plan and recent operating performance the table of content discount rate utilized in the dcf analysis are based on our weighted average cost of capital wacc which take into account the relative weight of each component of capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flow of the respective reporting unit in the fourth quarter of we tested goodwill for impairment for each of our reporting unit including the reporting unit of our former electronic system business segment and the reporting unit of our new mfc and mst business segment the result of our annual impairment test of goodwill indicated that the estimated fair value of our reporting unit exceeded their carrying value and such no impairment existed the fair value of each reporting unit wa premised on the assumption that sequestration doe not occur it remains difficult to determine when and how sequestration would be implemented that the government continues to support and fund our program which is consistent with the continuing resolution funding measure through march and that congress approves defense budget legislation for the government fiscal year at level consistent with the president proposed defense budget for the second half of the government fiscal year while the specific effect of sequestration can not be determined we expect that across the board reduction would cause our sale profit and cash flow to be lower than our current projection such circumstance could eventually result in an impairment of our goodwill certain of our business with smaller short term contract are the most susceptible to the impact of budget reduction such our is business segment and certain service business within our mfc and mst business segment however we currently do not believe that any of our reporting unit are at risk of failing goodwill impairment test in the near term their fair value are significantly greater than their carrying value impairment assessment inherently involve management judgment regarding assumption about expected future sale profit and cash flow and the impact of market condition on those assumption due to the many variable inherent in the estimation of reporting unit fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill difference in assumption may have material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting unit and could result in goodwill impairment charge in future period income tax we calculate our provision for income tax using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax asset and liability are recognized based on the future tax consequence attributable to temporary difference that exist between the financial statement carrying value of asset and liability and their respective tax base well from operating loss and tax credit carry forward we measure deferred tax asset and liability using enacted tax rate that will apply in the year in which we expect the temporary difference to be recovered or paid future change in tax law could significantly impact the provision for income tax the amount of tax payable and the deferred tax asset and liability balance recent proposal to lower the corporate income tax rate would require to reduce our net deferred tax asset upon enactment of the related tax legislation with corresponding material one time increase to income tax expense but our income tax expense and payment would be materially reduced in subsequent year our net deferred tax asset of december and were billion and billion based on federal statutory income tax rate and primarily relate to our postretirement benefit plan if the federal statutory income tax rate had been lowered to at december our net deferred tax asset would have been reduced by billion and we would have recorded corresponding one time increase in income tax expense of billion the amount of net deferred tax asset will change periodically based on several factor including the annual re measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligation and actual cash contribution to our postretirement benefit plan recent accounting pronouncement we adopted new accounting standard during which resulted only in change in how we present other comprehensive loss in our consolidated financial statement and did not have any impact on our result of operation financial position or cash flow for more information see the recent accounting pronouncement section within note significant accounting policy of our consolidated financial statement table of content item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we maintain active relationship with broad

to closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse development with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of and access to sufficient credit resource our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and market price on certain equity security our financial instrument that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed rate long term debt bond yield are at historical low and move inversely to bond price the estimated fair value of our outstanding debt wa billion at december and the outstanding principal amount wa billion excluding unamortized discount of million change in the level of interest rate would not have material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at december we use derivative instrument principally to reduce our exposure to market risk from change in foreign exchange rate and interest rate we do not enter into or hold derivative instrument for speculative trading purpose we transact business globally and are subject to risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rate we enter into foreign currency hedge such forward and option contract that change in value foreign currency exchange rate change our most significant foreign currency exposure relate to the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar these contract hedge forecasted foreign currency transaction in order to mitigate fluctuation in our earnings and cash flow associated with change in foreign currency exchange rate we designate foreign currency hedge cash flow hedge we also are exposed to the impact of interest rate change primarily through our borrowing activity for fixed rate borrowing we may use variable interest rate swap effectively converting fixed rate borrowing to variable rate borrowing indexed to libor in order to reduce the amount of interest paid these swap are designated fair value hedge for variable rate borrowing we may use fixed interest rate swap effectively converting variable rate borrowing to fixed rate borrowing in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate change on earnings these swap are designated cash flow hedge we may also enter into derivative instrument that are not designated hedge and do not qualify for hedge accounting which are intended to mitigate economic exposure the classification of gain and loss resulting from change in the fair value of derivative is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and it resulting designation adjustment to reflect change in fair value of derivative attributable to the effective portion of hedge are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustment to the hedged item or reflected net of income tax in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings change in the fair value of the derivative that are attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedge or of derivative that are not considered to be highly effective hedge if any are immediately recognized in earnings the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency exchange contract at december and wa billion and billion the aggregate notional amount of our interest rate swap contract at december and wa million and million at december and the net fair value of our derivative instrument wa not material note appreciation or devaluation of the hedged currency compared to the level of foreign exchange rate for currency under contract at december would not have material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contract or our cash flow we evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transaction and only enter into agreement with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreement are executed our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several bank we periodically monitor change to counterparty credit quality well our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties we do not hold or issue derivative financial instrument for trading or speculative purpose we maintain separate trust that includes investment to fund certain of our non qualified deferred compensation plan of december investment in the trust totaled million and are reflected at fair value on our balance sheet in other noncurrent asset the trust hold investment in marketable equity security and fixed income security that are exposed to price change and change in interest rate portion of the liability associated with the deferred compensation plan supported by the trust is also impacted by change in the market price of our common stock and certain market index change in the value of

is recorded on construction in progress until such asset are placed into operation depreciation expense related to plant and equipment wa million in million in and million in we review the carrying value of long lived asset for impairment if event or change in the fact and circumstance indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable we ass impairment by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flow of the related asset to it carrying value if an asset is determined to be impaired we recognize an impairment charge in the current period for the difference between the fair value of the asset and it carrying value table of content capitalized software we capitalize certain cost associated with the development or purchase of internal use software the amount capitalized are included in other noncurrent asset on our balance sheet and are amortized on straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the resulting software which range from two to six year of december and capitalized software totaled million and million net of accumulated amortization of billion and billion no amortization expense is recorded until the software is ready for it intended use amortization expense related to capitalized software wa million in million in and million in goodwill we test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain event or significant change in circumstance that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable such event or change in circumstance may include significant deterioration in overall economic condition change in the business climate of our industry decline in our market capitalization operating performance indicator competition reorganization of our business or the disposal of all or portion of reporting unit our goodwill ha been allocated to and is tested for impairment at level referred to the reporting unit which is our business segment level or level below the business segment we initially test goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with it carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired if the carrying value of reporting unit exceeds it fair value we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of it goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market based valuation methodology such comparable public trading value and value observed in market transaction we completed our assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year presented and did not identify any impairment customer advance and amount in excess of cost incurred we receive advance performance based payment and progress payment from customer that may exceed cost incurred on certain contract including contract with agency of the government we classify such advance other than those reflected reduction of receivables or inventory discussed above current liability postretirement benefit plan many of our employee are covered by defined benefit pension plan and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefit to eligible retiree collectively postretirement benefit plan gaap requires that the amount we record related to our postretirement benefit plan be computed using actuarial valuation that are based in part on certain key assumption we make including the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan asset the rate of increase in future compensation level health care cost trend rate and employee turnover and mortality each appropriate based on the nature of the plan we recognize on plan by plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plan under gaap either an asset recorded within other noncurrent asset or liability recorded within noncurrent liability on our balance sheet there is corresponding non cash adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax benefit recorded deferred tax asset in stockholder equity the gaap funded status is measured the difference between the fair value of the plan asset and the benefit obligation of the plan the funded status under the employee retirement income security act of erisa amended by the pension protection act of ppa is calculated on different basis than under gaap environmental matter we record liability for environmental matter when it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the cost to be incurred for remediation at particular site we do not discount the recorded liability the amount and timing of future cash payment are not fixed or can not be reliably determined our environmental liability are recorded on our balance sheet within other liability both current and non current we expect to include substantial portion of environmental cost in net sale and cost of sale in future period pursuant to government agreement or regulation at the time liability is recorded for future environmental cost we record receivable for estimated future recovery considered probable through the pricing of product and service to agency of the government regardless of the contract form cost reimbursable fixed price we continuously evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing among other factor government regulation our government business base and contract mix and our history of receiving reimbursement of such cost we include the portion of those cost expected to be allocated to our non government contract or that is determined to be unallowable for pricing under government contract in cost of sale at the time the liability is established our environmental receivables are recorded on our balance sheet within other asset both current and non current we project cost and recovery of cost over approximately year table of content sale and earnings we record net sale and estimated profit for substantially all of our contract using the poc method for cost reimbursable and fixed price contract for product and service with the government sale are recorded on all time and material contract the work is performed based on agreed upon hourly rate and allowable cost we account for our service contract with non government customer using the service method of accounting we classify net sale product or service on our statement of earnings based on the attribute of the underlying contract poc method of accounting the poc method for product contract depends on the nature of the product provided under the contract for example for contract that require to perform significant level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract and or to deliver minimal quantity sale are recorded using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion under the cost to cost method of accounting we recognize sale and an estimated profit cost are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred cost bear to total estimated cost for contract that require to provide substantial number of similar item without significant level of development we record sale and an estimated profit on poc basis using unit of delivery the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract for contract to provide service to the government sale are generally recorded using the cost to cost method award and incentive fee well penalty related to contract performance are considered in estimating sale and profit rate on contract accounted for under the poc method estimate of award fee are based on past experience and anticipated performance we record incentive or penalty when there is sufficient information to ass anticipated contract performance incentive provision that increase or decrease earnings based solely on single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs accounting for contract using the poc method requires judgment relative to assessing risk estimating contract sale and cost including estimating award and incentive fee and penalty related to performance and making assumption for schedule and technical issue due to the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contract the estimation of total sale and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variable and accordingly is subject to change when adjustment in estimated contract sale or estimated cost at completion are required any change from prior estimate are recognized in the current period for the inception to date effect of such change when estimate of total cost to be incurred on contract exceed total estimate of sale to be earned provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined many of our contract span several year and include highly complex technical requirement at the outset of contract we identify and monitor risk to the achievement of the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract and ass the effect of those risk on our estimate of total cost to complete the contract the estimate consider the technical requirement for example newly developed product versus mature product the schedule and associated task for example the number and type of milestone event and cost for example material labor subcontractor and overhead the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risk surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirement schedule and cost in the initial estimated cost at completion profit booking rate may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risk surrounding the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract alternatively our profit booking rate may decrease if the estimated cost to complete the contract increase all of the estimate are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate in addition comparability of our segment operating profit may be impacted by change in estimated profit booking rate on our contract accounted for using the poc method of accounting increase in the estimated profit booking rate typically referred to risk retirement usually relate to revision in the total estimated cost at completion that reflect improved condition on particular contract conversely condition on particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the total estimated cost at completion and reduction of the estimated profit booking rate increase or decrease in estimated profit booking rate are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception to date effect of such change segment operating profit may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other matter such the resolution of contractual matter reserve for dispute asset impairment and insurance recovery among others segment operating profit and item such risk retirement reduction of profit booking rate or other matter are presented net of state income tax our consolidated net adjustment not related to volume including net profit rate adjustment and other matter increased segment operating profit net of state income tax by approximately billion in billion in and billion in these adjustment increased net earnings by approximately billion per share in billion per share in and million per share in table of content service method of accounting for cost reimbursable contract for service to non government customer we record net sale service are performed except for award and incentive fee award and incentive fee are recorded when they are fixed or determinable generally at the date the amount is communicated to by the customer this approach result in the recognition of such fee at contractual interval typically every six month throughout the contract and is dependent on the customer process for notification of award and issuance of formal notification under fixed price service contract we are paid predetermined fixed amount for specified scope of work and generally have full responsibility for the cost associated with the contract and the resulting profit or loss we record net sale under fixed price service contract with non government customer on straight line basis over the period of contract performance unless evidence suggests that net sale are earned or the obligation are fulfilled in different pattern cost for all service contract are expensed incurred research and development and similar cost except for certain arrangement described below we account for independent research and development cost part of the general and administrative cost that are allocated among all of our contract and program in progress under government contractual arrangement and charged to

in the value of the corresponding plan liability equity method investment investment where we have the ability to exercise significant influence but do not control are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are included in other noncurrent asset on the balance sheet significant influence typically exists if we have to ownership interest in the investee under this method of accounting our share of the net earnings or loss of the investee is included in operating profit in other income net on the statement of earnings since the activity of the investee are closely aligned with the operation of the business segment holding the investment we evaluate our equity method investment for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of such investment may be impaired if decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other than temporary loss is recorded in earnings in the current period of december and our

variable rate borrowing to fixed rate borrowing in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate change on earnings these swap are designated cash flow hedge we may also enter into derivative instrument that are not designated hedge and do not qualify for hedge accounting which are intended to mitigate economic exposure we record derivative at their fair value the classification of gain

where we have been designated potentially responsible party prp substantial portion of environmental cost will be included in our net sale and cost of sale in future period pursuant to government regulation at the time liability is recorded for future environmental cost we record receivable for estimated future recovery considered probable through the pricing of product and service to agency of the government regardless of the contract form cost reimbursable fixed price we continuously evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing among other factor government regulation our government business base and contract mix and our history of receiving reimbursement of such cost we include the portion of those environmental cost expected to be allocated to our non government contract or that is determined to be unallowable for pricing under government contract in our cost of sale at the time the liability is established table of content at december and the aggregate amount of liability recorded relative to environmental matter wa million and million of which million and million is recorded in other noncurrent liability on the balance sheet at december and with the remainder recorded in other current liability we have recorded receivables totaling million and million at december and for the estimated future recovery of these cost we consider the recovery probable based on the factor previously mentioned of those amount million and million are recorded in other noncurrent asset on the balance sheet at december and with the remainder recorded in other current asset we project cost and recovery of cost over approximately year environmental cleanup activity usually span several year which make estimating liability matter of judgment because of such factor changing remediation technology assessment of the extent of contamination and continually evolving regulatory environmental standard we consider these and other factor in estimate of the timing and amount of any future cost that may be required for remediation activity which result in the calculation of range of estimate for particular environmental remediation site we perform quarterly review of the status of our environmental remediation site and the related liability and receivables we record liability when it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the cost to be incurred for remediation at particular site we do not discount the recorded liability the amount and timing of future cash payment are not fixed or can not be reliably determined we reasonably can not determine the extent of our financial exposure in all case at this time there are number of former operating facility that we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation in some case although loss may be probable it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activity because of uncertainty with respect to assessing the extent of the contamination or the applicable regulatory standard we also are pursuing claim for cost recovery contribution to site cleanup cost against other prps including the government both the environmental protection agency and the california office of environmental health hazard assessment announced plan in january to regulate two chemical perchlorate and hexavalent chromium to level in drinking water that are expected to be substantially lower than the existing public health goal or standard established in california the rulemaking process are lengthy and may take year to complete if substantially lower standard are adopted we would expect material increase in our estimate for environmental liability and the related asset for the portion of the increased cost that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our product and service for the government the amount that would be allocable to our non government contract or that is determined to be unallowable for pricing under government contract would be expensed which may have material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period we are conducting remediation activity including under various consent decree and order relating to soil groundwater sediment or surface water contamination at
