business financial condition or result of operation you should read these risk factor in conjunction with management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation in item and our consolidated financial statement and related note in item general economic condition both in the and internationally may adversely affect our result of operation we conduct operation in over country and territory our and international operation are subject to normal cycle affecting the economy in general well the local economic environment in which we operate the factor that create cyclical change to the economy and to our business are beyond our control and it may be difficult for to adjust our business model to mitigate the impact of these factor in particular our business is affected by level of industrial production consumer spending and retail activity and our business financial position and result of operation could be materially affected by adverse development in these aspect of the economy the united kingdom vote to leave the european union could result in economic uncertainty and instability resulting in fewer good being transported globally we face significant competition which could adversely affect our business financial position and result of operation we face significant competition on local regional national and international basis our competitor include the postal service of the and other nation various motor carrier express company freight forwarders air courier and others competition may also come from other source in the future some of our competitor have cost and organizational structure that differ from and may offer service and pricing term that we may not be willing or able to offer if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressure our business financial position and result of operation could be adversely affected the transportation industry continues to consolidate and competition remains strong result of consolidation our competitor may increase their market share and improve their financial capacity and may strengthen their competitive position business combination could also result in competitor providing wider variety of service and product at competitive price which could adversely affect our financial performance change in our relationship with our significant customer including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them could have an adverse impact on no single customer account for or more of our consolidated revenue we do not believe the loss of any single customer would materially impair our overall financial condition or result of operation however collectively some of our large customer might account for relatively significant portion of the growth in revenue in particular quarter or year these customer can drive the growth in revenue for particular service based on factor such new customer product launch trend in the commerce industry such the seasonality associated with the fourth quarter holiday season business merger and acquisition and the overall fast growth of customer underlying business these customer could choose to divert all or portion of their business with to one of our competitor demand pricing concession for our service require to provide enhanced service that increase our cost or develop their own shipping and distribution capability if these factor drove some of our large customer to cancel all or portion of their business relationship with it could materially impact the growth in our business and the ability to meet our current and long term financial forecast our business is subject to complex and stringent regulation in the and internationally we are subject to complex and stringent aviation transportation environmental security labor employment and other governmental law regulation and policy both in the and in the other country in which we operate in addition our business is impacted by law regulation and policy that affect global trade including tariff and trade policy export requirement tax monetary policy and other restriction and charge change in law regulation and policy and the related interpretation may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our cost of business the impact of new law regulation and policy can not be predicted compliance with new law and regulation may increase our operating cost or require significant capital expenditure any failure to comply with applicable law or regulation in the or in any of the country in which we operate could result in substantial fine or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operation which could adversely affect our financial performance security requirement could impose substantial cost on and we could be the target of an attack or have security breach result of concern about global terrorism and homeland security government around the world have adopted or may adopt stricter security requirement that will result in increased operating cost for business in the transportation industry these requirement may change periodically result of regulatory and legislative requirement and in response to evolving threat we can not determine the effect that these new requirement will have on our cost structure or our operating result and these rule or other future security requirement may increase our cost of operation and reduce operating efficiency regardless of our compliance with security requirement or the step we take to secure our facility or fleet we could be the target of an attack or security breach could occur which could adversely affect our operation or our reputation we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market response to such potential change concern over climate change including the impact of global warming ha led to significant federal state and international legislative and regulatory effort to limit greenhouse gas ghg emission for example in the past several year the congress ha considered various bill that would regulate ghg emission while these bill have not yet received sufficient congressional support for enactment some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future even in the absence of such legislation the environmental protection agency spurred by judicial interpretation of the clean air act may regulate ghg emission especially aircraft or diesel engine emission and this could impose substantial cost on these cost include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital cost associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicle prematurely the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we can not predict it effect on our cost structure or our operating result it is reasonably possible that such legislation or regulation could impose material cost on moreover even without such legislation or regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by company in the airline and transportation industry could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our service especially our air service strike work stoppage and slowdown by our employee could adversely affect our business financial position and result of operation significant number of our employee are employed under national master agreement and various supplemental agreement with local union affiliated with the teamster in addition our airline pilot airline mechanic ground mechanic and certain other employee are employed under other collective bargaining agreement strike work stoppage and slowdown by our employee could adversely affect our ability to meet our customer need and customer may do more business with competitor if they believe that such action or threatened action may adversely affect our ability to provide service we may face permanent loss of customer if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service and this could adversely affect our business financial position and result of operation the term of future collective bargaining agreement also may affect our competitive position and result of operation we are exposed to the effect of changing price of energy including gasoline diesel and jet fuel and interruption in supply of these commodity changing fuel and energy cost may have significant impact on our operation we require significant quantity of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicle and are exposed to the risk associated with variation in the market price for petroleum product including gasoline diesel and jet fuel we mitigate our exposure to changing fuel price through our indexed fuel surcharge and we may also enter into hedging transaction from time to time if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharge higher fuel cost could adversely impact our operating result even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharge high fuel surcharge may result in mix shift from our higher yielding air product to lower yielding ground product or an overall reduction in volume there can be no assurance that our hedging transaction will be effective to protect from change in fuel price moreover we could experience disruption in energy supply including our supply of gasoline diesel and jet fuel result of war action by producer or other factor beyond our control which could have an adverse effect on our business change in exchange rate or interest rate may have an adverse effect on our result we conduct business across the globe with significant portion of our revenue derived from operation outside the united state our operation in international market are affected by change in the exchange rate for local currency and in particular the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar are exposed to change in interest rate primarily on our short term debt and that portion of our long term debt that carry floating interest rate the impact of basis point change in interest rate affecting our debt is discussed in the quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk section of this report additionally change in interest rate impact the valuation of our pension and postretirement benefit obligation and the related benefit cost recognized in the income statement the impact of change in interest rate on our pension and postretirement benefit obligation and cost is discussed further in the critical accounting policy and estimate section of this report we monitor and manage our exposure to change in currency exchange rate and interest rate and make use of derivative instrument to mitigate the impact of change in these rate on our financial position and result of operation however change in exchange rate and interest rate can not always be predicted or hedged if we are unable to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation our business may suffer our success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the ups brand and our reputation for providing excellent service to our customer service quality issue actual or perceived even when false or unfounded could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customer to use other company also adverse publicity surrounding labor relation environmental concern security matter political activity and the like or attempt to connect our company to these sort of issue either in the united state or other country in which we operate could negatively affect our overall reputation and acceptance of our service by customer damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our service and thus have an adverse effect on our business financial position and result of operation and could require additional resource to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand significant privacy breach or it system disruption could adversely affect our business and we may be required to increase our spending on data and system security we rely on information technology network and system including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support variety of business process and activity in addition the provision of service to our customer and the operation of our network and system involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of customer employee and others our franchised center location also are reliant on the use of information technology system to manage their business process and activity our information technology system well those of our franchisees some of which are managed by third party may be susceptible to damage disruption or shutdown due to failure during the process of upgrading or replacing software database or component thereof power outage hardware failure computer virus attack by computer hacker malicious insider telecommunication failure user error or catastrophic event hacker acting individually or in coordinated group may also launch distributed denial of service attack or other coordinated attack that may cause service outage or other interruption in our business in addition breach in security could expose our customer and franchisees or the individual affected to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data the technique used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage system change frequently may be difficult to detect for long time and often are not recognized until launched against target result we may be unable to anticipate these technique or to implement adequate preventative measure any of these occurrence could result in disruption in our operation the loss of existing or potential customer damage to our brand and reputation and litigation and potential liability for the company in addition the cost and operational consequence of implementing further data or system protection measure could be significant in august broad based malware intrusion targeting retailer throughout the wa discovered and subsequently eradicated at approximately of our franchisees location while the impact of this cyber attack including the cost associated with investigation and remediation activity wa not material to our business and our financial result our effort to deter identify mitigate and or eliminate any future breach may not be successful severe weather or other natural or manmade disaster could adversely affect our business severe weather condition and other natural or manmade disaster including storm flood fire or earthquake epidemic or pandemic conflict or unrest or terrorist attack may result in decreased revenue our customer reduce their shipment or increased cost to operate our business which could have an adverse effect on our result of operation for quarter or year any such event affecting one of our major facility could result in significant interruption in or disruption of our business make significant capital investment in our business of which significant portion is tied to projected volume level we require significant capital investment in our business consisting of aircraft vehicle technology facility and sorting and other type of equipment to support both our existing business and anticipated growth forecasting projected volume involves many factor which are subject to uncertainty such general economic trend change in governmental regulation and competition if we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment need we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity either of which would negatively affect our revenue and profitability in addition to forecasting our capital investment requirement we adjust other element of our operation and cost structure in response to adverse economic condition however these adjustment may not be sufficient to allow to maintain our operating margin in weak economy we derive significant portion of our revenue from our international operation and are subject to the risk of doing business in international market we have significant international operation and while the geographical diversity of our international operation help ensure that we are not overly reliant on single region or country we are continually exposed to changing economic political and social development beyond our control emerging market are typically more volatile than those in the developed world and any broad based downturn in these market could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business financial position and result of operation we are subject to many law governing our international operation including those that prohibit improper payment to government official and commercial customer and restrict where we can do business our shipment to certain country and the information that we can provide to non government we are subject to change in market and our business plan that have resulted and may in the future result in substantial write down of the carrying value of our asset thereby reducing our net income our regular review of the carrying value of our asset ha resulted from time to time in significant impairment and we may in the future be required to recognize additional impairment charge change in business strategy government regulation or economic or market condition have resulted and may result in further substantial impairment of our intangible fixed or other asset at any time in the future in addition we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charge if we determine that the useful life of our fixed asset or intangible asset are shorter than we originally estimated such change could reduce our net income employee health and retiree health and pension benefit cost represent significant expense to our expense relating to employee health and retiree health and pension benefit are significant in recent year we have experienced significant increase in some of these cost largely result of economic factor beyond our control including in particular ongoing increase in health care cost well in excess of the rate of inflation and historically low discount rate that we use to value our benefit plan obligation continually increasing health care cost volatility in investment return and discount rate well change in law regulation and assumption used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expense may adversely affect our business financial position result of operation or require significant contribution to our benefit plan the new national master agreement with the ibt includes change that are designed to mitigate certain of these health care expense but there can be no assurance that our effort will be successful or that the failure or success of these effort will not adversely affect our business financial position result of operation or liquidity we participate in number of trustee managed multiemployer pension and health and welfare plan for employee covered under collective bargaining agreement part of the overall collective bargaining process for wage and benefit level we have agreed to contribute certain amount to the multiemployer benefit plan during the contract period the multiemployer benefit plan set benefit level and are responsible for benefit delivery to participant future contribution amount to multiemployer benefit plan will be determined only through collective bargaining and we have no additional legal or constructive obligation to increase contribution beyond the agreed upon amount except potential surcharge under the pension protection act of in the event that plan enters critical status and our contribution are not sufficient to satisfy any rehabilitation plan funding schedule in future collective bargaining negotiation we could agree to make significantly higher future contribution to improve the funded status of one or more of these plan the funded status of these multiemployer plan is impacted by various factor including investment performance health care inflation change in demographic and change in participant benefit level at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contribution if any or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition result of operation or liquidity could result from our participation in these plan addition to our on going multiemployer pension plan obligation we may have additional exposure with respect to benefit earned in the central state pension fund the cspf ups wa contributing employer to the cspf until when we withdrew from the plan and fully funded our allocable share of unfunded vested benefit by paying billion withdrawal liability under collective bargaining agreement with the international brotherhood of teamster ups agreed to provide coordinating benefit in the ups ibt full time employee pension plan ups ibt plan for ups participant retiring on or after january in the event that benefit are lawfully reduced by the cspf in the future in december congress passed the multiemployer pension reform act mpra which for the first time ever allowed multiemployer pension plan to reduce benefit payment to retiree subject to specific guideline in the statute and government oversight in september the cspf submitted proposed pension benefit reduction plan to the department of the treasury under the mpra the cspf plan proposed to reduce retirement benefit to the cspf participant including ups participant retiring on or after january we vigorously challenged the proposed benefit reduction plan because we believed that it not comply with the law and that certain action by the cspf were invalid on may the department of the treasury rejected the proposed plan submitted by the cspf stating that it failed to satisfy number of requirement set forth in the mpra the cspf ha asserted that it will become insolvent in which could lead to the reduction of retirement benefit although there are numerous factor that could affect the cspf status if the cspf were to become insolvent they have projected ups may be required to provide coordinating benefit thereby increasing the current projected benefit obligation for the ups ibt plan by approximately billion the cspf ha said that it belief legislative solution to it funding status is necessary and we expect that the cspf will continue to explore option to avoid insolvency the potential obligation to pay coordinating benefit from the ups ibt plan is subject to number of uncertainty including action that may be taken by the cspf the federal government or others these action include whether the cspf will submit revised pension benefit reduction plan or otherwise seek federal government assistance the extent to which benefit are paid by the pension benefit guaranty corporation well the effect of discount rate and various other actuarial assumption our best estimate of the measurement date of december is that we do not have any liability for additional coordinating benefit of the ups ibt plan however there are numerous uncertainty that exist regarding the ultimate resolution of the cspf situation and the current projected benefit obligation could materially increase these uncertainty are resolved we will continue to ass the impact of these uncertainty on the projected benefit obligation of the ups ibt plan in accordance with accounting standard codification topic compensation retirement benefit we may be subject to

year holiday retail sale grew in compared to last year mainly driven by online sale while the holiday season saw many category of traditional brick and mortar store struggle continued growth in commerce and omni channel retail sale ha driven package volume demand for residential product given these trend our product most aligned with business to consumer shipment have experienced the strongest growth outside the emerging market have stabilized in recent month and most developed nation have seen modest growth the impending exit of the united kingdom from the european union creates some uncertainty regarding it impact on global gdp the uneven nature of economic growth worldwide and fluctuation in currency market particularly the strengthening of the dollar have continued shifting trade pattern and weakened demand in certain trade lane result of these circumstance we continued to adjust our air capacity and cost structure in our transportation network to better match the prevailing volume level our broad portfolio of product offering and the flexibility inherent in our transportation network have helped adapt to these changing trend while the worldwide economic environment remained challenging in we have continued to undertake several initiative in the and internationally to improve the flexibility and capacity in our transportation network improve yield management and increase operational efficiency and contain cost across all segment most notably the continued deployment of technology improvement including several facility automation project and the

consolidated financial statement for discussion of accounting standard issued but not yet effective critical accounting policy and estimatesour discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operation are based on our consolidated financial statement which are prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america indicated in note to our consolidated financial statement the amount of asset liability revenue and expense reported in our financial statement are affected by estimate and judgment that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principle we base our estimate on prior experience and other assumption that we consider reasonable to our circumstance actual result could differ from our estimate which would affect the related amount reported in our consolidated financial statement while estimate and judgment are applied in arriving at many reported amount we believe that the following matter may involve higher degree of judgment and complexity contingenciesas discussed in note to our consolidated financial statement we are involved in various legal proceeding and contingency the event that may impact our contingent liability are often unique and generally are not predictable at the time contingency is identified we consider all relevant fact part of our evaluation we record liability for loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable event may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of contingency may result in loss to that differs from our previously estimated liability these factor could result in material difference between estimated and actual operating result contingent loss that are probable and estimable excluding those related to income tax and self insurance which are discussed further below were not material to our financial position or result of operation of and for the year ended december in addition we have certain contingent liability that have not been recognized of december because loss is not reasonably estimable goodwill and intangible impairmentwe perform impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting unit on an annual basis our reporting unit are comprised of the domestic package europe asia america and ismea indian subcontinent middle east and africa reporting unit in the international package reporting segment and the forwarding logistics ups mail innovation ups freight the ups store ups capital marken and coyote logistics reporting unit in the supply chain freight reporting segment our annual goodwill impairment testing date is october for each reporting unit owned at the testing date in assessing goodwill for impairment we initially evaluate qualitative factor to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of reporting unit then we utilize two step process to test goodwill for impairment first comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying value including goodwill is performed if the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill parcel service inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operationswe primarily determine the fair value of our reporting unit using discounted cash flow model dcf model and supplement this with observable valuation multiple for comparable company appropriate the completion of the dcf model requires that we make number of significant assumption to produce an estimate of future cash flow these assumption include projection of future revenue cost capital expenditure and working capital change in addition we make assumption about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variable required in estimating the fair value of our reporting unit the projection that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business condition for each of our reporting unit the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves significant level of judgment in these assumption and change in our business strategy government regulation or economic or market condition could significantly impact these judgment we routinely monitor market condition and other factor to determine if interim impairment test are necessary if impairment indicator are present in future period the resulting impairment charge could have material impact on our result of operation none of the reporting unit incurred any goodwill impairment charge in or change in our forecast could cause carrying value of our reporting unit to exceed their fair value in future period potentially resulting in goodwill impairment charge decrease in the estimated fair value for any of our reporting unit of our most recent goodwill testing date october would not result in goodwill impairment charge trade name with carrying value of million and license with carrying value of million of december are considered to be indefinite lived intangible and therefore are not amortized impairment test for indefinite lived intangible are performed on an annual basis we determined that the income approach specifically the relief from royalty method is the most appropriate valuation method for the trade name the estimated fair value of the trade name is compared to the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value of the trade name exceeds it estimated fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds it fair value this valuation approach requires that we make number of assumption to estimate fair value these assumption include projection of future revenue market royalty rate tax rate discount rate and other relevant variable the projection we use in the model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business condition all of our remaining recorded intangible asset are deemed to be finite lived intangible and are thus amortized over their estimated useful life impairment test for these intangible asset are only performed when triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flow of the intangible if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable write down to fair value is recorded fair value are determined based on dcf model there were no impairment of any indefinite lived or finite lived intangible asset in or self insurance accrualswe self insure cost associated with worker compensation claim automotive liability health and welfare and general business liability up to certain limit insurance reserve are established for estimate of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claim well estimate of claim that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balance are based on reserve level which incorporate historical loss experience and judgment about the present and expected level of cost per claim trend in actual experience are significant factor in the determination of such reserve we believe our estimated reserve for such claim are adequate but actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimate and affect our result of operation worker compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claim may take several year to completely settle consequently actuarial estimate are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claim number of factor can affect the actual cost of claim including the length of time the claim remains open trend in health care cost and the result of related litigation furthermore claim may emerge in future year for event that occurred in prior year at rate that differs from previous actuarial projection change in state legislation with respect to worker compensation can affect the adequacy of our self insurance accrual all of these factor can result in revision to prior actuarial projection and produce material difference between estimated and actual operating result we sponsor number of health and welfare insurance plan for our employee these liability and related expense are based on estimate of the number of employee and eligible dependent covered under the plan anticipated medical usage by participant and overall trend in medical cost and inflation actual result may differ from these estimate and

discount rate health care cost trend rate inflation compensation increase rate expected return on plan asset mortality rate and other factor the assumption utilized in recording the obligation under our plan represent our best estimate and we believe that they are reasonable based on information to historical experience and performance well other factor that might cause future expectation to differ from past trend difference in actual experience or change in assumption may affect our pension and other postretirement obligation and future expense the primary factor contributing to actuarial gain and loss each year are change in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligation of the measurement date difference between the expected and the actual

of treasury under the mpra the cspf plan proposed to reduce retirement benefit to the cspf participant including the ups transfer group we vigorously challenged the proposed benefit reduction plan

the withdrawal agreement with the cspf on may the department of treasury rejected the proposed plan submitted by the cspf stating that it failed to satisfy number of requirement set forth in the mpra

incorporate this solution rather our best estimate of the next most likely outcome to resolve the cspf solvency concern is that the cspf will make another mpra filing to forestall insolvency without reducing benefit to the ups transfer group if the cspf attempt to reduce benefit for the ups transfer group under mpra filing we would be in strong legal position to prevent that from occurring given that these benefit can not be reduced without our consent and such reduction without first exhausting reduction to other group in the cspf would be contrary to the statute accordingly our best estimate of the measurement date of december is that there is no liability to be recognized for additional coordinating benefit of the ups ibt plan however the projected benefit obligation could materially increase these uncertainty are resolved we will continue to ass the impact of these uncertainty on the projected benefit obligation of the ups ibt plan in accordance with asc parcel service inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operationsdepreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assetsas of december we had billion of net fixed asset the most significant category of which is aircraft in accounting for fixed asset we make estimate about the expected useful life and the expected residual value of the asset and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the asset and the cash flow generated by these asset in estimating the life and expected residual value of aircraft we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft type subsequent revision to these estimate could be caused by change to our maintenance program change in the utilization of the aircraft governmental regulation on aging aircraft and changing market price of new and used aircraft of the same or similar type we periodically evaluate these estimate and assumption and adjust the estimate and assumption necessary adjustment to the expected life and residual value are accounted for on prospective basis through depreciation expense we review long lived asset for impairment when circumstance indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flow of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable write down to fair value is recorded fair value are determined based on quoted market value discounted cash flow or external appraisal appropriate we review long lived asset for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flow can be identified the circumstance that would indicate potential impairment may include but are not limited to significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized and operating or cash flow loss associated with the use of the asset in estimating cash flow we project future volume level for our different air express product in all geographic region in which we do business adverse change in these volume forecast or shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projection could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand this situation could lead to an excess of particular aircraft type resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type thus resulting in increased depreciation expense there were no impairment charge on our property plant and equipment during and fair value measurementsin the normal course of business we hold and issue financial instrument that contain element of market risk including derivative marketable security finance receivables pension asset other investment and debt certain of these financial instrument are required to be recorded at fair value principally derivative marketable security pension asset and certain other investment fair value are based on listed market price when such price are available to the extent that listed market price are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factor including dealer price quotation certain financial instrument including over the counter derivative instrument are valued using pricing model that consider among other factor contractual and market price correlation time value credit spread and yield curve volatility factor change in the fixed income foreign exchange and commodity market will impact our estimate of fair value in the future potentially affecting our result of operation quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to change in commodity price foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate is presented in the quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk section of this report we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible asset acquired liability assumed and intangible asset acquired based on their estimated fair value the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these identifiable asset and liability is recorded goodwill such valuation require management to make significant estimate and assumption especially with respect to intangible asset significant estimate in valuing certain intangible asset include but are not limited to future expected cash flow from acquired customer technology and trade name from market participant perspective useful life and discount rate management estimate of fair value are based upon assumption believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and result actual result may differ from estimate during the measurement period which is one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustment to the asset

statement purpose these estimate and judgment occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction tax credit benefit and deduction and in the calculation of deferred tax asset and liability which arise from difference in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purpose well tax interest and penalty related to uncertain tax position significant change to these estimate may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in subsequent period we ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for tax by recording valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover substantial majority of the deferred tax asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet however should there be change in our ability to recover our deferred tax asset our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery wa not likely the calculation of our tax liability involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulation we recognize liability for uncertain tax position based on two step process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any it is determined that the position meet the recognition threshold the second step requires to estimate and measure the the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement the difference between the amount of recognizable tax benefit and the total amount of tax benefit from position filed or to be filed with the tax authority is recorded liability for uncertain tax benefit it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amount we have to determine the probability of various possible outcome we reevaluate uncertain tax position on quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factor including but not limited to change in fact or circumstance change in tax law effectively settled issue under audit and new audit activity such change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision allowance for doubtful accountslosses on account receivable are recognized when they are

assume instantaneous parallel shift in exchange rate interest rate yield curve and commodity and equity price for option and instrument with non linear return model appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shift there are certain limitation inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented primarily due to the assumption that exchange rate change in parallel fashion and that interest rate change instantaneously in addition the analysis are unable to reflect the complex market reaction that normally would arise from the market shift modeled while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario these estimate should not be viewed forecast we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive

we are required to test goodwill on reporting unit basis reporting unit is the operating segment unless for business within that operating segment discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management in which case such component business is the reporting unit in assessing goodwill for impairment we initially evaluate qualitative factor to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount we consider several factor including macroeconomic condition industry and market condition overall financial performance of the reporting unit change in management strategy or customer and relevant reporting unit specific event such change in the carrying amount of net asset more likely than not expectation of selling or disposing all or portion of reporting unit and the testing for recoverability of significant asset group within reporting unit if this qualitative assessment result in conclusion that it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit exceeds the carrying value then no further testing is performed for that reporting unit parcel service inc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statementsif the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of reporting unit then we utilize two step process to test goodwill for impairment first comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying value including goodwill is performed if the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds it calculated fair value then the second step is performed and an impairment charge is recognized for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds it implied fair value we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting unit using discounted cash flow model and supplement this with observable valuation multiple for comparable company appropriate trade name with carrying value of million and license with carrying value of million of december are considered to be indefinite lived intangible and therefore are not amortized indefinite lived intangible asset are reviewed for impairment at least annually we determined that the income approach specifically the relief from royalty method is the most appropriate valuation method to estimate the fair value of the coyote trade name the estimated fair value of the trade name is compared to the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value of the trade name exceeds it estimated fair value an impairment charge is

presentation of deferred tax asset and liability the update remove the requirement to separate deferred tax liability and asset into current and non current amount in classified statement of financial position the update permit the entity to present deferred tax liability and asset non current in classified statement of financial position we adopted this standard on retrospective basis in the fourth quarter of this accounting standard update did not have material impact on our consolidated financial position or result of operation in september the fasb issued an accounting standard update that simplifies the accounting for measurement period adjustment related to business combination this update remove the requirement to retrospectively apply adjustment made to estimated amount recognized in business combination this update permit the purchaser to adjust the estimated amount in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount are determined this new guidance would have become effective for in the first quarter of however we elected to early adopt this standard in the third quarter of this accounting standard update did not have material impact on our consolidated financial position or result of operation in april the fasb issued an accounting standard update to simplify the presentation of debt issuance cost this update amends existing guidance to require the presentation of debt issuance cost in the consolidated balance sheet direct deduction from the carrying amount of the associated debt liability instead of deferred charge in august the fasb issued updated guidance pertaining to the presentation of debt issuance cost related to line of credit arrangement this update allows an entity to defer and present debt issuance cost an asset subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance cost over the term of the line of credit arrangement regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowing on the line of credit arrangement we elected to early adopt this standard in the fourth quarter of on retrospective basis this accounting standard update did not have material impact on our consolidated financial position or result of operation in may the fasb issued an accounting standard update that change the disclosure requirement for reporting investment at fair value this update remove the requirement to categorize investment for which fair value is measured using the net asset value nav per share practical expedient within the fair value hierarchy these disclosure are limited to investment for which the entity ha elected to measure fair value using the practical expedient substantially all of our level pension and postretirement benefit plan asset were measured using nav practical expedient this guidance became effective for in the first quarter of and did not have material impact on our consolidated financial position or result of operation in june the fasb issued an accounting standard update for company that grant their employee share based payment in which the term of the award provide that performance target that affect vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period this guidance became effective for in the first quarter of and did not have material impact on our consolidated financial position result of operation or cash flow parcel service inc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statementsaccounting standard issued but not yet effectivein november the fasb issued an accounting standard update that is intended to reduce diversity in practice by adding or clarifying guidance on classification and presentation of change in restricted cash on the statement of cash flow the guidance in this update should be applied retrospectively and becomes effective for in the first quarter of but early adoption is permitted result of this update restricted cash will be included within cash and cash equivalent on our statement of consolidated cash flow of december and we had and million in self insurance investment and restricted cash respectively in august the fasb issued an accounting standard update that address the classification and presentation of specific cash flow issue that currently result in diverse practice the guidance also clarifies how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipt and cash payment have aspect of more than one class of cash flow the guidance will generally be applied retrospectively and becomes effective for in the first quarter of but early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our statement of consolidated cash flow but do not expect this standard to have material impact in march the fasb issued an accounting standard update that simplifies the income tax accounting and cash flow presentation related to share based compensation by requiring the recognition of all excess tax benefit and deficiency directly on the income statement and classification cash flow from operating activity on the statement of cash flow this new guidance becomes effective for in the first quarter of we have evaluated adoption of this update and determined that the impact to income tax expense in the statement of consolidated income for the first quarter of will be benefit of approximately million which will result in reclassification of approximately million from net cash from financing activity to net cash from operating activity in the statement of consolidated cash flow in february the fasb issued an accounting standard update that requires lessee to recognize right of use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all lease with term beyond twelve month although the distinction between operating and finance lease will continue to exist under the new standard the recognition and measurement of expense and cash flow will not change significantly from the current treatment this new guidance requires modified retrospective application and becomes effective for in the first quarter of but early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating this update to determine the full impact of it adoption on our consolidated financial position result of operation cash flow and related disclosure well the impact of adoption on policy practice and system of december we have billion of future minimum operating lease commitment that are not currently recognized on our consolidated balance sheet see note therefore we expect material change to our consolidated balance sheet in january the fasb issued an accounting standard update which address certain aspect of the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instrument the amendment will be effective for beginning the first quarter of at this time we do not expect this accounting standard update to have material impact on our consolidated financial position result of operation or cash flow in may the fasb issued an accounting standard update that change the revenue recognition for company that enter into contract with customer to transfer good or service the standard is comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in manner depicting the transfer of good or service to customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those good or service the fasb ha also issued number of update to this standard we are planning to adopt the standard on january company may use either full retrospective or modified retrospective approach to adopt this standard we are currently evaluating this standard and the related update including which transition approach to use well the impact of adoption on policy practice and system at this stage in the evaluation we expect that revenue recognition will be accelerated for the transportation business the standard requires revenue to be recognized control is transferred to the customer over time rather than upon delivery we are currently quantifying the impact of this change to the statement of consolidated income the standard also requires to evaluate whether our business promise to transfer service to the customer principal or to arrange for service to be provided by another party an agent to make that determination the standard us control model rather than the risk and reward model in current gaap based on our evaluation of the control model we determined that certain supply chain freight business act the principal rather than the agent within their revenue arrangement this change will require the affected business to report transportation revenue gross of associated purchase transportation cost rather than net of such amount within the statement of consolidated income we are currently quantifying the amount of revenue impacted by this change additionally contract review are ongoing and more business could be impacted by the adoption of the standard parcel service inc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial

rate for our pension and postretirement benefit plan we use bond matching approach to select specific bond that would satisfy our projected benefit payment we believe the bond matching approach reflects the process we would employ to settle our pension and postretirement benefit obligation for our international plan the discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flow of sample plan of similar duration to yield curve based on long term high quality fixed income debt instrument available of the measurement date these assumption are updated each measurement date which is

for plan in october the soa published an updated improvement scale which reduced expected mortality improvement from previously published scale based on our perspective of future longevity we updated the mortality assumption to incorporate this updated scale for purpose of measuring pension and other postretirement benefit obligation at december assumption for the expected return on plan asset are used to determine component of net periodic benefit cost for the fiscal year the assumption for our plan wa developed using long term projection of return for each asset class and taking into consideration our target asset allocation the expected return for each asset class is function of passive long term capital market assumption and excess return generated from active management the capital market assumption used are provided by independent investment advisor while excess return assumption are supported by historical performance fund mandate and investment expectation for plan outside the consideration is given to local market expectation of long term return strategic asset allocation are determined by plan based on the nature of liability and considering the demographic composition of the plan participant actuarial assumption central state pension fundups wa contributing employer to the central state pension fund cspf until when we withdrew from the plan and fully funded our allocable share of unfunded vested benefit by paying billion withdrawal liability under collective bargaining agreement with the international brotherhood of teamster ibt ups agreed to provide coordinating benefit in the ups ibt full time employee pension plan ups ibt plan for ups participant whose last employer wa ups and who had not retired of january the ups transfer group in the event that benefit are lawfully reduced by the cspf in the future consistent with the term of our withdrawal agreement with the cspf in december congress passed the multiemployer pension reform act mpra which for the first time ever allowed multiemployer pension plan to reduce benefit payment to retiree subject to specific guideline in the statute and government approval in september the cspf submitted proposed pension benefit reduction plan to the department of the treasury under the mpra the cspf plan proposed to reduce retirement benefit to the cspf participant including the ups transfer group we vigorously challenged the proposed benefit reduction plan because we believed that it did not comply with the law and that the cspf failed to comply with it contractual obligation to obtain our consent to reduce benefit to the ups transfer group under the term of the withdrawal agreement with the cspf on may the department of the treasury rejected the proposed plan submitted by the cspf stating that it failed to satisfy number of requirement set forth in the mpra the cspf ha asserted that it will become insolvent in which could lead to the reduction of retirement benefit although there are numerous factor that could affect the cspf funding status if the cspf were to become insolvent they have projected ups may be required to provide coordinating benefit thereby increasing the current projected benefit obligation for the ups ibt plan by approximately billion the cspf ha said that it belief legislative solution to it funding status is necessary and we expect that the cspf will continue to explore option to avoid insolvency the potential obligation to pay coordinating benefit from the ups ibt plan is subject to number of significant uncertainty including action that may be taken by the cspf the federal government or others these action include whether the cspf will submit revised pension benefit reduction plan or otherwise seek federal government assistance the extent to which benefit are paid by the pension benefit guaranty corporation our ability to successfully defend our legal position well the effect of discount rate and various other actuarial assumption parcel service inc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statementswe account for this potential obligation under accounting standard codification topic compensation retirement benefit asc under asc we are required to provide best estimate of various actuarial assumption including the eventual outcome of this matter in measuring our pension benefit obligation at the december measurement date while we currently believe the most likely solution to this matter and the broader systemic problem facing multi employer pension plan is intervention by the federal government asc doe not permit anticipation of change in law in making best estimate of pension liability our best estimate of the measurement date of december doe not incorporate this solution rather our best estimate of the next most likely outcome to resolve the cspf solvency concern is that the cspf will make another mpra filing to forestall insolvency without reducing benefit to the ups transfer group if the cspf attempt to reduce benefit for the ups transfer group under mpra filing we would be in strong legal position to prevent that from occurring given that these benefit can not be reduced without our consent and such reduction without first exhausting reduction to other group in the cspf would be contrary to the statute accordingly our best estimate of the measurement date of december is that there is no liability to be recognized for additional coordinating benefit of the ups ibt plan however the projected benefit obligation could materially increase these uncertainty are resolved we will continue to ass the impact of these uncertainty on the projected benefit obligation of the ups ibt plan in accordance with asc other actuarial assumptionshealthcare cost trend are used to project future postretirement benefit payable from our plan for year end plan obligation future postretirement medical benefit cost were forecasted assuming an initial annual increase of
