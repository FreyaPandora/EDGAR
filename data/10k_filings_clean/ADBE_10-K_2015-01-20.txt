materially from our forward looking statement factor that might cause or contribute to such difference include but are not limited to those discussed below these and many other factor described in this report could adversely affect our operation performance and financial condition if we can not continue to develop market and offer new product and service or enhancement to existing product and service that meet customer requirement our operating result could suffer the process of developing new high technology product and service and enhancing existing product and service is complex costly and uncertain if we fail to anticipate customer changing need and emerging technological trend our market share and result of operation could suffer we must make long term investment develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resource before knowing whether our prediction will accurately reflect customer demand for our product and service if we are unable to extend our core technology into new application and new platform and to anticipate or respond to technological change the market acceptance of our product and service could decline and our result would suffer additionally any delay in the development production marketing or offering of new product or service or enhancement to an existing product or service could result in customer attrition or impede our ability to attract new customer causing decline in our revenue earnings or stock price and weakening our competitive position we maintain strategic relationship with third party to market certain of our product and support certain product functionality if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our strategic relationship with these third party our ability to compete in the marketplace to reach new customer and geography or to grow our revenue would be impaired and our operating result would suffer we offer our product on variety of pc tablet and mobile device recent trend have shown technological shift from personal computer to tablet and mobile device if we can not continue to adapt our product to tablet and mobile device our business could be harmed to the extent that consumer purchase of these device slow or to the extent that significant demand arises for our product or competitive product on other platform before we offer our product on those platform our business could be harmed release of new device or operating system may make it more difficult for our product to perform or may require significant cost in order for to adapt our solution to such device or operating system these potential cost and delay could harm our business introduction of new product service and business model by existing and new competitor could harm our competitive position and result of operation the market for our product and service are characterized by intense competition evolving industry standard emerging business and distribution model disruptive technology development short product and service life cycle price sensitivity on the part of customer and frequent new product introduction including alternative with limited functionality available at lower cost or free of charge any of these factor could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margin and could adversely affect our renewal and upgrade rate well our ability to attract new customer our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing product and service introduce new product and service on timely and cost effective basis meet changing customer need extend our core technology into new application and anticipate and respond to emerging standard business model software delivery method and other technological development such the evolution and emergence of digital application marketplace direct sale and software delivery environment these digital application marketplace often have of contentsexclusive distribution for certain platform which may make it more difficult for to compete in these market if any competing product service or operating system that support our solution achieve widespread acceptance our operating result could suffer in addition consolidation ha occurred among some of the competitor in the market in which we compete further consolidation in these market may subject to increased competitive pressure and may therefore harm our result of operation for additional information regarding our competition and the risk arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate see the section entitled competition contained in item of this report if we fail to successfully manage transition to new business model and market our result of operation could suffer we often release new offering and employ new software and service delivery method in connection with our diversification into new business model and market it is uncertain whether these strategy will prove successful or whether we will be able to develop the necessary infrastructure and business model more quickly than our competitor market acceptance of new product and service offering will be dependent on our ability to include functionality and usability that address certain customer requirement where our operating history is le extensive and to optimally price our product in light of marketplace condition our cost and customer demand new product and service offering could subject to increased risk of liability related to the provision of service well cause to incur significant technical legal or other cost for example with our cloud based service and subscription based licensing model such creative cloud we have entered market that may not be fully accustomed to cloud based subscription offering market acceptance of such service is affected by variety of factor including information security reliability performance social community engagement local government regulation regarding online service and user generated content the sufficiency of technological infrastructure to support our product in certain geography customer concern with entrusting third party to store and manage their data public concern regarding data privacy and the enactment of law or regulation that restrict our ability to provide such service to customer in the or internationally if we are unable to respond to these threat our business could be harmed from time to time we open source certain of our technology initiative provide broader open access to our technology license certain of our technology on royalty free basis and release selected technology for industry standardization additionally customer requirement for open standard or open source product could impact adoption or use of some of our product or service to the extent we incorrectly predict customer requirement for such product or service or if there is delay in market acceptance of such product or service our business could be harmed we also devote significant resource to the development of technology and service offering in market where our operating history is le extensive these new offering and market may require considerable investment of technical financial compliance and sale resource and scalable organization some of our competitor may have advantage over due to their larger presence larger developer network deeper market experience and larger sale consulting and marketing resource if we are unable to successfully establish new offering in light of the competitive environment our result of operation could suffer the increased emphasis on cloud strategy may give rise to risk that could harm our business over the past several year our business ha shifted away from pre packaged creative software to focus on subscription model that price and delivers our product in way that differs from the historical pricing and delivery method of our creative tool these change reflect significant shift from perpetual license sale and distribution of our software in favor of providing our customer the right to access certain of our software in hosted environment or use downloaded software for specified subscription period this cloud strategy requires continued investment in product development and cloud operation and may give rise to number of risk including the following if customer desire only perpetual license or to purchase or renew only point product subscription rather than acquire the entire creative cloud offering our subscription sale may lag behind our expectation our cloud strategy may raise concern among our customer base including concern regarding change to pricing over time service availability information security of cloud solution and access to file while offline or subscription ha expired small business and hobbyist may turn to competitive or open source offering we may be unsuccessful in maintaining our target pricing new seat adoption and projected renewal rate we may select target price that is not optimal and could negatively affect our sale or earnings or we may have to rely heavily on promotional rate to achieve target seat adoption which could reduce average revenue per user of content the removal of general availability of creative suite on perpetual licensing basis from legacy shrinkwrap and volume licensing channel which we announced during our second quarter of fiscal could further reduce our revenue in the short term our business shift to subscription revenue that is recognized ratably and we may incur cost at higher than forecasted rate we expand our cloud operation subscription offering and etlas create risk related to the timing of revenue recognition although the subscription model is designed to increase the number of customer who purchase our product and service and create recurring revenue stream that is more predictable it creates certain risk related to the timing of revenue recognition and potential reduction in cash flow portion of the subscription based revenue we report each quarter result from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreement entered into during previous quarter decline in new or renewed subscription in any period may not be immediately reflected in our reported financial result for that period but may result in decline in our revenue in future quarter if we were to experience significant downturn in subscription sale and renewal rate our reported financial result might not reflect such downturn until future period our subscription model could also make it difficult for to rapidly increase our revenue from subscription based or hosted service through additional sale in any period revenue from new customer will be recognized over the applicable subscription term further any increase in sale under our subscription sale model could result in decreased revenue over the short term if they are offset by decline in sale from perpetual license customer additionally in connection with our sale effort to enterprise customer and our use of etlas number of factor could affect our revenue including longer than expected sale and implementation cycle potential deferral of revenue due to multiple element revenue arrangement and alternate licensing arrangement if any of our assumption about revenue from our new business or our addition of subscription based model prove incorrect our actual result may vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected we may be unable to predict subscription renewal rate and the impact these rate may have on our future revenue and operating result the hosted business model we utilize in our adobe marketing cloud offering typically involves selling service on subscription basis pursuant to service agreement that are generally one to three year in length our individual creative cloud subscription agreement are generally month to month or one year in length etlas for our digital medium product and service are generally three year in length and subscription agreement for other product and service may provide for shorter or longer term although many of our service and subscription agreement contain automatic renewal term our customer have no obligation to renew their subscription for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period and some customer elect not to renew we can not provide assurance that these subscription will be renewed at the or higher level of service for the same number of seat license or for the same duration of time if at all moreover under certain circumstance some of our customer have the right to cancel their service agreement prior to the expiration of the term of their agreement we can not be assured that we will be able to accurately predict future customer renewal rate our customer renewal rate may decline or fluctuate result of number of factor including their level of satisfaction with our service the reliability including uptime of our subscription service the price of our service the perceived information security of our system and service the price of service offered by our competitor merger and acquisition affecting our customer base reduction in our customer spending level or decline in customer activity result of economic downturn or uncertainty in financial market if our customer do not renew their subscription for our service or if they renew on le favorable term to our revenue may decline our future growth is also affected by our ability to sell additional feature and service to our current customer which depends on number of factor including customer satisfaction with our product and service the price of our offering and general economic condition if our effort to cross sell and upsell to our customer are unsuccessful the rate at which our business grows might decline security vulnerability in our product and system could lead to reduced revenue or to liability claim maintaining the security of our product computer and network is critical issue for and our customer security researcher criminal hacker and other third party regularly develop new technique to penetrate computer and

and deliver our product and service to customer we devote significant resource to address security vulnerability through engineering more secure product enhancing security and reliability feature in our product and system code hardening conducting rigorous penetration test deploying security update to address security vulnerability and improving our incident response time but these security vulnerability can not be totally eliminated the cost of these step could reduce our operating margin and we may be unable to implement these measure quickly enough to prevent cyber attacker from gaining unauthorized access into our system and product despite our preventative effort actual or perceived security vulnerability in our product and system may harm our reputation or lead to claim against and have in the past lead to such claim and could lead some customer to seek to return product to stop using certain service to reduce or delay future purchase of product or service or to use

fiscal period through of contentsitem management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statement and note thereto acquisition during fiscal we completed business acquisition which wa not material to our consolidated financial statement during fiscal we completed our acquisition of privately held neolane leader in cross channel campaign management technology for million and privately held behance an online social medium platform to showcase and discover creative work for million during fiscal we integrated neolane and behance into our digital marketing and digital medium reportable segment respectively the impact of these acquisition wa not material to our consolidated financial statement during fiscal we completed the acquisition of privately held efficient frontier multi channel digital ad buying and optimization company for million during fiscal we began integrating efficient frontier into our digital marketing segment see note of our note to consolidated financial statement for further information regarding these acquisition critical accounting policy and estimatesin preparing our consolidated financial statement in accordance with gaap and pursuant to the rule and regulation of the sec we make assumption judgment and estimate that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent asset and liability we base our assumption judgment and estimate on historical experience and various other factor that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance actual result could differ materially from these estimate under different assumption or condition on regular basis we evaluate our assumption judgment and estimate we also discus our critical accounting policy and estimate with the audit committee of the board of director we believe that the assumption judgment and estimate involved in the accounting for revenue recognition business combination goodwill impairment and income tax have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statement these area are key component of our result of operation and are based on complex rule requiring to make judgment and estimate so we consider these to be our critical accounting policy historically our assumption judgment and estimate relative to our critical accounting policy have not differed materially from actual result revenue recognitionour revenue is derived from the licensing of perpetual time based and subscription software product associated software maintenance and support plan non software related hosted service consulting service training and technical support we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criterion have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we have delivered the product or performed the service the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable determining whether and when some of these criterion have been satisfied often involves assumption and judgment that can have significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report we enter into multiple element revenue arrangement in which customer may purchase combination of software upgrade maintenance and support hosted service and consulting for our software and software related multiple element arrangement we must determine whether and when each element ha been delivered determine whether undelivered product or service are essential to the functionality of the delivered product and service determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe and allocate the total price among the various element vsoe of fair value is used to allocate portion of the price to the undelivered element and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered element absent vsoe revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all element of the arrangement have been delivered however if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period change in assumption or judgment or change to the element in software arrangement could cause material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in particular period of contentswe determine vsoe for each element based on historical stand alone sale to third party or from the stated renewal rate for the element contained in the initial arrangement in determining vsoe we require that substantial majority of the selling price for product or service fall within reasonably narrow pricing range we have established vsoe for our software maintenance and support service custom software development service consulting service and training when such service are sold optionally with software license for multiple element arrangement containing our non software service we must determine whether and when each element ha been delivered determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vsoe of selling price third party evidence tpe of selling price or best estimated selling price besp applicable and allocate the total price among the various element based on the relative selling price method for multiple element arrangement that contain both software and non software element we allocate revenue to software or software related element group and any non software element separately based on the selling price hierarchy we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vsoe of selling price if it exists or tpe of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for deliverable we use besp once revenue is allocated to software or software related element group we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance revenue is recognized when revenue recognition criterion are met for each element we are generally unable to establish vsoe or tpe for non software element and such we use besp besp is generally used for offering that are not typically sold on stand alone basis or for new or highly customized offering we determine besp for product or service by considering multiple factor including but not limited to major product grouping geography market condition competitive landscape internal cost gross margin objective and pricing practice pricing practice taken into consideration include historic contractually stated price volume discount where applicable and our price list we must estimate certain royalty revenue amount due to the timing of securing information from our customer while we believe we can make reliable estimate regarding these matter these estimate are inherently subjective accordingly our assumption and judgment regarding future product and service well our estimate of royalty revenue could differ from actual event thus materially impacting our financial position and result of operation product revenue is recognized when the above criterion are met we reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future return price protection and rebate at the time the related revenue is recorded in determining our estimate for return and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributor on which we have recognized revenue we rely upon historical data the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel the rate at which our product sell through to the end user product plan and other factor our estimated provision for return can vary from what actually occurs product return may be more or le than what wa estimated the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs there could be delay in the release of our product these factor and unanticipated change in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimate differ from actual return thus impacting our financial position and result of operation in the future actual return and price protection may exceed our estimate unsold product in the distribution channel are exposed to rapid change in consumer preference market condition or technological obsolescence due to new platform product update or competing product while we believe we can make reliable estimate regarding these matter these estimate are inherently subjective accordingly if our estimate change our return and price protection reserve would change which would impact the total net revenue we report we recognize revenue for hosted service that are based on committed number of transaction ratably beginning on the date the customer commences use of our service and continuing through the end of the customer term over usage fee and fee billed based on the actual number of transaction from which we capture data are billed in accordance with contract term these fee are incurred we record amount that have been invoiced in account receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criterion have been met our consulting revenue is recognized on time and material basis and is measured monthly based on input measure such on hour incurred to date compared to total estimated hour to complete with consideration given to output measure such contract milestone when applicable business combinationswe allocate the purchase price of acquired company to the tangible and intangible asset acquired and liability assumed assumed equity award well to in process research and development based upon their estimated fair value at the acquisition of contentsdate the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimate and assumption especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible asset deferred revenue obligation and equity assumed although we believe the assumption and estimate we have made are reasonable they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain example of critical estimate in valuing certain of the intangible asset we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flow from software license sale subscription support agreement consulting contract and acquired developed technology and patent expected cost to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable product and estimated cash flow from the project when completed the acquired company trade name and trademark well assumption about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in the combined company product portfolio and discount rate in connection with the purchase price allocation for our acquisition we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligation assumed the estimated fair value of the support obligation is determined utilizing cost build up approach the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the cost related to fulfilling the obligation plus normal profit margin the estimated cost to fulfill the obligation are based on the historical cost related to fulfilling the obligation in connection with the purchase price allocation for our acquisition we estimate the fair value of the equity award assumed the estimated fair value is determined utilizing modified binomial option pricing model which assumes employee exercise their stock option when the share price exceeds the strike price by certain dollar threshold if the acquired company ha significant historical data on their employee exercise behavior then this threshold is determined based upon the acquired company history otherwise our historical exercise experience is used to determine the exercise threshold zero coupon yield implied by treasury issuance implied volatility for our common stock and our historical forfeiture rate are other input to the binomial model unanticipated event and circumstance may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumption estimate or actual result goodwill impairmentwe complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis during the second quarter of our fiscal year or more frequently if change in fact and circumstance indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we typically estimate future revenue consider market factor and estimate our future cash flow based on these key assumption judgment and estimate we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to it estimated fair value assumption judgment and estimate about future value are complex and often subjective they can be affected by variety of factor including external factor such industry and economic trend and internal factor such change in our business strategy or our internal forecast although we believe the assumption judgment and estimate we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate different assumption judgment and estimate could materially affect our reported financial result we completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal and determined there wa no impairment the result of our annual impairment test indicate there is no significant risk of future material goodwill impairment in any of our reporting unit accounting for income taxeswe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income tax under this method income tax expense is recognized for the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year in addition deferred tax asset and liability are recognized for the expected future tax consequence of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards management must make assumption judgment and estimate to determine our current provision for income tax and also our deferred tax asset and liability and any valuation allowance to be recorded against deferred tax asset our assumption judgment and estimate relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax law our interpretation of current tax law and possible outcome of current and future audit conducted by foreign and domestic of contentstax authority we have established reserve for income tax to address potential exposure involving tax position that could be challenged by tax authority in addition we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax return by the irs and other domestic and foreign tax authority including current examination by the irs of our fiscal and tax return we expect future examination to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practice well other matter we regularly ass the likelihood of outcome resulting from these examination to determine the adequacy of our provision for income tax and have reserved for potential adjustment that may result from the current examination we believe such estimate to be reasonable however the final determination of any of these examination could significantly impact the amount provided for income tax in our consolidated financial statement our assumption judgment and estimate relative to the value of deferred tax asset take into account prediction of the amount and category of future taxable income such income from operation or capital gain income actual operating result and the underlying amount and category of income in future year could render our current assumption judgment and estimate of recoverable net deferred tax inaccurate any of the assumption judgment and estimate mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligation to differ from our estimate thus materially impacting our financial position and result of operation we are united state based multinational company subject to tax in multiple and foreign tax jurisdiction significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our irish subsidiary in addition to providing for income tax on earnings from the we provide for income tax on the earnings of foreign subsidiary unless the subsidiary earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings if certain foreign earnings previously treated permanently reinvested are repatriated the related tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income tax paid on these earnings our income tax expense ha differed from the tax computed at the federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete item and to earnings considered permanently reinvested in foreign operation unanticipated change in our tax rate could affect our future result of operation our future effective tax rate could be unfavorably affected by change in the tax rate in jurisdiction where our income is earned by change in or our interpretation of tax rule and regulation in the jurisdiction in which we do business by unanticipated decrease in the amount of earnings in country with low statutory tax rate by lapse of the availability of the research and development tax credit or by change in the valuation of our deferred tax asset and liability the united state country in the european union and other country where we do business have been considering change in relevant tax accounting and other law regulation and interpretation including change to tax law applicable to corporate multinationals such adobe these potential change could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in other cost to recent accounting pronouncement not yet effectiveon may the fasb issued asu no revenue from contract with customer requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised good or service to customer the updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in gaap when it becomes effective and permit the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method early adoption is not permitted the updated standard becomes effective for in the first quarter of fiscal we have not yet selected transition method and we are currently evaluating the effect

perpetual licensee in the first half of fiscal we announced the removal of general availability of on perpetual licensing basis from legacy shrinkwrap and volume licensing channel we still offer through our adobe com website and in certain market because of the shift towards creative cloud subscription and etlas perpetual revenue for ha declined and by the fourth quarter of fiscal revenue from perpetual licensing of our creative professional product wa immaterial during fiscal we continued to experience strong adoption of our creative cloud subscription offering which ha caused our creative cloud subscription revenue to increase compared to the year ago period to assist with an understanding of this transition we are using certain performance metric to ass the health and trajectory of our overall digital medium segment these metric include the total number of current paid subscription and annualized recurring revenue arr arr should be viewed independently of revenue deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue arr is performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these item we plan to adjust our reported arr on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rate change for our creative business we define creative arr the sum of the number of current subscription multiplied by the average subscription price paid per user per month multiplied by twelve month plus twelve month of contract value of etlas where the revenue is ratably recognized over the life of the contract plus twelve month of adobe digital publishing suite contract value where the revenue is ratably recognized we exited fiscal with million paid creative cloud subscription up from million at the end of fiscal total creative arr exiting fiscal wa billion

marketing cloud solution including solid growth of our adobe experience manager aem and adobe campaign offering aem and adobe campaign have historically been licensed by our customer on premise offering where license revenue ha been recognized at the time of the transaction during fiscal we saw increased customer adoption of term based licensing of contentsof our aem and adobe campaign solution where revenue is booked and recognized ratably we believe this is resulting in larger customer engagement more predictable revenue well higher long term revenue growth in evaluating our adobe marketing cloud revenue performance we believe it is important to understand this licensing and revenue mix shift that is occurring with aem and adobe campaign in fiscal approximately of our aem and adobe campaign contract were term based entering fiscal based on our goal of migrating more of these solution to be term based we expected mix of approximately term based contract for aem and adobe

extent new contract and existing contract renewal for our adobe marketing cloud service contributed to this increase our retention rate for adobe marketing cloud service have been improving slightly over time cost of revenue of million increased by million or during fiscal from million in fiscal and million or during fiscal from million in fiscal these increase were primarily due to increased

revenue represents expected future billing which are contractually committed under our existing subscription saas and managed service agreement that have not been invoiced and are not recorded in

backlog of approximately billion of which approximately to is not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal of november we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately billion of

managed service agreement varying billing cycle of these agreement the timing of customer renewal the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue backlog is to be billed change in customer financial circumstance and foreign currency fluctuation additionally the unbilled deferred revenue backlog for multi year subscription agreement that are billed annually is typically higher at the beginning of

increased by approximately seven percentage point during fiscal compared to fiscal the increase wa primarily due to the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit in december and stronger domestic profit for fiscal our effective tax rate decreased by approximately seven percentage point during fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily related to the reinstatement of the research and development credit and tax benefit recognized result of the completion of certain income tax examination in december the united state congress passed an extension of the federal

classification of current and non current asset and liability we believe that within the next month it is reasonably possible that either certain audit will conclude or statute of limitation on certain income tax examination period will expire or both given the uncertainty described above we can only determine range of estimated potential decrease in underlying unrecognized tax benefit ranging from to approximately million royaltieswe have certain royalty commitment associated with the shipment and licensing of certain product royalty expense is generally based on dollar amount per

counterparties in these contract expose to credit related loss in the event of their nonperformance however to mitigate that risk we only contract with counterparties who meet our minimum requirement under our counterparty risk assessment process in addition our hedging policy establishes maximum limit for each counterparty sensitivity analysis wa performed on all of our foreign exchange derivative of november this sensitivity analysis measure the hypothetical market value resulting from shift in the value of exchange rate relative to the dollar for option contract the black scholes

financial hedging instrument by million conversely decrease in the value of the dollar would result in decrease in the fair value of these financial instrument by million general rule we do not use foreign exchange contract to hedge local currency denominated operating expense in country where natural hedge exists for example in many country revenue in the local currency substantially offset the local currency denominated operating expense we also have long term investment exposure consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non dollar functional currency foreign subsidiary of november and november this long term investment exposure totaled notional equivalent of million and million respectively at this time we do not hedge these long term investment exposure we do not use foreign exchange contract for speculative trading purpose nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in manner that entirely offset the effect of change in foreign exchange rate we regularly

exchange contract to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly they are not speculative in nature we record change in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedge in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs when the forecasted transaction occurs we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue in the

software upgrade maintenance and support hosted service and consulting for our software and software related multiple element arrangement we must determine whether and when each element ha been delivered determine whether undelivered product or service are essential to the functionality of the delivered product and service determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe and allocate the total price among the various element vsoe of fair value is used to allocate portion of the price to the undelivered element and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered element absent vsoe revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all element of the arrangement have been delivered however if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period change in assumption or judgment or change to the element in software arrangement could cause material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in particular period we determine vsoe for each element based on historical stand alone sale to third party or from the stated renewal rate for the element contained in the initial arrangement in determining vsoe we require that
