reasonably possible that any amount we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceeding in excess of our reserve of december will have material effect on our financial statement if we do not or can not adequately protect our intellectual property or if third party infringe our intellectual property right we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resource enforcing our right many of the market we serve are technology driven and result intellectual property right play significant role in product development and differentiation we

intellectual property right that we obtain however may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide significant competitive advantage and patent may not be issued for pending or future patent application owned by or licensed to in addition the step that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented designed around or becoming subject to compulsory licensing particularly in country where intellectual property right are not highly developed or protected in some circumstance enforcement may not be available to because an infringer ha dominant intellectual property position or for other business reason or country may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreement with employee consultant and other party to protect in part trade secret and other proprietary right there can be no assurance that these agreement will adequately protect our trade secret and other proprietary right and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedy for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third party will not otherwise gain access to our trade secret or other proprietary right our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property right that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property right could adversely impact our business including our competitive position and financial statement party may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property right and we could suffer significant litigation expense loss or licensing expense or be prevented from selling product or service from time to time we receive notice from third party alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time consuming due to the complexity of many of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting counterclaim or negotiating license in response to claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition result of such claim of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our right to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical product and service be required to pay substantial damage or license fee with respect to the infringed right or be required to redesign our product at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our business including our competitive position and financial statement even if we successfully defend against claim of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant cost

source from third party can lead to personal injury death property damage loss of profit or other liability these event could lead to recall or safety alert result in the removal of product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claim being brought against recall removal and product liability and similar claim regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome can result in significant cost well negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our product and service our business can also be affected by study of the utilization safety and efficacy of medical device product and component that are conducted by industry participant government agency and others any of the above can result in the discontinuation of marketing of such product in one or more country and may give rise to claim for damage from person who believe they have been injured result of product issue including claim by individual or group seeking to represent class the manufacture of many of our product is highly exacting and complex process and if we directly or indirectly encounter problem manufacturing product our reputation business and financial statement could suffer the manufacture of many of our product is highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirement problem may arise during manufacturing for variety of reason including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocol and procedure problem with raw material natural disaster and environmental factor and if not discovered before the product is released to market could result in recall and product liability exposure because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facility and other stringent regulation of the fda and similar agency regarding the manufacture of certain of our product an alternative manufacturer may not be available on timely basis to replace such production capacity any of these manufacturing problem could result in significant cost liability and lost revenue loss of market share well negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our product our indebtedness may limit our operation and our use of our cash flow and any failure to comply with the covenant that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statement of december we had approximately billion in outstanding indebtedness in addition of december we had the ability to incur approximately an additional billion of indebtedness in direct borrowing or under the outstanding commercial paper facility based on the amount available under the company billion credit facility which not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balance our debt level and related debt service obligation can have negative consequence including requiring to dedicate significant cash flow from operation to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the fund we have available for other purpose such acquisition and capital investment reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to change in our business and market condition and exposing to interest rate risk since portion of our debt obligation are at variable rate we may incur significantly more debt in the future particularly to finance acquisition and there can be no assurance that our cost of funding will not substantially increase our current revolving credit facility and long term debt obligation also impose certain restriction on for more information refer to md if we breach any of these restriction and can not obtain waiver from the lender on favorable term subject to applicable cure period the outstanding indebtedness and any other indebtedness with cross default provision could be declared immediately due and payable which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial statement in addition any failure to maintain the credit rating assigned to by independent rating agency would adversely affect our cost of fund and could adversely affect our liquidity and access to the capital market if we add new debt the risk described above could increase adverse change in our relationship with or the financial condition performance purchasing pattern or inventory level of key distributor and other channel partner could adversely affect our financial statement certain of our business sell significant amount of their product to or through key distributor and other channel partner that have valuable relationship with customer and end user some of these distributor and other partner also sell our competitor product or compete with directly and if they favor competing product for any reason they may fail to market our product effectively adverse change in our relationship with these distributor and other partner reduction or discontinuation of their purchase from or adverse development in their financial condition performance or purchasing pattern could adversely affect our business and financial statement the level of inventory maintained by our distributor and other channel partner and change in those level can also significantly impact our result of operation in any given period in addition the consolidation of distributor and customer in certain of our served industry could adversely impact our business and financial statement certain of our business rely on relationship with collaborative partner and other third party for development supply and marketing of certain product and potential product and such collaborative partner or other third party could fail to perform sufficiently we believe that for certain of our business success in penetrating target market depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationship with other company relying on collaborative relationship is risky because among other thing our collaborative partner may not devote sufficient resource to the success of our collaboration fail to obtain regulatory approval necessary to continue the collaboration in timely manner be acquired by other company and terminate our collaborative partnership or become insolvent compete with disagree with on key detail of the collaborative relationship have insufficient capital resource and decline to renew existing collaboration on acceptable term because these and other factor may be beyond our control the development or commercialization of our product involved in collaborative partnership may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected if we or any of our collaborative partner terminate collaborative arrangement we may be required to devote additional resource to product development and commercialization or we may need to cancel some development program which could adversely affect our business and financial statement our financial result are subject to fluctuation in the cost and availability of commodity that we use in our operation discussed in item business material our manufacturing and other operation employ wide variety of component raw material and other commodity including metallic based component electronic component chemical plastic and other petroleum based product price for and availability of these component raw material and other commodity have fluctuated significantly in the past any sustained interruption in the supply of these item could adversely affect our business in addition due to the highly competitive nature of the industry that we serve the cost containment effort of our customer and the term of certain contract we are party to if commodity price rise we may be unable to pas along cost increase through higher price if we are unable to fully recover higher commodity cost through price increase or offset these increase through cost reduction or if there is time delay between the increase in cost and our ability to recover or offset these cost our margin and profitability could decline and our financial statement could be adversely affected we can not adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchase required for our manufacturing activity to reflect change in market condition and customer demand our profitability may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole or limited source of supply for certain material component and service could cause production interruption delay and inefficiency we purchase material component and equipment from third party for use in our manufacturing operation including metallic based component electronic component chemical plastic and other petroleum based product our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchase to reflect change in customer demand and market fluctuation including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during market upturn supplier may extend lead time limit supply or increase price if we can not purchase sufficient product at competitive price and quality and on timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipment may be delayed our cost may increase or we may breach our contractual commitment and incur liability conversely in order to secure supply for the production of product we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitment with vendor which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demand if demand for our product is le than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventory and be forced to incur additional charge and our profitability may suffer in addition some of our business purchase certain requirement from sole or limited source supplier for reason of quality assurance regulatory requirement cost effectiveness availability or uniqueness of design if these or other supplier encounter financial operating or other difficulty or if our relationship with them change we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement source of supply the supply chain for our business could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraint bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reason decreased availability of key raw material or commodity and external event such natural disaster pandemic health issue war terrorist action governmental action and legislative or regulatory change any of these factor could result in production interruption delay extended lead time and inefficiency because we can not always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structure to changing market condition our manufacturing capacity may at time exceed or fall short of our production requirement any or all of these problem could result in the loss of customer provide an opportunity for competing product to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our financial statement change in governmental regulation may reduce demand for our product or service or increase our expense we compete in market in which we and our customer must comply with supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional regulation such regulation governing health and safety the environment food and drug privacy and electronic communication we develop configure and market our product and service to meet customer need created by these regulation these regulation are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdiction any significant change in any of these regulation or in the interpretation or application thereof could reduce demand for increase our cost of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified product and service or could restrict our existing activity product and service for example number of our product and service are marketed to the pharmaceutical and related industry for use in discovering and developing drug and therapy change in the fda regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these product and service in addition in certain of our market our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulation in these market the delay or failure of governmental and other entity to adopt or enforce new regulation the adoption of new regulation which our product and service are not positioned to address or the repeal of existing regulation could adversely affect demand in addition regulatory deadline may result in substantially different level of demand for our product and service from period to period work stoppage union and work council campaign and other labor dispute could adversely impact our productivity and result of operation we have certain and non collective labor arrangement we are subject to potential work stoppage union and work council campaign and other labor dispute any of which could adversely impact our financial statement and business including our productivity and reputation economic political legal compliance and business factor could negatively affect our financial statement in approximately of our sale were derived from customer outside the united state in addition many of our manufacturing operation supplier and employee are located outside the united state since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate market outside the united state and increase the localization of our product and service we expect to continue to increase our sale and presence outside the united state particularly in the high growth market our international business and particularly our business in high growth market is subject to risk that are customarily encountered in non operation including interruption in the transportation of material to and finished good to our customer difference in term of sale including payment term local product preference and product requirement change in country or region political or economic condition such the devaluation of particular currency trade protection measure embargo and import or export restriction and requirement unexpected change in law or regulatory requirement including change in tax law capital control and limitation on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash the potential for nationalization of enterprise change in medical reimbursement policy and program limitation on legal right and our ability to enforce such right difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operation differing labor regulation difficulty in implementing restructuring action on timely or comprehensive basis differing protection of intellectual property and greater uncertainty risk expense and delay in commercializing product in certain foreign jurisdiction including with respect to product and other regulatory approval any of these risk could negatively affect our financial statement and business including our growth rate significant development stemming from the united kingdom

to depart the eu on march but the term of it withdrawal and the nature of it future relationship with the eu are still being decided this referendum ha caused and may continue to cause political and

eu member unanimously agree on an extension negotiation have commenced to determine the future term of the uk relationship with the eu including among other thing the term of trade between the uk and the eu if no agreement is reached by march the uk membership in the eu could terminate under so called hard brexit the effect of brexit will depend on many factor including any agreement that the uk make to retain access to eu market either during transitional period or more permanently brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national law and regulation the uk determines which eu law to replace or replicate in hard brexit scenario there could be increased cost from re imposition of tariff on trade between the uk and eu shipping delay because of the need for custom inspection and procedure and temporary shortage of certain good in addition trade and investment between the uk the eu the united state and other country will be impacted by the fact that the uk currently operates under the eu tax treaty the uk will need to negotiate it own tax and trade treaty with country all over the world which could take year to complete we have manufacturing facility in the uk and depending on the term of brexit we could become subject to export tariff and regulatory restriction that could increase the cost and time related to doing business in europe additionally brexit could result in the uk or the european union significantly altering it regulation affecting the clearance or approval of our product are developed or manufactured in the uk any new regulation could add time and expense to the conduct of our business well the process by which our product receive regulatory approval in the uk the eu and elsewhere any of these factor could adversely affect customer demand our relationship with customer and supplier and our business and financial statement of december the company net investment in plant property and equipment in the uk wa million for the

information technology system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood earthquake hurricane public health crisis war terrorism or other natural or man made disaster such the damage caused to our facility by hurricane maria in puerto rico in september if any of these facility supply chain or system were to experience catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operation delay production and shipment result in defective product or service damage customer relationship and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expense the third party insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decision regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect against such loss our defined benefit pension plan are subject to financial market risk that could adversely affect our financial statement the performance of the financial market and interest rate impact our defined benefit pension plan expense and funding obligation significant change in market interest rate decrease in the fair value of plan asset investment loss on plan asset and change in discount

may have on it operating profit whole interest rate riskthe company manages interest cost using mixture of fixed rate and variable rate debt change in interest rate on long term debt impact the fair value of the company fixed rate long term debt but not the company earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixed rate debt will increase interest rate fall and decrease interest rate rise of december an increase of basis point in interest rate would have decreased the fair value of the company fixed rate long term debt excluding the lyon which have not been included in this calculation the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from the value of it underlying common stock by million of december the company variable rate debt obligation consisted primarily of dollar and euro based commercial paper borrowing refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for information regarding the company outstanding

statement which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state the preparation of these financial statement requires management to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent asset and liability the company base these estimate and judgment on historical experience the current economic environment and on various other assumption that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance actual result may differ materially from these estimate and judgment the company belief the following accounting estimate are most critical to an understanding of it financial statement estimate are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criterion the estimate requires assumption about material matter that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and material change in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to period for detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimate refer to note to the consolidated financial statement acquired intangible the company business acquisition typically result in the recognition of goodwill in process and other intangible asset which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charge that the company may incur refer to note and to the consolidated financial statement for description of the company policy relating to goodwill acquired intangible and acquisition in performing it goodwill impairment testing the company estimate the fair value of it reporting unit primarily using market based approach in evaluating the estimate derived by the market based approach management make judgment about the relevance and reliability of the multiple by considering factor unique to it reporting unit including operating result business plan economic projection anticipated future cash flow and transaction and marketplace data well judgment about the comparability of the market proxy selected in certain circumstance the company also estimate fair value utilizing discounted cash flow analysis an income approach in order to validate the result of the market approach the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumption about projected revenue growth future operating margin discount rate and terminal value there are inherent uncertainty related to these assumption and management judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment of december the company had eight reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing reporting unit resulting from recent acquisition generally present the highest risk of impairment management belief the impairment risk associated with these reporting unit generally decrease these business are integrated into the company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth the company annual goodwill impairment analysis in indicated that in all instance the fair value of the company reporting unit exceeded their carrying value and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company reporting unit of the annual testing date ranged from approximately to approximately in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculation used in the goodwill impairment test the company applied hypothetical decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical value to the reporting unit carrying value based on this hypothetical decrease the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company reporting unit ranged from approximately to approximately the company review identified intangible asset for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable the company also test intangible asset with indefinite life at least annually for impairment determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flow expected to be generated by the asset these analysis require management to make judgment and estimate about future revenue expense market condition and discount rate related to these asset if actual result are not consistent with management estimate and assumption goodwill and other intangible asset may be overstated and charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the company consolidated financial statement historically the company estimate of goodwill and intangible asset have been materially correct contingent liability discussed in item legal proceeding and note to the consolidated financial statement the company is from time to time subject to variety of litigation and similar contingent liability incidental to it business or the business operation of previously owned entity the company recognizes liability for any legal contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessment require judgment concerning matter such litigation development and outcome the anticipated outcome of

to various factor including those discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement if of contentsthe reserve established by the company with respect to these contingent liability are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserve which would adversely affect the company financial statement revenue
