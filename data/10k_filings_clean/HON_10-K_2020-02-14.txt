important competitive factor for our product and service and there is considerable price competition other competitive factor include breadth of product line research and development effort and technical and managerial capability while our competitive position varies among our product and service we believe we are significant competitor in each of our major product and service class many of our competitor have substantial financial resource and significant technological capability in addition some of our product compete with the captive component division of oems government salessales to the government principally by aerospace acting through it various department and agency and through prime contractor amounted to million million and million in and which included sale to the department of defense prime contractor and subcontractor of million million and million in and we not expect our overall operating result to be significantly affected by any proposed change in federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the government program which impact oems production engineering development program aftermarket spare and repair and overhaul program well our diversified commercial business operationswe engage in manufacturing sale service and research and development globally export and non manufactured product are significant to our operation export comprised of our total sale in in and in non manufactured product and service mainly in europe and asia were of our total sale in in and in manufactured product and system andperformance of service year ended december honeywellbuildingtechnologies performancematerials andtechnologies safety andproductivitysolutions of segment sale export non manufactured service information related to risk attendant to our foreign operation is included in item risk factor under the caption macroeconomic and industry risk backlogour backlog represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contract backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligation under the contract that meet the guidance on revenue from contract with customer discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement backlog wa million and million at december and we expect to recognize approximately of our remaining performance obligation revenue in and the remaining balance thereafter raw materialsthe principal raw material used in our operation are readily available although we occasionally experience disruption in raw material supply we experienced no significant problem in the purchase of key raw material or commodity in we are not dependent on any one supplier for material amount of our raw material price of certain key raw material including copper fluorspar tungsten salt ethylene aluminum and molybdenum in performance material and technology and nickel steel titanium and other metal in aerospace are expected to fluctuate we offset raw material cost increase with formula or long term supply agreement price increase and hedging activity feasible we do not presently anticipate that shortage of raw material will cause any material adverse impact during patent trademark license and distribution rightsour segment are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patent or any license or distribution right in our judgment our intellectual property right are adequate for the conduct of our business we believe that in the aggregate the right under our patent trademark and license are generally important to our operation but we do not consider any individual patent trademark or any licensing or distribution right related to specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirement regarding protection of human health and the environment our policy practice and procedure are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with our business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of our operation and product it is with other company engaged in similar business we engage in the handling manufacturing use and disposal of many substance classified hazardous by one or more regulatory agency our policy practice and procedure are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of these substance meet or exceed environmental and safety law and regulation it is possible that future knowledge or other development such improved capability to detect substance in the environment or increasingly strict environmental law and standard and enforcement policy could bring into question our current or past handling manufacture use or disposal of these substance among other environmental requirement we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign law and regulation under which we have been designated potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup cost associated with current and former operating site and various hazardous waste site some of which are on the environmental protection agency national priority list while there is possibility that responsible party might be unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible party we do not anticipate to bear significantly more our proportional share in multi party situation taken whole we do not believe that federal state and local provision regulating the discharge of material into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment or any existing or pending climate change legislation regulation or international treaty or accord are reasonably likely to have material effect in the foreseeable future on the company business we will continue to monitor emerging development in this area employeeswe

that drive our business and future result in item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation and in other part of this report including this item such discussion contain forward looking statement within the meaning of section of the security exchange act of forward looking statement are those that address activity event or development that management intends expects project belief or anticipates will or may occur in the future they are based on management assumption and assessment in light of past experience and trend current economic and industry condition expected future development and other relevant factor they are not guarantee of future performance and actual result development and business decision may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward looking statement we do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward looking statement our forward looking statement are also subject to risk and uncertainty that can affect our performance in both the near and long term these forward looking statement be considered in light of the information included in this form including in particular the factor discussed below these factor may be revised or supplemented in subsequent report on form and factorsour business operating result cash flow and financial condition are subject to the principal risk and uncertainty set forth below any one of which could cause our actual result to vary materially from recent result or from our anticipated future result macroeconomic and industry riskseach of our business is subject to unique industry and economic condition that may adversely affect the market and operating condition of our customer which in turn can affect demand for our product and service and our result of operation aerospace our aerospace business is impacted by customer buying pattern of aftermarket part supplier stability factory transition and global supply chain capacity constraint that may lead to shortage of crucial component operating result may be adversely affected by downturn in the global demand for air travel which impact new aircraft production or the delay or cancellation of new aircraft order delay in launch schedule for new aircraft the retirement of aircraft and global flying hour which impact air transport regional business and general aviation aircraft utilization rate operating result may be adversely affected by the decrease in air travel demand due to regional restriction or suspension of service for public health safety or environmental event operating result could also be impacted by change in overall trend related to end market demand for the product portfolio well new entrant and non traditional player entering the market operating result in our defense and space business unit may be affected by the mix of and foreign government appropriation for defense and space program and by compliance risk result may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit part into our global supply chain honeywell building technology operating result may be adversely impacted by downturn in the level of global commercial construction activity including retrofit and upgrade lower capital spending and operating expenditure on building project le industrial plant expansion change in the competitive landscape including new market entrant and new technology and fluctuation in inventory level in distribution channel performance material and technology operating result may be adversely impacted by downturn in capacity utilization for chemical industrial refining petrochemical and semiconductor plant our customer availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion raw material demand and supply volatility product commoditization continued illegal import of hydrofluorocarbon into europe and our ability to maximize our facility production capacity and minimize downtime in particular the volatility in oil and natural gas price have and will continue to impact our customer operating level and capital spending and thus demand for our product and service safety and productivity solution operating result may be adversely impacted by reduced investment in process automation safety monitoring and plant capacity utilization initiative fluctuation in retail market lower customer demand due to the failure to anticipate and respond to overall trend related to end market demand change in the competitive landscape including new market entrant and technology that may lead to product commoditization and adverse industry economic condition all of which could result in lower market share reduced selling price and lower margin an increasing percentage of our sale and operation is in non jurisdiction and is subject to the economic political regulatory foreign exchange and other risk of international operation our international operation including export represent more than half of the company sale risk related to international operation include exchange control regulation wage and price control antitrust regulation employment regulation foreign investment law import export and other trade restriction such sanction and embargo differing level of protection of intellectual property act of industrial espionage violation by our employee of anti corruption law despite our effort to mitigate these risk change in regulation regarding transaction with state owned enterprise nationalization of private enterprise act of terrorism and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employee in these region instability and uncertainty arising from the global geopolitical environment and the evolving international and domestic political regulatory and economic landscape the potential for change in global trade policy including sanction and trade barrier trend such populism economic nationalism and negative sentiment toward multinational company and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulation worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategy for growing our business well our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margin there is uncertainty regarding the final outcome and full term of the united kingdom future relationship with the european union it is possible that there will be greater restriction on import and export between the united kingdom and other country including the united state increased tariff on import and export and increased regulatory complexity the company ha developed plan to mitigate the potential impact of these possible restriction but the implication of these uncertainty could affect the company business financial position and result of operation existing free trade law and regulation provide certain beneficial duty and tariff for qualifying import and export change in law or policy governing the term of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restriction tariff or tax on import from country where we manufacture product or from where we import product or raw material either directly or through our supplier could have an impact on our competitive position and financial result the united state ha commenced certain trade action including imposing tariff on certain good imported from china and other country which ha resulted in retaliatory tariff by china and other country additional tariff imposed by the united state on broader range of import or further retaliatory trade measure taken by china or other country in response could increase the cost of our product operating outside of the united state also expose to foreign exchange risk which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activity however foreign exchange hedging activity bear financial cost and may not always be available to or be successful in eliminating such volatility finally we generate significant amount of cash outside of the united state that is invested with financial and non financial counterparties while we employ comprehensive control regarding global cash management to guard cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operation and commitment material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose honeywell to financial loss operating outside the united state also expose to additional intellectual property risk the law and enforcement practice of certain jurisdiction in which we operate may not protect our intellectual property right to the extent in the and may impose joint venture technology transfer local service or other foreign investment requirement and restriction that potentially compromise control over our technology and proprietary information failure of foreign jurisdiction to protect our intellectual property right an inability to effectively enforce such right in foreign jurisdiction or the imposition of foreign jurisdiction investment or sourcing restriction or requirement could result in loss of valuable proprietary information and could impact our competitive position and financial result risk related to our defined benefit pension plan may adversely impact our result of operation and cash flow significant change in actual investment return on pension asset discount rate and other factor could adversely affect our result of operation and require cash pension contribution in future period change in discount rate and actual asset return different than our anticipated asset return can result in significant non cash actuarial gain or loss which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and if applicable in any quarter in which an interim measurement is triggered with regard to cash pension contribution funding requirement for our pension plan are largely dependent upon interest rate actual investment return on pension asset and the impact of legislative or regulatory change related to pension funding obligation we may be required to transition from the use of the libor interest rate index in the future we have certain contract indexed to libor to calculate the interest rate the continued availability of the libor index is not guaranteed after we can not predict whether and to extent bank will continue to provide libor submission to the administrator of libor or whether any additional reform to libor may be enacted the language in certain of our libor based contract identify various event that trigger when successor rate to the designated rate would be selected if trigger is satisfied such contract may give the calculation agent discretion over the substitute index or index for the calculation of interest rate to be selected the implementation of substitute index or index for the calculation of interest rate under our contract may result in our incurring significant expense in effecting the transition and may result in dispute or litigation over the appropriateness or comparability to libor of the substitute index or index which could have an adverse effect on our result of operation risksraw material price fluctuation the ability of key supplier to meet quality and delivery requirement or catastrophic event can increase the cost of our product and service impact our ability to meet commitment to customer and cause to incur significant liability the cost of raw material is key element in the cost of our product particularly in performance material and technology copper fluorspar tungsten salt ethylene aluminum and molybdenum and in aerospace nickel steel titanium and other metal our inability to offset material price inflation through increased price to customer formula or long term fixed price contract with supplier productivity action or through commodity hedge could adversely affect our result of operation many major component product equipment item and raw material particularly in aerospace are procured or subcontracted on single or sole source basis although we maintain qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that source of supply for raw material and component are generally adequate it is difficult to predict what effect shortage or price increase may have in the future our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirement may be constrained by our supplier inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long lead time product during time of volatile demand our inability to fill our supply need would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligation under commercial and government contract which could in turn result in reduced sale and profit contract penalty or termination and damage to customer relationship we may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisition and divestiture may not occur planned we regularly review our portfolio of business and pursue growth through acquisition and seek to divest non core business we may not be able to complete transaction on favorable term on timely basis or at all in addition our result of operation and cash flow may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired business to meet or exceed expected return including risk of impairment ii the failure to integrate multiple acquired business into honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and or to achieve expected synergy iii the inability to dispose of non core asset and business on satisfactory term and condition and iv the discovery of unanticipated liability labor relation difficulty cybersecurity concern compliance issue or other problem in acquired business for which we lack contractual protection insurance or indemnity or with regard to divested business claim by purchaser to whom we have provided contractual indemnification our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technology and introduce new product that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive market with acceptable margin our future growth rate depends upon number of factor including our ability to identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trend in our target end market ii develop and maintain competitive product iii defend our market share against an ever expanding number of competitor including many new and non traditional competitor iv enhance our product by adding innovative feature that differentiate our product from those of our competitor and prevent commoditization of our product develop manufacture and bring compelling new product to market quickly and cost effectively vi monitor disruptive technology and business model vii achieve sufficient return on investment for new product introduced based on capital expenditure and research and development spending viii respond to change in overall trend related to end market demand and ix attract develop and retain individual with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customer need to develop new technology and introduce new product competitor may also develop after market service and part for our product which attract customer and adversely affect our return on investment for new product the failure of our technology or product to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offering by our competitor or the failure to address any of the factor could significantly reduce our revenue and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospect to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvement well an inability to successfully execute repositioning project or to effectively manage our workforce may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our business our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvement in addition we seek productivity and cost saving benefit through repositioning action and project such consolidation of manufacturing facility transition to cost competitive region and product line rationalization risk associated with these action include delay in execution additional unexpected cost realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvement and adverse effect on employee morale we may not realize the full operational or financial benefit we expect the recognition of these benefit may be delayed and these action may potentially disrupt our operation in addition organizational change increased attrition failure to create and implement succession plan for key company position not retaining key talent inability to attract new employee with unique skill labor relation difficulty or workforce stoppage could have material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and result

instrument and fair value measure of note to consolidated financial statement for further discussion on the agreement accounting estimatesthe preparation of our consolidated financial statement in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle is based on the selection and application of accounting policy that require to make significant estimate and assumption about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain many estimate and assumption involved in the application of accounting principle have material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and on the comparability of such reported information over different reporting period critical accounting estimate or assumption are those where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matter or the susceptibility of such matter to change and the impact of the estimate and assumption on financial condition or operating performance is material we consider the estimate and assumption discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statement actual result could differ from our estimate and assumption and any such difference could be material to our consolidated financial statement contingent liability we are subject to number of lawsuit investigation and claim some of which involve substantial dollar amount that arise out of the conduct of our global business operation or those of previously owned entity including matter relating to commercial transaction

of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other expert such analysis includes making judgment concerning matter such the cost associated with environmental matter the outcome of negotiation the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claim and the impact of evidentiary requirement because most contingency are resolved over long period of time liability may change in the future due to new development including new discovery of fact change in legislation and outcome of similar case through the judicial system change in assumption or change in our settlement strategy see note commitment and contingency of note to consolidated financial statement for discussion of management judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liability which represent our most significant contingency asbestos related liability and insurance recovery in connection with the recognition of liability for asbestos related matter we record asbestos related insurance recovery that are deemed probable in assessing the probability of insurance recovery we make judgment concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealing and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issue surrounding insurer while the substantial majority of our insurance carrier are solvent some of our individual carrier are insolvent which ha been considered in our analysis of probable recovery projecting future event is subject to various uncertainty that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liability to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded given the inherent uncertainty in making future projection we reevaluate our projection concerning our probable insurance recovery considering any change to the projected liability our recovery experience or other relevant factor that may impact future insurance recovery our involvement in asbestos related personal injury action relates to two predecessor company regarding north american refractory company narco asbestos related claim we accrue for pending claim based on term and condition in agreement with narco it former parent company and certain asbestos claimant and an estimate of the unsettled claim pending of the time narco filed for bankruptcy protection we also accrue for the estimated value of future narco asbestos related claim expected to be asserted against the narco trust the estimate of future narco claim wa prepared in in the same year narco filed for bankruptcy protection using narco tort system litigation experience based on commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy court addressing trust accordingly the estimated value of future narco asbestos claim wa prepared before there wa data on claim filing and payment rate in the narco trust under the trust distribution procedure and prepared when the stay of all narco asbestos claim wa in effect which remained in effect until narco emerged from bankruptcy protection some critical assumption underlying this commonly accepted methodology included claim filing rate disease criterion and payment value contained in the trust distribution procedure estimated approval rate of claim submitted to the narco trust and epidemiological study estimating disease instance this estimate resulted in range of estimated liability of million to million we believe that no amount within this range is better estimate than any other amount and accordingly we have recorded the minimum amount in the range given the trust lack of sufficiently reliable claim data since narco emerged from bankruptcy protection it is not yet possible to update our estimated future claim cost based on actual narco trust experience when sufficiently reliable claim data exists we will update our estimate of the narco trust liability and it is possible that material change may need to be recognized regarding bendix friction material bendix asbestos related claim we accrued for the estimated value of pending claim using average resolution value for the previous year we also accrued for the estimated value of future claim related to bendix over the full term of epidemiological projection through based on historic and anticipated claim filing experience and dismissal rate disease classification and average resolution value in the tort system for the previous five year see note commitment and contingency of note to consolidated financial statement for discussion of management judgment applied in the

reporting purpose net periodic pension income expense is calculated annually based upon number of actuarial assumption including discount rate for plan obligation and an expected long term rate of return on plan asset change in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan asset could materially affect the annual pension income expense amount annual pension income expense is comprised of service and interest cost assumed return on plan asset prior service amortization pension ongoing income expense and potential mark to market adjustment mtm adjustment the key assumption used in developing our and net periodic pension income expense for our plan included the following rate projected benefit service interest asset expected rate of actual rate of actual year average annual compounded rate of the mtm adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gain or loss in excess of of the greater of the fair value of plan asset or the plan projected benefit obligation the corridor net actuarial gain and loss occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumption used to value our pension plan or when assumption change the primary factor contributing to actuarial gain and loss are change in the discount rate used to value pension obligation of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual return on plan asset the mark to market accounting method result in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast mtm adjustment mtm charge were million million and million in and we determine the expected long term rate of return on plan asset utilizing historical plan asset return over varying long term period combined with our expectation of future market condition and asset mix consideration see note pension and other postretirement benefit of note to consolidated financial statement for detail on the actual various asset class and targeted asset allocation percentage for our pension plan we plan to use an expected rate of return on plan asset of for from for reflecting decline in interest rate and additional re balancing of asset to more fixed income the discount rate reflects the market rate on december measurement date for high quality fixed income investment with maturity corresponding to our benefit obligation and is subject to change each year the discount rate can be volatile from year to year it is determined based upon prevailing interest rate of the measurement date we used discount rate to determine benefit obligation of december reflecting decrease in the market interest rate environment since the prior year end addition to the potential for mtm adjustment change in our expected rate of return on plan asset and discount rate resulting from economic event also affect future pension ongoing income expense the following table highlight the sensitivity of our pension obligation and ongoing income expense to change in these assumption assuming all other assumption remain constant these estimate exclude any potential mtm adjustment change in assumptionimpact on ongoingexpense impact on percentage point decrease in discount

increase in expected rate of return on assetsdecrease million pension ongoing income for our world wide pension plan is expected to be approximately million in compared with pension ongoing income of million in the expected increase in pension income is primarily due to lower interest cost from decrease in discount rate in our and uk plan and higher expected return on plan asset lower rate of return on higher asset base also if required an mtm adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of in accordance with our pension accounting method previously described it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be mtm adjustment in and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be mtm adjustment are primarily driven by event and circumstance beyond the control of the company such change in interest rate and the performance of the financial market finite lived intangible asset the determination of useful life for depreciation amortization purpose and whether or not intangible asset are impaired involves the use of accounting estimate and assumption change in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual result differ from such estimate and assumption we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our finite lived intangible asset whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of finite lived intangible asset group may not be fully recoverable the principal factor in considering when to perform an impairment review are follows significant under performance decline in sale earnings or cash flow of business or product line in relation to expectation annual operating plan or strategic plan outlook that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of business or product line significant negative industry or economic trend or significant change or planned change in our use of the asset once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary recoverability of asset is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flow the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is then measured the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and it fair value we endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value which is usually either market price if available level or level of the fair value hierarchy or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow level of the fair value hierarchy the key estimate in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumption to expected industry and business growth rate sale volume selling price and cost cash flow and the discount rate selected these estimate are subject to change in the economic environment including market interest rate and expected volatility management belief the estimate of future cash flow and fair value are reasonable however change in estimate due to variance from assumption could materially affect the valuation goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing goodwill and intangible asset deemed to have indefinite life are not amortized but are subject to annual or more frequent if necessary impairment testing in testing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset the fair value is estimated utilizing discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecast including strategic and annual operating plan adjusted for terminal value assumption these impairment test involve the use of accounting estimate and assumption change in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual result differ from such estimate and assumption to address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimate and assumption tax on recurring basis we ass the need for valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset by considering all available positive and negative evidence such past operating result projection of future taxable income enacted tax law change and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiative our projection of future taxable income include number of estimate and assumption regarding our volume pricing and cost well the timing and amount of reversal of taxable temporary difference we recognize tax benefit from uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority including resolution of any related appeal and litigation we ass our income tax position based upon our evaluation of the fact circumstance and information available at the reporting date the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement from such position are then measured based on the largest benefit that ha greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with taxing

december current asset recovery for asbestos related liability related product honeywell predecessor allied corporation owned narco from to when the narco business wa sold honeywell predecessor entered into cross indemnity agreement with narco which included an obligation to indemnify the purchaser for asbestos claim such claim arise primarily from alleged occupational exposure to asbestos containing refractory brick and mortar for high temperature application narco ceased manufacturing these product in and the first asbestos claim were filed in the tort system against narco in claim filing and related cost increased dramatically in the late through which led to narco filing for bankruptcy in january once narco filed for bankruptcy all then current and future narco asbestos claim were stayed against both narco and honeywell pending the reorganization of narco international inc note to consolidated financial statement continued dollar in million except per share amount following the bankruptcy filing in december honeywell recorded total narco asbestos liability of billion which wa comprised of three component the estimated liability to settle pre bankruptcy petition narco claim and certain post petition settlement billion referred to pre bankruptcy narco liability ii the estimated liability related to then unasserted narco claim for the period through million referred to narco trust liability and iii other narco bankruptcy related obligation totaling million when the narco trust liability of million wa established in the methodology for estimating the potential liability wa based primarily on epidemiological projection of the future incidence of disease for the period through fifteen year period historical claim rate in the tort system for the five year period prior to the bankruptcy filing date and anticipated narco trust payment value set forth in the then current draft of the narco trust distribution procedure the methodology required estimating by disease three critical input likely number of claim to be asserted against the narco trust in the future ii percentage of those claim likely to receive payment and iii payment value the company utilized outside asbestos liability valuation specialist to support our preparation of the narco trust liability estimate which wa based on commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy court addressing trust in when the company first established it initial liability narco asbestos claim resolution shifted from the tort system to an anticipated narco trust framework where claim would be processed in accordance with established narco trust distribution procedure including strict medical and exposure criterion for plaintiff to receive compensation we believed at the time that the narco trust claim filing and resolution experience after the narco trust became operational would be significantly different from pre bankruptcy tort system experience in light of these more rigorous claim processing requirement in the narco trust distribution procedure and honeywell active oversight of claim processing and approval given these anticipated difference we believed that year time period wa the appropriate horizon for establishing probable and reasonably estimable liability for then unasserted narco claim it represented our best estimate of the time period it would take for the narco trust to be approved by the bankruptcy court become fully operational and generate sufficiently reliable claim data data set which is statistically representative to enable to update our narco trust liability the narco trust distribution procedure were finalized in and the company updated it narco trust liability to reflect the final term and payment value the original year period from through for unasserted claim not change asbestos claim filing continued to be stayed against both honeywell and narco the update resulted in range of the estimated liability for unasserted claim of million to million and we believed that no amount within this range wa better estimate than any other amount in accordance with asc contingency asc we recorded the low end of the range of million the narco trust liability estimate which resulted in reduction of million in our narco trust liability narco emerged from bankruptcy on april at which time federally authorized trust wa established for the evaluation and resolution of all existing and future narco asbestos claim both honeywell and narco are protected by permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual action in state or federal court and requiring all asbestos related claim based on exposure to narco asbestos containing product to be made against the narco trust the narco trust agreement and the narco trust distribution procedure are the principal document setting forth the structure of the narco trust these document establish honeywell evergreen funding obligation honeywell is obligated to fund narco asbestos claim submitted to the narco trust which qualify for payment under the trust distribution procedure annual contribution claim subject to an annual cap of million however the initial million of claim processed through the narco trust the initial claim amount will not count against the annual cap and any unused portion of the initial claim amount will roll over to subsequent year until fully utilized these document also establish the material operating rule for the narco trust including honeywell audit right and the criterion claimant must meet to have valid claim paid these claim payment criterion include providing the narco trust with adequate medical evidence of the claimant asbestos related condition and credible evidence of exposure to specific narco asbestos containing product further the narco trust is eligible to receive cash dividend from harbison walker international inc hwi the reorganized and renamed entity that emerged fully operational from the narco bankruptcy the narco trust is required to use any funding received from hwi to pay annual contribution claim until those fund are exhausted it is only at this point that honeywell funding obligation to the trust is triggered thus there is an unrelated primary source for funding that affect honeywell funding of the narco trust liability international inc note to consolidated financial statement continued dollar in million except per share amount once operational the narco trust began to receive process and pay claim that had been previously stayed pending the trust becoming operational the narco trust began to pay claim in we began to assert our on going audit right to review and monitor the claim processor adherence to the established requirement of the narco trust distribution procedure while so we identified several issue with the way the trust wa implementing the narco trust distribution procedure in honeywell filed suit against the narco trust in bankruptcy court alleging breach of certain provision of the narco trust agreement and narco trust distribution procedure the party agreed to dismiss the proceeding without prejudice pursuant to an month standstill agreement which expired in october notwithstanding it expiration claim processing continues and honeywell continues to negotiate and attempt to resolve remaining disputed issue that is instance where honeywell belief the narco trust is not processing claim in accordance with established narco trust distribution procedure honeywell reserve the right to seek judicial intervention should negotiation fail after the narco trust became effective in the million narco trust liability wa then comprised of liability for unasserted claim and ii liability for claim asserted after the narco trust became operational but not yet paid although the company know the number of claim filed with the narco trust each year it is not able to determine at this time the portion of the narco trust liability which represents asserted versus unasserted claim due to the lack of sufficiently reliable claim data because of the claim processing issue described previously honeywell continues to maintain the narco trust liability the million accrual le payment made to the narco trust for annual contribution claim there ha not been sufficiently reliable claim data history to enable the company to update that liability of december all cash dividend paid to the narco trust by hwi ha been used to pay annual contribution claim in the fourth quarter of honeywell funded million to the narco trust for the payment of annual contribution claim of december the company total narco asbestos liability of million reflects pre bankruptcy narco liability of million and narco trust liability of million the million accrual for narco trust liability wa reduced by the million payment to the narco trust in the fourth quarter of for annual contribution claim through december pre bankruptcy narco liability ha been reduced by approximately billion since first established in largely related to settlement payment the remaining pre bankruptcy narco liability principally represents estimated amount owed pursuant to settlement agreement reached during the pendency of the narco bankruptcy proceeding that provide for the right to submit claim to the narco trust subject to qualification under the term of the settlement agreement and trust distribution procedure the other narco bankruptcy obligation were paid in and no further liability is recorded honeywell continues to evaluate the appropriateness of the narco trust liability estimate despite becoming effective in the narco trust ha experienced delay in becoming fully operational violation of the trust distribution procedure and the resulting dispute and challenge standstill pending dispute resolution and limited claim payment have all contributed to the lack of sufficient normalized data based on actual claim processing experience in the trust since it became operational result we have not been able to further update the narco trust liability aside from deducting payment to the narco trust for annual contribution claim the million narco trust liability estimate continues to be appropriate because of the unresolved pending claim in the trust some portion of which will result in payouts in the future and because new claim continue to be filed with the narco trust when sufficiently reliable claim data exists we will update our estimate of the narco trust liability and it is possible that material change may need to be recognized the company insurance receivable of million of december corresponding to the estimated liability for asserted and unasserted narco asbestos claim reflects coverage which reimburses honeywell for portion of narco related indemnity and defense cost and is provided by large number of insurance policy written by dozen of insurance company in both the domestic insurance market and the london excess market we conduct analysis to estimate the probable amount of insurance that is recoverable for asbestos claim while the substantial majority of our insurance carrier are

those vested right by implementing express limitation cap on the amount honeywell contributed toward healthcare coverage for the retiree honeywell subsequently answered the uaw complaint and asserted

dismissed without prejudice in the opinion the district court held that the mcbas do not promise retiree vested lifetime benefit that survive expiration of the mcbas based on this ruling honeywell terminated the retiree healthcare coverage benefit altogether of july in response the uaw filed motion to enjoin honeywell from completely terminating coverage of july arguing that the cap are vested and that honeywell must continue to provide retiree medical benefit at the capped level on july the district court denied the uaw motion and entered final judgment consistent with it march ruling the uaw ha appealed this decision to the sixth circuit court of appeal honeywell belief the district court ruling will be upheld in the march opinion the district court also held that honeywell is obligated under the mcbas to pay the full premium for retiree healthcare rather than the capped amount based on this ruling honeywell would be required to pay monetary damage to retiree for any past year in which honeywell paid le than the full premium of their healthcare coverage such damage would be limited depending on the retiree group to two to three year period ending when the mcba expired and honeywell would have no ongoing obligation to continue funding healthcare coverage for subsequent period honeywell ha appealed the district court ruling on this full premium damage issue and belief that the sixth circuit court of appeal will reverse the district court on that issue in the event the sixth circuit were to sustain the district court ruling on this issue honeywell would be

act of and rule related to resideo spinoff from honeywell in october on january this putative class action wa consolidated with certain previously filed action asserting claim relating to substantially the same matter into single class action under the title in re resideo technology inc security litigation we believe the allegation against honeywell regarding the resideo spinoff have no merit given the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigation including the specific matter referenced above we do not believe it is possible to develop estimate of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accrual for these matter other than specifically set forth above considering our past experience and existing accrual we do not expect the outcome of these matter either individually or in the aggregate to have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position because most contingency are resolved over long period of time potential liability are subject

applies the specific spot rate along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flow and provides more precise measurement of service and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected cash flow and their corresponding spot rate for our pension plan the single weighted average spot rate used to determine
