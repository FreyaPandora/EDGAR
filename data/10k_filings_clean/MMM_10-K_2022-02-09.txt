market related value is used to determine the expected return on plan asset and the amortization of net unamortized actuarial gain or loss expense component of net periodic benefit cost the company previously used the calculated value approach for all plan asset deferring over three year the impact on these amount of asset gain or loss that differed from expected return changed to the fair value approach for calculating market related value for the fixed income class of plan asset which doe not involve deferring the impact of excess plan asset gain or loss in the determination of these two component of net periodic benefit cost considers the use of the fair value approach preferable to the calculated value approach it result in more current reflection of impact of change in value of these plan asset in the determination of net periodic benefit cost additionally given the plan liability driven investment strategy whereby the change in value of the fixed income plan asset should offset change in the value of the plan liability this approach more closely aligns the expected return on plan asset expense component with the value reflected in the plan funded status this change wa applied retrospectively to all period presented within financial statement the change did not impact consolidated operating income or net cash provided by operating activity but did impact the

return on compensation rate an an athe company provides eligible retiree in the postretirement health care benefit plan to saving account benefit based plan the contribution provided by the company to the health saving account increase percent per year for employee who retired prior to january and increase percent for employee who retire on or after january therefore the company no longer ha material exposure to health care cost inflation the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liability of the december measurement date for the pension and postretirement benefit plan which is also the date used for the related annual measurement assumption the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liability could be effectively settled at the end of the year the company set it rate to reflect the yield of portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instrument that would produce cash flow sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefit using this methodology the company determined discount rate of for the pension plan and for the postretirement benefit plan of december which is an increase of percentage point and percentage point respectively from the rate used of december an increase in the discount rate decrease the projected benefit obligation pbo the increase in the discount rate of december resulted in an approximately billion lower benefit obligation for the pension and postretirement plan the company measure service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation service cost are determined based on duration specific spot rate applied to the service cost cash flow the interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration specific spot rate to the year by year projected benefit payment the spot yield curve approach doe not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation the change in service and interest cost offset in the actuarial gain and loss recorded in other comprehensive income for the primary qualified pension plan the company assumption for the expected return on plan asset wa in projected return are based primarily on broad publicly traded equity and fixed income index and forward looking estimate of active portfolio and investment management of december the company expected long term rate of return on plan asset is the expected return assumption is based on the strategic asset allocation of the plan long term capital market return expectation and expected performance from active investment management the expected long term rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of global equity private equity fixed income security and absolute return investment independent of traditional performance benchmark along with positive return from active investment management the actual net rate of return on plan asset in wa in the plan earned rate of return of and in earned return of the average annual actual return on the plan asset over the past and year ha been and respectively return on asset assumption for international pension and other post retirement benefit plan are calculated on plan by plan basis using plan asset allocation and expected long term rate of return assumption of december the company converted to the pri aggregate mortality table in the company updated the mortality improvement scale to the society of actuary scale mp the december update resulted in an immaterial increase to the pension pbo and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation during the company contributed million to it and international pension plan and million to it postretirement plan during the company contributed million to it and international pension plan and

paymentsthe following table provides the estimated pension and postretirement benefit payment that are payable from the plan to participant qualified and non qualifiedpension benefitspostretirementbenefits million united benefit payment benefit benefit benefit benefit next five plan asset investment strategy for it pension and postretirement plan is to manage the fund on going concern basis the primary goal of the trust fund is to meet the obligation required the secondary goal is to earn the highest rate of return possible without jeopardizing it primary goal and without subjecting the company to an undue amount of contribution risk fund return are used to help finance present and future obligation to the extent possible within actuarially determined funding limit and tax determined asset limit thus reducing the potential need for additional contribution from the investment strategy ha used long duration cash bond and derivative instrument to offset significant portion of the interest rate sensitivity of pension liability normally doe not buy or sell any of it own security direct investment for it pension and other postretirement benefit fund however due to external investment management of the fund the plan may indirectly buy sell or hold security the aggregate amount of security are not considered to be material relative to the aggregate fund percentage the discussion that follows reference the fair value measurement of certain asset in term of level and see note for description of these level while the company belief the valuation method are appropriate and consistent with other market participant the use of different methodology or assumption to determine the fair value of certain financial instrument could result in different estimate of fair value at the reporting date pension plan and postretirement benefit plan assetsin order to achieve the investment objective in the pension plan and postretirement benefit plan the investment policy include target strategic asset allocation the investment policy allow some tolerance around the target in recognition that market fluctuation and illiquidity of some investment may cause the allocation to specific asset class to vary from the target allocation potentially for long period of time acceptable range have been designed to allow for deviation from strategic target and to allow for the opportunity for tactical over and under weight the portfolio will normally be rebalanced when the quarter end asset allocation deviate from acceptable range the allocation is reviewed

from time to time the company also receives subpoena investigative demand or request for information from various government agency the company generally responds in cooperative thorough and timely manner these response sometimes require time and effort and can result in considerable cost being incurred by the company such request can also lead to the assertion of claim or the commencement of administrative civil or criminal legal proceeding against the company and others well to settlement the outcome of legal proceeding and regulatory matter are often difficult to predict any

remedy including disgorgement suspension or debarment or injunctive relief process for disclosure and recording of liability related to legal proceedingsmany lawsuit and claim involve highly complex issue relating to causation scientific evidence and alleged actual damage all of which are otherwise subject to substantial uncertainty assessment of lawsuit and claim can involve series of complex judgment about future event and can rely heavily on estimate and assumption when making determination about recording liability related to legal proceeding the company complies with the requirement of asc contingency and related guidance and record liability in those instance where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the loss is probable where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is range the company record an accrual in it financial statement the most likely estimate of the loss or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate the company either discloses the amount of possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accrual if estimable or state that such an estimate can not be made the company discloses significant legal proceeding even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable or both if the company belief there is at least reasonable possibility that loss may be incurred because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainty and unfavorable ruling or development could occur there can be no certainty that the company may not ultimately incur charge in excess of presently recorded liability many of the matter described are at preliminary stage or seek an indeterminate amount of damage it is not uncommon for claim to be resolved over many year future adverse ruling settlement unfavorable development or increase in accrual for one or more of these matter could result in future charge that could have material adverse effect on the company result of operation or cash flow in the period in which they are recorded based on experience and development the company reexamines it estimate of probable liability and associated expense and receivables each period and whether it is

respirator mask asbestos litigationas of december the company is named defendant with multiple co defendant in numerous lawsuit in various court that purport to represent approximately individual claimant compared to approximately individual claimant with action pending on december the vast majority of the lawsuit and claim resolved by and currently pending against the company allege use of some of the company mask and respirator product and seek damage from the company and other defendant for alleged personal injury from workplace exposure to asbestos silica coal mine dust or other occupational dust found in product manufactured by other defendant or generally in the workplace minority of the lawsuit and claim resolved by and currently pending against the company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from product previously manufactured by the company which are often unspecified well product manufactured by other defendant or occasionally at company premise the company current volume of new and pending matter is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filing in the company expects that filing of claim by unimpaired claimant in the future will continue to be at much lower level than in the past accordingly the number of claim alleging more serious injury including mesothelioma other malignancy and black lung disease will represent greater percentage of total claim than in the past over the past twenty plus year the company ha prevailed in fifteen of the sixteen case tried to jury including the lawsuit in described below in received jury verdict in it favor in two lawsuit one in california state court in february and the other in massachusetts state court in december both involving allegation that respirator were defective and failed to protect the plaintiff against asbestos fiber in april jury in state court in kentucky found respirator failed to protect two coal miner from coal mine dust and awarded compensatory damage of approximately million and punitive damage totaling million in august the trial court entered judgment and the company appealed during march and april the company agreed in principle to settle substantial majority of the then pending coal mine dust lawsuit in kentucky and west virginia for million including the jury verdict in april in the kentucky case mentioned above that settlement wa completed in and the appeal ha been dismissed in october defended respirator case before jury in king county washington involving former shipyard worker who alleged respirator wa defective and that acted negligently in failing to protect against asbestos fiber the jury delivered complete defense verdict in favor of concluding that the respirator wa not defective in design or warning and any conduct by wa not cause of plaintiff mesothelioma the plaintiff appeal is pending ruling is expected during the first quarter of the company ha demonstrated in these past trial proceeding that it respiratory protection product are effective claimed when used in the intended manner and in the intended circumstance consequently the company belief that claimant are unable to establish that their medical condition even if significant are attributable to the company respiratory protection product nonetheless the company litigation experience indicates that claim of person alleging more serious injury including mesothelioma other malignancy and black lung disease are costlier to resolve than the claim of unimpaired person and it therefore belief the average cost of resolving pending and future claim on per claim basis will continue to be higher than it experienced in prior period when the vast majority of claim were asserted by medically unimpaired claimant since the second half of the company ha experienced an increase in the number of case filed that allege injury from exposure to coal mine dust that increase represents the substantial majority of the growth in case number referred to above previously reported the state of west virginia through it attorney general filed complaint in against the company and two other manufacturer of respiratory protection product in the circuit court of lincoln county west virginia and amended it complaint in the amended complaint seek substantial but unspecified compensatory damage primarily for reimbursement of the cost allegedly incurred by the state for worker compensation and healthcare benefit provided to all worker with occupational pneumoconiosis and unspecified punitive damage in october the court granted the state motion to sever it unfair trade practice claim in january the manufacturer filed petition with the west virginia supreme court challenging the trial court ruling that petition wa denied in november trial for the unfair trade practice claim ha been set for august no liability ha been recorded for this matter because the company belief that

coal mine dust lawsuit in kentucky and west virginia at the time of the charge of december the company had an accrual for respirator mask asbestos liability excluding aearo accrual of million this accrual represents the company best estimate of probable loss and reflects an estimation period for future claim that may be filed against the company approaching the year the company can not estimate the amount or upper end of the range of amount by which the liability may exceed the accrual the company ha established because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claim that have not yet been asserted or the time period in which future claim may be asserted ii the complaint nearly always assert claim against multiple defendant where the damage alleged are typically not attributed to individual defendant that defendant share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability which can vary by state iii the multiple factor described above that the company

the cost of resolving claim of person who claim more serious injury responsibility for legal cost well for settlement and judgment is currently shared in an informal arrangement among aearo cabot american optical corporation and subsidiary of warner lambert and their respective insurer the payor group liability is allocated among the party based on the number of year each company sold respiratory product under the ao safety brand and or owned the ao safety division of american optical corporation and the alleged year of exposure of the individual plaintiff aearo share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement entered into between aearo and cabot on july this agreement provides that so long aearo pay to cabot quarterly fee of cabot will retain responsibility and liability for and indemnify aearo against any product liability claim involving exposure to asbestos silica or silica product for respirator sold prior to july because of the difficulty in determining how long particular respirator remains in the stream of commerce after being sold aearo and cabot have applied the agreement to claim arising out of the alleged use of

inaccurate the company can not determine the impact of these potential development on it current estimate of aearo share of liability for these existing and future claim if any of the development described above were to occur the actual amount of these liability for existing and future claim could be significantly larger than the amount accrued because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claim that have not yet been asserted the complexity of allocating responsibility for future claim among the payor group and the several possible development that may occur that could
