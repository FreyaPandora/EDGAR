business financial condition or result of operation you should read these risk factor in conjunction with management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation in item and our consolidated financial statement and related note in item general economic condition both in the and internationally may adversely affect our result of operation we conduct operation in over country and territory our and international operation are subject to normal cycle affecting the economy in general well the local economic environment in which we operate the factor that create cyclical change to the economy and to our business are beyond our control and it may be difficult for to adjust our business model to mitigate the impact of these factor in particular our business is affected by level of industrial production consumer spending and retail activity and our business financial position and result of operation could be materially affected by adverse development in these aspect of the economy we face significant competition which could adversely affect our business financial position and result of operation we face significant competition on local regional national and international basis our competitor include the postal service of the and other nation various motor carrier express company freight forwarders air courier and others competition may also come from other source in the future some of our competitor have cost and organizational structure that differ from and may offer service and pricing term that we may not be willing or able to offer if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressure our business financial position and result of operation could be adversely affected the transportation industry continues to consolidate and competition remains strong result of consolidation our competitor may increase their market share and improve their financial capacity and may strengthen their competitive position business combination could also result in competitor providing wider variety of service and product at competitive price which could adversely affect our financial performance change in our relationship with our significant customer including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them could have an adverse impact on no single customer account for or more of our consolidated revenue we do not believe the loss of any single customer would materially impair our overall financial condition or result of operation however collectively some of our large customer might account for relatively significant portion of the growth in revenue in particular quarter or year these customer can drive the growth in revenue for particular service based on factor such new customer product launch the seasonality associated with the fourth quarter holiday season business merger and acquisition and the overall fast growth of customer underlying business these customer could choose to divert all or portion of their business with to one of our competitor demand pricing concession for our service require to provide enhanced service that increase our cost or develop their own shipping and distribution capability if these factor drove some of our large customer to cancel all or portion of their business relationship with it could materially impact the growth in our business and the ability to meet our current and long term financial forecast business is subject to complex and stringent regulation in the and internationally we are subject to complex and stringent aviation transportation environmental security labor employment and other governmental law regulation and policy both in the and in the other country in which we operate in addition our business is impacted by law regulation and policy that affect global trade including tariff and trade policy export requirement tax monetary policy and other restriction and charge change in law regulation and policy and the related interpretation may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our cost of business the impact of new law regulation and policy can not be predicted compliance with new law and regulation may increase our operating cost or require significant capital expenditure any failure to comply with applicable law or regulation in the or in any of the country in which we operate could result in substantial fine or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operation which could adversely affect our financial performance increased security requirement could impose substantial cost on and we could be the target of an attack or have security breach result of concern about global terrorism and homeland security government around the world have adopted or may adopt stricter security requirement that will result in increased operating cost for business in the transportation industry these requirement may change periodically result of regulatory and legislative requirement and in response to evolving threat we can not determine the effect that these new requirement will have on our cost structure or our operating result and these rule or other future security requirement may increase our cost of operation and reduce operating efficiency regardless of our compliance with security requirement or the step we take to secure our facility or fleet we could be the target of an attack or security breach could occur which could adversely affect our operation or our reputation we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market response to such potential change concern over climate change including the impact of global warming ha led to significant federal state and international legislative and regulatory effort to limit greenhouse gas ghg emission for example in the past several year the congress ha considered various bill that would regulate ghg emission while these bill have not yet received sufficient congressional support for enactment some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future even in the absence of such legislation the environmental protection agency spurred by judicial interpretation of the clean air act may regulate ghg emission especially aircraft or diesel engine emission and this could impose substantial cost on these cost include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital cost associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicle prematurely the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we can not predict it effect on our cost structure or our operating result it is reasonably possible that such legislation or regulation could impose material cost on moreover even without such legislation or regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by company in the airline and transportation industry could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our service especially our air service strike work stoppage and slowdown by our employee could adversely affect our business financial position and result of operation significant number of our employee are employed under national master agreement and various supplemental agreement with local union affiliated with the teamster in addition our airline pilot airline mechanic ground mechanic and certain other employee are employed under other collective bargaining agreement strike work stoppage and slowdown by our employee could adversely affect our ability to meet our customer need and customer may do more business with competitor if they believe that such action or threatened action may adversely affect our ability to provide service we may face permanent loss of customer if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service and this could adversely affect our business financial position and result of operation the term of future collective bargaining agreement also may affect our competitive position and result of operation are exposed to the effect of changing price of energy including gasoline diesel and jet fuel and interruption in supply of these commodity changing fuel and energy cost may have significant impact on our operation we require significant quantity of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicle and are exposed to the risk associated with variation in the market price for petroleum product including gasoline diesel and jet fuel we mitigate our exposure to changing fuel price through our indexed fuel surcharge and we may also enter into hedging transaction from time to time if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharge higher fuel cost could adversely impact our operating result even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharge high fuel surcharge may result in mix shift from our higher yielding air product to lower yielding ground product or an overall reduction in volume if fuel price rise sharply even if we are successful in increasing our fuel surcharge we could experience lag time in implementing the surcharge which could adversely affect our short term operating result there can be no assurance that our hedging transaction will be effective to protect from change in fuel price moreover we could experience disruption in energy supply including our supply of gasoline diesel and jet fuel result of war action by producer or other factor beyond our control which could have an adverse effect on our business change in exchange rate or interest rate may have an adverse effect on our result we conduct business across the globe with significant portion of our revenue derived from operation outside the united state our operation in international market are affected by change in the exchange rate for local currency and in particular the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar we are exposed to change in interest rate primarily on our short term debt and that portion of our long term debt that carry floating interest rate the impact of basis point change in interest rate affecting our debt is discussed in the quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk section of this report additionally change in interest rate impact the valuation of our pension and postretirement benefit obligation and the related benefit cost recognized in the income statement the impact of change in interest rate on our pension and postretirement benefit obligation and cost is discussed further in the critical accounting policy and estimate section of this report we monitor and manage our exposure to change in currency exchange rate and interest rate and make use of derivative instrument to mitigate the impact of change in these rate on our financial position and result of operation however change in exchange rate and interest rate can not always be predicted or hedged if we are unable to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation our business may suffer our success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the ups brand and our reputation for providing excellent service to our customer service quality issue actual or perceived even when false or unfounded could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customer to use other company also adverse publicity surrounding labor relation environmental concern security matter political activity and the like or attempt to connect our company to these sort of issue either in the united state or other country in which we operate could negatively affect our overall reputation and acceptance of our service by customer damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our service and thus have an adverse effect on our business financial position and result of operation and could require additional resource to rebuild our reputation and restore the

obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage system change frequently may be difficult to detect for long time and often are not recognized until launched against target result we may be unable to anticipate these technique or to implement adequate preventative measure any of these occurrence could result in disruption in our operation the loss of existing or potential customer

factor which are subject to uncertainty such general economic trend change in governmental regulation and competition if we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment need we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity either of which would negatively affect our revenue and profitability in addition to forecasting our capital investment requirement we adjust other element of our operation and cost structure in response to adverse economic condition however these adjustment may not be sufficient to allow to maintain our operating margin in weak economy we derive significant portion of our revenue from our international operation and are subject to the risk of doing business in international market we have significant international operation and while the geographical diversity of our international operation help ensure that we are not overly reliant on single region or country we are continually exposed to changing economic political and social development beyond our control emerging market are typically more volatile than those in the developed world and any broad based downturn in these market could reduce our revenue and adversely affect

ha resulted from time to time in significant impairment and we may in the future be required to recognize additional impairment charge change in business strategy government regulation or economic or market condition have resulted and may result in further substantial impairment of our intangible fixed or other asset at any time in the future in addition we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charge if we determine that the useful life of our fixed asset are shorter than we originally estimated such change could reduce our net income employee health and retiree health and pension benefit cost represent significant expense to with approximately employee including approximately in the our expense relating to employee health and retiree health and pension benefit are significant in recent year we have experienced significant increase in some of these cost largely result of economic factor beyond our control including in particular ongoing increase in health care cost well in excess of the rate of inflation and the decreasing trend of discount rate that we use to value our pension liability continued increasing health care cost volatility in investment return and discount rate well change in law regulation and assumption used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expense may adversely affect our business financial position result of operation or require significant contribution to our pension plan the new national master agreement with the teamster includes change that are designed to mitigate certain of these health care expense but there can be no assurance that our effort will be successful or that the failure or success of these effort will not adversely affect our business financial position

is discussed in further detail in the collective bargaining agreement section this charge wa recorded in compensation and benefit expense in our statement of consolidated income and impacted our domestic package segment result of operation segment reviewthe result and discussion that follow are reflective of how our executive management monitor the performance of our reporting segment we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principle gaap with certain non gaap financial measure including operating profit operating margin pre tax income net income and earnings per share adjusted for the non comparable item discussed previously we believe that these adjusted measure provide meaningful information to assist investor and analyst in understanding our financial result and assessing our prospect for future performance we believe these adjusted financial measure are important indicator of our recurring result of operation because they exclude item that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating result and provide better baseline for analyzing trend in our underlying business additionally these adjusted financial measure are used internally by management for the determination of incentive compensation award business unit operating performance analysis and business unit resource allocation discussed in our critical accounting policy and estimate we recognize change in the fair value of plan asset and net actuarial gain and loss in excess of corridor immediately part of net periodic benefit cost in our result of operation and the discussion that follow we have presented adjusted operating expense adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin excluding the portion of net periodic benefit cost represented by the gain and loss recognized in excess of the corridor this adjusted net periodic benefit cost is comparable to the accounting for our defined benefit plan in our quarterly reporting under gaap and reflects assumption utilizing the expected return on plan asset and the discount rate used for determining net periodic benefit cost the non adjusted net periodic benefit cost reflects the actual return on plan asset and the discount rate used for measuring the projected benefit obligation we believe this adjusted net periodic benefit cost provides important supplemental information that reflects the anticipated long term cost of our defined benefit plan and provides benchmark for historical defined benefit cost trend that can be used to better compare year to year financial performance without considering the short term impact of change in market interest rate equity price and similar factor certain operating expense are allocated between our reporting segment based on activity based costing method these activity based costing method require to make estimate that impact the amount of each expense category that is attributed to each segment

highway diesel fuel price in connection with our base rate increase on december we modified the fuel surcharge on air and ground service by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by and respectively based on published rate the average fuel surcharge rate for domestic air and ground product were follows year ended december point change day air total fuel surcharge revenue declined by million in lower fuel surcharge rate driven by lower fuel price slightly more than offset the impact of increased air and ground volume in total fuel surcharge revenue declined by million due to lower fuel surcharge rate driven primarily by the reduction in the index on both the air and ground surcharge well lower fuel price operating compared to adjusted operating expense for the segment increased billion in primarily due to pick up and delivery cost up million the cost of operating our domestic integrated air and ground network up million and the cost of package sorting up million these cost were impacted by several factor we incurred higher employee compensation cost largely resulting from an increase in average daily union labor hour up union contractual wage rate increase increased employee healthcare expense and growth in the overall size of the workforce the increase in labor hour wa driven by volume growth additional overtime and training hour during our fourth quarter holiday shipping season and adverse weather condition in early we incurred higher expense associated with outside contract carrier due to volume growth issue associated with the service performance of rail carrier and the adverse weather condition in early these cost increase were partially offset by reduction in worker compensation expense due to actuarial adjustment that were largely attributable to operational safety and claim management initiative these cost increase were also mitigated by certain network efficiency and productivity improvement which resulted in reduction in the total adjusted cost per piece in compared with we have continued to adjust our air and ground network to better match higher volume level utilize technology to increase package sorting and delivery efficiency and benefit from improved pick up and delivery density particularly for our residential product these improvement allowed to process increased volume up at faster rate than the increase in average daily aircraft block hour up and vehicle mile driven up in the fourth quarter of adjusted operating expense increased decreased productivity higher contract carrier rate and additional union overtime and training hour contributed to approximately million in excess cost in order to process the significant increase in package volume while maintaining service level we increased our overall capacity through additional staffing more equipment rental and new operating facility additionally we elected to operate on one additional day during the fourth quarter of to further improve service level however the significant variability in package volume during the holiday shipping season resulted in sub optimized transportation network and reduction in productivity average daily union labor hour increased compared with the volume increase of the total adjusted cost per piece in the fourth quarter of increased compared with the fourth quarter of parcel service inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of compared to adjusted operating expense for the segment increased billion in compared with this increase wa primarily due to pick up and delivery cost which grew million well the cost of operating our domestic integrated air and ground network which increased million for the year the growth in pick up and delivery and network cost wa largely due to increased volume and higher employee compensation cost which were impacted by union contractual wage increase package driver wage rate rose an increase in average daily driver hour up and an increase in employee pension and healthcare cost partially offsetting these cost increase wa reduction in worker compensation expense due to actuarial adjustment that were largely attributable to operational safety and claim management initiative cost increase have been mitigated we adjust our air and ground network to better match higher volume level and

efficiency improvement allowed to process increased volume up at faster rate than the increase in average daily union labor hour up aircraft block hour down and mile driven up in compared with result the total adjusted cost per piece increased only in several factor caused our fourth quarter operating expense to significantly increase adjusted operating expense increased million or in the fourth quarter of compared with the same period of higher than planned volume growth combined with adverse weather condition and the relatively compressed holiday shipping season in there were six fewer day between the thanksgiving and christmas holiday in relative to resulted in significant increase in labor hour and the greater use of contract carrier to help meet our service commitment additionally the much later than anticipated seasonal increase in volume during the fourth quarter strained our transportation network resulting in lower productivity total union labor hour increased while volume increased in the fourth quarter operating profit and compared to adjusted operating profit decreased million in compared with and wa impacted by several factor we incurred approximately million of additional operating cost during the fourth quarter holiday shipping season largely due to decreased productivity higher contract carrier rate and additional union overtime and training hour the unfavorable weather condition in the in early reduced operating profit approximately million in including the estimated loss in package volume increased guaranteed service refund to customer and higher operating expense additionally change in customer and product mix combined to pressure our revenue per piece these factor were partially offset by solid volume growth and the overall productivity improvement resulting in lower cost per piece discussed previously the combination of these factor led to basis point decline in our operating margin in compared with compared to adjusted operating profit increased million in compared with the volume growth and productivity improvement discussed previously more than offset the pressure on revenue per piece and the adverse impact of fuel overall volume growth allowed to better leverage our transportation network resulting in greater productivity and better pick up and delivery density however these factor were partially offset by change in customer and product mix which combined to pressure our revenue per piece additionally the net impact of fuel adversely affected operating profit by million in compared with fuel surcharge revenue decreased at faster rate than fuel expense although annual adjusted operating profit improved in it declined by million in the fourth quarter of compared with the fourth quarter of this decline in profitability wa largely due to additional labor and purchased transportation cost heavier than anticipated volume adverse weather condition and compressed holiday shipping season combined to result in approximately to million in extra cost in the fourth quarter of in addition we incurred approximately million in service refund for unmet delivery commitment in the fourth quarter of the

received approximately million of cash tax benefit through reduced federal and state quarterly income tax payment in for nma group employee who retired prior to january and remained with the ups

these health and welfare plan change including liability transfer we have removed significant liability from our balance sheet which help to reduce uncertainty around potential change to healthcare law and regulation control the volatility of healthcare inflation and remove the risk associated with providing future retiree healthcare negotiated healthcare cost using the model of defined

multiemployer plan have several advantage under the patient protection and affordable care act of including reduced transitional fee and the ability to limit the impact of future excise tax mitigate demographic issue this help reduce the potential impact of increased early retirement by employee agreement with the new england teamster and trucking industry pension fundin the third quarter of we reached an agreement with the new england pension fund multiemployer pension plan in which ups is participant to restructure the pension liability for approximately ups employee represented by the teamster the agreement reflects decision by the new england pension fund trustee to restructure the fund through plan amendment to utilize two pool approach which effectively subdivides the plan asset and liability between two group of beneficiary part of this agreement ups agreed to withdraw from the original pool of the new england pension fund of which it had historically been participant and reenter the new england pension fund newly established pool new employer parcel service inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operationsupon ratification of the agreement by the teamster in september we withdrew from the original pool of the new england pension fund and incurred an undiscounted withdrawal liability of billion to be paid in equal monthly installment over year the undiscounted withdrawal liability wa calculated by independent actuary employed by the new england pension fund in accordance with the governing plan document and the applicable requirement of the employee retirement income security act of in the third quarter of we recorded charge to expense to establish an million withdrawal liability on our balance sheet which represents the present value of the billion future payment obligation discounted at interest rate this discount rate represents the estimated credit adjusted market rate of interest at which we could obtain financing of similar maturity and seniority part of this agreement we believe that ups the new england pension fund and our affected employee have obtained several benefit including the old pool of the new england pension fund ha historically had and would likely continue to have funding challenge this represented risk to ups of having to face higher future contribution requirement well risk to the security of the pension benefit of those ups employee who participate in the new england pension fund the year fixed payment obligation should improve the funded status of the new england pension fund over time while reducing the risk to ups of significantly higher future contribution requirement the newly established pool provides better protection for new participating employer this pool us direct attribution methodology for calculating any potential future withdrawal liability which reduces our exposure to the liability of other participating employer additionally this pool contains provision designed to maintain fully funded status including automatic benefit reduction and or increased employee contribution in the event of an underfunded situation occurring part of the agreement we were able to freeze our hourly pension contribution rate to the newly established pool of the new england pension fund for period of year which provides cash flow visibility for both ups and the new england pension fund the million charge to expense recorded in the third quarter of is included in compensation and benefit expense in the statement of consolidated income while the corresponding withdrawal liability is included in other non current liability on the consolidated balance sheet we will impute interest on the withdrawal liability using the discount rate while the monthly payment made to the new england pension fund will reduce the remaining balance of the withdrawal liability our status in the newly established pool of the new england pension fund is accounted for the participation in new multiemployer pension plan and therefore we will recognize expense based on the contractually required contribution for each period and we will recognize liability for any contribution due and unpaid at the end of reporting period rate adjustmentsin october we announced an average net increase in base and accessorial rate that took effect december and

statement for discussion of recently adopted accounting standard accounting standard issued but not yet effectivesee note to the audited consolidated financial statement for discussion of accounting standard issued but not yet effective critical accounting policy and estimatesour discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operation are based on our consolidated financial statement which are prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america indicated in note to our consolidated financial statement the amount of asset liability revenue and expense reported in our financial statement are affected by estimate and judgment that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principle we base our estimate on prior experience and other assumption that we consider reasonable to our circumstance actual result could differ from our estimate which would affect the related amount reported in our consolidated financial statement while estimate and judgment are applied in arriving at many reported amount we believe that the following matter may involve higher degree of judgment and complexity contingenciesas discussed in note to our consolidated financial statement we are involved in various legal proceeding and contingency the event that may impact our contingent liability are often unique and generally are not predictable at the time contingency is identified we consider all relevant fact part of our evaluation we record liability for loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable event may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of contingency may result in loss to that differs from our previously estimated liability these factor could result in material difference between estimated and actual operating result contingent loss that are probable and estimable excluding those related to income tax and self insurance which are discussed further below were not material to our financial position or result of operation of and for the year ended december in addition we have certain contingent liability that have not been recognized of december because loss is not reasonably estimable goodwill and intangible impairmentwe perform impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting unit on an annual basis our reporting unit are comprised of the europe asia america and ismea indian subcontinent middle east and africa reporting unit in the international package reporting segment and the forwarding logistics ups freight the ups store and ups capital reporting unit in the supply chain freight reporting segment our annual goodwill impairment testing date is october for each reporting unit in assessing goodwill for impairment we initially evaluate qualitative factor to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of reporting unit then we utilize two step process to test goodwill for impairment first comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying value including goodwill is performed if the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill parcel service inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operationswe primarily determine the fair value of our reporting unit using discounted cash flow model dcf model and supplement this with observable valuation multiple for comparable company applicable the completion of the dcf model requires that we make number of significant assumption to produce an estimate of future cash flow these assumption include projection of future revenue cost and working capital change in addition we make assumption about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variable required in estimating the fair value of our reporting unit the projection that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business condition for each of our reporting unit the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves significant level of judgment in these assumption and change in our business strategy government regulation or economic or market condition could significantly impact these judgment we will continue to monitor market condition and other factor to determine if interim impairment test are necessary in future period if impairment indicator are present in future period the resulting impairment charge could have material impact on our result of operation none of the reporting unit incurred any goodwill impairment charge in or change in our forecast could cause carrying value of our reporting unit to exceed their fair value in future period potentially resulting in goodwill impairment charge decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting unit of our most recent goodwill testing date october would not result in goodwill impairment charge

annual basis all of our remaining recorded intangible asset are deemed to be finite lived intangible and are thus amortized over their estimated useful life impairment test for these intangible asset are only performed when triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flow of the intangible if the

claim automotive liability health and welfare and general business liability up to certain limit insurance reserve are established for estimate of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claim well estimate of claim that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balance are based on reserve level which incorporate historical loss experience and judgment about the present and expected level of cost per claim trend in actual experience are significant factor in the determination of such reserve we believe our estimated reserve for such claim are adequate but actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimate and affect our result of operation worker compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claim may take several year to completely settle consequently actuarial estimate are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claim number of factor can affect the actual cost of claim including the length of time the claim remains open trend in health care cost and the result of related litigation furthermore claim may emerge in future year for event that occurred in prior year at rate that differs from previous actuarial projection change in state legislation with respect to worker compensation can affect the adequacy of our self insurance accrual all of these factor can result in revision to prior actuarial projection and produce material difference between estimated and actual operating result we sponsor number of health and welfare insurance plan for our employee these liability and related expense are based on estimate of the number of employee and eligible dependent covered under the plan anticipated medical usage by participant and overall trend in medical cost and inflation actual result may differ from these estimate and therefore produce material difference between estimated and actual operating result parcel service inc and

mortality rate and other factor the assumption utilized in recording the obligation under our plan represent our best estimate and we believe that they are reasonable based on information to historical experience and performance well other factor that might cause future expectation to differ from past trend difference in actual experience or change in assumption may affect our pension and other postretirement obligation and future expense the primary factor contributing to actuarial gain and loss each year are change in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit

plan well our postretirement medical plan parcel service inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operationsdepreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assetsas of december we had billion of net fixed asset the most significant category of which is aircraft in accounting for fixed asset we make estimate about the expected useful life and the expected residual value of the asset and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the asset and the cash flow generated by these asset in estimating the life and expected residual value of aircraft we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft type subsequent revision to these estimate could be caused by change to our maintenance program change in the utilization of the aircraft governmental regulation on aging aircraft and changing market price of new and used aircraft of the same or similar type we periodically evaluate these estimate and assumption and adjust the estimate and assumption necessary adjustment to the expected life and residual value are accounted for on prospective basis through depreciation expense we review long lived asset for impairment when circumstance indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flow of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable write down to fair value is recorded fair value are determined based on quoted market value discounted cash flow or external appraisal applicable we review long lived asset for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flow can be identified the circumstance that would indicate potential impairment may include but are not limited to significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized and operating or cash flow loss associated with the use of the asset in estimating cash flow we project future volume level for our different air express product in all geographic region in which we do business adverse change in these volume forecast or shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projection could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand this situation would lead to an excess of particular aircraft type resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type thus resulting in increased depreciation expense there were no impairment charge on our property plant and equipment during and fair value measurementsin the normal course of business we hold and issue financial instrument that contain element of market risk including derivative marketable security finance receivables other investment and debt certain of these financial instrument are required to be recorded at fair value principally derivative marketable security pension asset and certain other investment fair value are based on listed market price when such price are available to the extent that listed market price are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factor including dealer price quotation certain financial instrument including over the counter derivative instrument are valued using pricing model that consider among other factor contractual and market price correlation time value credit spread and yield curve volatility factor change in the fixed income equity foreign exchange and commodity market will impact our estimate of fair value in the future potentially affecting our result of operation quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to change in commodity price foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and equity price is presented in the quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk section of this report income taxeswe make certain estimate and judgment in determining income tax expense for financial statement purpose these estimate and judgment occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction tax credit benefit and deduction and in the calculation of certain tax asset and liability which arise from difference in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purpose well the interest and penalty related to these uncertain tax position significant change to these estimate may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in subsequent period we ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for tax by recording valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover substantial majority of the deferred tax asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet however should there be change in our ability to recover our deferred tax asset our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery wa not likely parcel service inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operationsthe calculation of our tax liability involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulation we recognize liability for uncertain tax position based on two step process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any once it is determined that the position meet the recognition threshold the second step requires to estimate and measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amount we have to determine the probability of various possible outcome we reevaluate these uncertain tax position on quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factor including but not limited to change in fact or circumstance change in tax law effectively settled issue under audit and new audit activity such change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision allowance for doubtful accountslosses on account receivable are recognized when they are incurred which requires to make our best estimate of the probable loss inherent in our customer receivables at each balance sheet date these estimate require consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current condition trend in customer payment frequency and judgment about the probable effect of relevant observable data including present economic condition and the financial health of specific customer and market sector our risk management process includes standard and policy for reviewing major account exposure and concentration of risk deterioration in macroeconomic variable could result in our ultimate loss exposure on our account receivable being significantly higher than what we have currently estimated and reserved for in our allowance for doubtful account our total allowance for doubtful account of december and wa and million respectively our total provision for doubtful account charged to expense during the year ended december and wa and million respectively item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskwe are exposed to market risk from change in certain commodity price foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and equity price all of these market risk arise in the normal course of business we do not engage in speculative trading activity in order to manage the risk arising from these exposure we utilize variety of commodity foreign exchange and interest rate forward contract option and swap discussion of our accounting policy for derivative instrument and further disclosure are provided in note to the consolidated financial statement commodity price riskwe are exposed to change in the price of refined fuel principally jet diesel and unleaded gasoline well change in the price of natural gas currently the fuel surcharge that we apply to our domestic and international package and ltl service are the primary mean of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price change additionally we periodically use combination of option forward and future contract to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy price of december and however we had no commodity contract outstanding foreign currency exchange riskwe have foreign currency risk related to our revenue operating expense and financing transaction in currency other than the local currency in which we operate we are exposed to currency risk from the potential change in functional currency value of our foreign currency denominated asset liability and cash flow our most significant foreign currency exposure relate to the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar we use combination of purchased and written option to hedge forecasted cash flow currency exposure these derivative instrument generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposure for period of to month we also utilize forward contract to hedge portion of our anticipated cash settlement of intercompany transaction subject to foreign currency remeasurement additionally we utilize cross currency interest rate swap to hedge the currency risk inherent in the interest and principal payment associated with foreign currency denominated debt obligation the term of these swap agreement are commensurate with the underlying debt obligation parcel service inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operationsinterest rate riskwe have issued debt instrument including debt associated with capital lease that accrue expense at fixed and floating rate of interest we use combination of interest rate swap part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing the notional amount interest payment and maturity date of the swap match the term of the associated debt we also utilize forward starting swap and similar instrument to lock in all or portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuance our floating rate debt and interest rate swap subject to risk resulting from change in short term primarily libor interest rate we also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligation change in interest rate will effectively increase or decrease our liability associated with these benefit plan which also result in change to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized in future period we have investment in debt security well cash equivalent instrument some of which accrue income at variable rate of interest additionally we hold portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rate of interest equity price riskwe hold investment in various common equity security that are subject to price risk these security are primarily in the form of equity index fund sensitivity analysisthe following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instrument we utilize valuation model to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instrument with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shift in exchange rate interest rate yield curve and commodity and equity price for option and instrument with non linear return model appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shift there are certain limitation inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented primarily due to the assumption that exchange rate change in parallel fashion and that interest rate change instantaneously in addition the analysis are unable to reflect the complex market reaction that normally would arise from the market shift modeled while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario these estimate should not be viewed forecast we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive asset and liability in response to change in market condition additionally change in the fair value of foreign currency derivative and commodity derivative are offset by change in the cash flow of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transaction shock test result of december in million in fair value currency derivative change in annual interest expense variable rate debt rate derivative in annual interest income marketable security the potential change in fair value from hypothetical weakening of the dollar against local currency exchange rate across all maturity the potential change in annual interest expense resulting from hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rate applied to our variable rate debt and swap instrument excluding hedge of anticipated debt issuance the potential change in interest income resulting from hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rate applied to our variable rate investment holding the sensitivity of our pension and postretirement

single counterparty we have agreement with all of our active counterparties covering the majority of our derivative position containing early termination right and or zero threshold bilateral collateral provision whereby cash is required based on the net fair value of derivative associated with those counterparties event such counterparty credit rating downgrade depending on the ultimate
