compensation plan which are common in the technology industry in each fiscal year our total revenue and operating margin are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter the operating margin of our business in particular our cloud and license business and hardware business are generally affected by seasonal factor in similar manner our revenue because certain expense within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term see cloud and license business and selected quarterly financial data in item of this annual report for more information

range from company offering broad it solution across many of our line of business to vendor providing point solution or offering focused on specific functionality product area or industry in addition we expand into new market segment we face increased competition we compete with existing competitor well firm that may be partner in other area of our business and other firm with whom we have not previously competed moreover we or our competitor may take certain strategic action including acquisition partnership and joint venture or repositioning of product line which invite even greater competition in one or more product offering category key competitive factor in each of the segment in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include total cost of ownership performance scalability reliability security functionality efficiency speed to production and quality of technical support our product and service sale and the relative strength of our product and service versus those of our competitor are also directly and indirectly affected by the following among other thing the adoption of cloud based it offering including saas and iaa offering ease of deployment use and maintenance of our product and service offering compatibility between oracle product and service deployed within local it environment and public cloud it environment including our

statement item risk factor we operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environment that present numerous risk many of which are driven by factor that we can not control or predict the following discussion well our critical accounting policy and estimate discussion in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation item highlight some of these risk the risk described below are not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risk and uncertainty investing in our security our success depends upon our ability to develop new product and service integrate acquired product and service and enhance our existing product and service rapid technological advance intense competition changing delivery model and evolving standard in computer hardware and software development and communication infrastructure changing and increasingly sophisticated customer need and frequent new product introduction and enhancement characterize the industry in which we compete if we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated product and service enhance and improve our product offering and support service in timely manner or position and price our product and service to meet demand customer may not purchase or subscribe to our license hardware or cloud offering or renew license support hardware support or cloud subscription contract renewal of these contract are important to the growth of our business in addition we can not provide any assurance that the standard on which we choose to develop new product will allow to compete effectively for business opportunity in emerging area we have continued to refresh and release new offering of our cloud product and service including the launch of the oracle autonomous data warehouse cloud service the oracle autonomous data warehouse cloud service offer automation based on machine learning and we have guaranteed among other matter that it will reduce customer downtime to le than minute year and that amazon data warehouse customer will see significant cost reduction if they migrate their workload to our offering machine learning and artificial intelligence are increasingly driving innovation in technology but if they fail to operate anticipated or the oracle autonomous data warehouse cloud service or our other product do not perform promised our business and reputation may be harmed in addition our business may be adversely affected if we do not continue to develop and release new or enhanced product and service within the anticipated time frame infrastructure cost to deliver new or enhanced product and service take longer or result in greater cost than anticipated is delay in market acceptance of and difficulty in transitioning new and existing customer to new enhanced or acquired product line or service there are change in information technology it trend that we do not adequately anticipate or address with our product development effort we do not optimize complementary product line and service in timely manner or we fail to adequately integrate support or enhance acquired product line or service our oracle cloud strategy including our oracle software service saas and infrastructure service iaa offering may adversely affect our revenue and profitability we provide our cloud and other offering to customer worldwide via deployment model that best suit their need including via our cloud based saas and iaa offering these business model continue to evolve we may not be able to compete effectively generate significant revenue or maintain the profitability of our cloud offering additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and saas delivery model offered by and our competitor may unfavorably impact the pricing of our cloud and license offering if we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing need of our customer our reputation cloud service provider could be harmed and our revenue and profitability could decline table of content index to financial statement customer demand for our cloud offering increase we experience volatility in our reported revenue and operating result due to the difference in timing of revenue recognition between our cloud license and on premise license and hardware product arrangement relative to our cloud offering arrangement customer generally purchase our cloud offering on subscription basis and revenue from these offering are generally recognized ratably over the term of the subscription consequently any deterioration in sale activity associated with our cloud offering may not be immediately observable in our consolidated statement of operation this is in contrast to revenue associated with our license and hardware product arrangement which are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of the related license and hardware product we have also acquired number of cloud computing company and the integration of these company into our oracle cloud strategy may not be efficient or scalable anticipated which could adversely affect our ability to fully realize the benefit anticipated from these acquisition we might experience significant coding manufacturing or configuration error in our cloud license and hardware offering despite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of product or service our cloud license and hardware offering sometimes contain coding or manufacturing error that can impact their function performance and security and result in other negative consequence the detection and correction of any error in released cloud license or hardware offering can be time consuming and costly error in our cloud license or hardware offering could affect their ability to properly function integrate or operate with other cloud license or hardware offering could delay the development or release of new product or service or new version of product or service could create security vulnerability in our product or service and could adversely affect market acceptance of our product or service this includes third party software product or service incorporated into our own if we experience error or delay in releasing our cloud license or hardware offering or new version of these offering our sale could be affected and revenue could decline in addition we run oracle business operation well cloud and other service that we offer to our customer on our product and network therefore any flaw could affect our and our customer ability to conduct business operation and to ensure accuracy in financial process and reporting and may result in unanticipated cost enterprise customer rely on our cloud license and hardware offering and related service to run their business and error in our cloud license and hardware offering and related service could expose to product liability performance and warranty claim well significant harm to our brand and reputation which could impact our future sale if our security measure for our product and service are compromised and result our data our customer data or our it system are accessed improperly made unavailable or improperly modified our product and service may be perceived vulnerable our brand and reputation could be damaged the it service we provide to our customer could be disrupted and customer may stop using our product and service all of which could reduce our revenue and earnings increase our expense and expose to legal claim and regulatory action we are in the it business and our product and service including our oracle cloud service store retrieve manipulate and manage our customer information and data external data well our own data we have reputation for secure and reliable product offering and related service and we have invested great deal of time and resource in protecting the integrity and security of our product service and the internal and external data that we manage at time we encounter attempt by third party which may include individual or group of hacker and sophisticated organization such state sponsored organization nation state and individual sponsored by them to identify and exploit product and service vulnerability penetrate or bypass our security measure and gain unauthorized access to our or our customer partner and supplier software hardware and cloud offering network and system any of which could lead to the compromise of personal information or the confidential information or data of oracle or our customer computer hacker and others may be able to develop and deploy it related virus worm and other malicious software program that could attack our network system product and service exploit potential security vulnerability of our network system product and service create system disruption and cause shutdown or denial of service this is also true for third party data product or service incorporated into our own our product and service including our oracle cloud service may also be accessed or modified improperly result of customer partner employee or supplier error or malfeasance and third party may attempt to fraudulently induce customer partner employee or supplier into disclosing sensitive information such user name password or other information in order to gain access to our data our customer supplier or partner data or the it system of oracle our customer supplier or partner table of content index to financial statement security industry expert and government official have warned about the risk of hacker and cyber attack targeting it product and business although this is an industry wide problem that affect software and hardware company generally it affect oracle in particular because computer hacker tend to focus their effort on the most prominent it company and they may focus on oracle because of our reputation for and marketing effort associated with having secure product and service these risk will increase we continue to grow our cloud offering and store and process increasingly large amount of data including personal information and our customer confidential information and data and host or manage part of our customer business in cloud based it environment especially in customer sector involving particularly sensitive data such health science financial service retail hospitality and the government we also have an active acquisition program and have acquired number of company product service and technology over the year while we make significant effort to address any it security issue with respect to our acquired company we may still inherit such risk when we integrate these company within oracle because the technique used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage it system change frequently grow more complex over time and often are not recognized until launched target we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measure to prevent against such technique our internal it system continue to evolve and we are often early adapter of new technology however our business policy and internal security control may not keep pace with these change new threat emerge in addition we may not discover any security breach and loss of information for significant period of time after the security breach we could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation if cyber attack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of our customer or supplier data other external data or our own data or our it system or if the service we provide to our customer were disrupted or if our product or service are reported to have or are perceived having security vulnerability customer could lose confidence in the security and reliability of our product and service including our cloud offering and perceive them to not be secure this could lead to fewer customer using our product and service and result in reduced revenue and earnings the cost we would incur to address and fix these security incident would increase our expense these type of security incident could also lead to loss or destruction of information inappropriate use of proprietary and sensitive data lawsuit indemnity obligation regulatory investigation and financial penalty and claim and increased legal liability including in some case contractual cost related to customer notification and fraud monitoring our product operate in conjunction with and are dependent on product and component across broad ecosystem if there is security vulnerability in one of these component and if there is security exploit targeting it we could face increased cost liability claim customer dissatisfaction reduced revenue or harm to our reputation or competitive position our business practice with respect to data could give rise to operational interruption liability or reputational harm result of governmental regulation legal requirement or industry standard relating to consumer privacy and data protection regulatory focus on privacy issue continues to increase and worldwide law and regulation concerning the handling of personal information expand and become more complex potential risk related to data collection and use within our business will intensify in addition and foreign government have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulation or may in the near future interpret existing legislation or regulation in manner that could significantly impact our ability well the ability of our customer partner and data provider to collect augment analyze use transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain service we provide for example certain data transfer mechanism are currently subject to challenge in european court which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfer to the or interruption of such transfer in the event any court block transfer to or from particular jurisdiction on the basis that no transfer mechanism are legally adequate this could give rise to operational interruption in the performance of service for customer and internal processing of employee information regulatory liability or reputational harm this impact could also occur in those jurisdiction where privacy law or regulator take broader view of how personal information is defined therefore subjecting the handling of such data to heightened restriction that may be obstructive to our operation and the operation of our customer partner and data provider this impact could be acute in country that have passed or are considering passing legislation that requires data to remain localized in country this imposes financial cost on any service provider that is required to store data in jurisdiction not of it choosing and nonstandard operational process that are difficult and costly to integrate with global process table of content index to financial statement in the wake of the european union general data protection regulation gdpr the rate of global consideration and adoption of privacy law ha increased giving rise to more global jurisdiction in which regulatory inquiry and audit may be requested of oracle and if not deemed to be in compliance could result in enforcement action and or fine this is true in the where california recently enacted the california consumer privacy act ccpa effective in january congress is considering several privacy bill at the federal level and other state legislature are considering privacy law regulator globally are also imposing greater monetary fine for privacy violation the gdpr which became effective in may provides for monetary penalty of up to of an organization worldwide revenue one european data protection regulator ha fined major technology company eur million for it data handling practice the federal trade commission continues to fine company on regular basis for unfair and deceptive data protection practice and these fine may increase in size the ccpa provides for statutory damage on per violation basis that could be large in the event of significant data security breach or other ccpa violation taken together the change in law or regulation associated with the enhanced protection of personal and other type of data could greatly increase the size of potential fine related to data protection and our cost of providing our product and service could result in change to our business practice or even prevent from offering certain service in jurisdiction in which we operate although we have implemented contract policy and procedure designed to ensure compliance with applicable law and regulation there can be no assurance that our employee contractor partner data provider or agent will not violate such law and regulation or our contract policy and procedure additionally public perception and standard related to the privacy of personal information can shift rapidly in way that may affect our reputation or influence regulator to enact regulation and law that may limit our ability to provide certain product we make statement about our use and disclosure of personal information through our privacy policy information provided on our website and press statement any failure or perceived failure by to comply with these public statement or with federal state or foreign law and regulation including law and regulation regulating privacy data security or consumer protection public perception standard self regulatory requirement or legal obligation could result in lost or restricted business proceeding action or fine brought against or levied by governmental entity or others or could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation economic political and market condition can adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability which in turn could adversely affect our stock price our business is influenced by range of factor that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting these include general economic and business condition overall demand for enterprise cloud license and hardware product and service governmental budgetary constraint or shift in government spending priority and general legal regulatory and political development macroeconomic development like the development associated with the united kingdom vote to exit the eu brexit evolving trade policy between the and international trade partner or the occurrence of similar event in other country that lead to uncertainty or instability in economic political or market condition could negatively affect our business operating result financial condition and outlook which in turn could adversely affect our stock price any general weakening of and related declining corporate confidence in the global economy or the curtailment of government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customer to reduce or eliminate their it budget and spending which could cause customer to delay decrease or cancel purchase of our product and service or cause customer not to pay or to delay paying for previously purchased product and service table of content index to financial statement in addition international regional or domestic political unrest and the related potential impact on global stability terrorist attack and the potential for other hostility in various part of the world potential public health crisis and natural disaster continue to contribute to climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability these factor generally have the strongest effect on our sale of cloud license and on premise license hardware and related service and to lesser extent also may affect our renewal rate for license support and our subscription based cloud offering if we are unable to compete effectively the result of operation and prospect for our business could be harmed we face intense competition in all aspect of our business the nature of the it industry creates competitive landscape that is constantly evolving firm emerge expand or are acquired technology evolves and delivery model change many vendor spend amount in excess of oracle spends to develop and market application and infrastructure technology including database middleware product application development tool business application collaboration product and business intelligence compute storage and networking product among others which compete with oracle application and infrastructure offering use of our competitor technology may influence customer purchasing decision or create an environment that make it le efficient to utilize or migrate to oracle product and service our competition may also adopt business practice that provide customer access to competing product and service at risk profile that we may not generally find acceptable which may convince customer to purchase competitor product and service we could lose customer if our competitor introduce new competitive product add new functionality acquire competitive product reduce price better execute on their sale and marketing strategy offer more flexible business practice or form strategic alliance with other company we may also face increasing competition from open source software initiative in which competitor may provide software and intellectual property for free existing or new competitor could gain sale opportunity or customer at our expense we may need to change our pricing model to compete successfully the intense competition we face in the sale of our product and service and general economic and business condition can put pressure on to change our price if our competitor offer deep discount on certain product or service or develop product that the marketplace considers more valuable we may need to lower price or offer other favorable term in order to compete successfully any such change may reduce margin and could adversely affect operating result additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud delivery model offered by and our competitor may unfavorably impact the pricing of our other cloud and license hardware and service offering and we may also incur increased cloud delivery expense we expand our cloud operation and update our infrastructure all of which could reduce our revenue and or profitability our license support fee and hardware support fee are generally priced percentage of our net license fee and net new hardware product fee respectively our competitor may offer lower pricing on their support offering which could put pressure on to further discount our offering we introduced oracle bring own license byol and universal credit pricing to simplify the way customer purchase and consume our cloud service oracle byol enables customer to maintain their existing software license for oracle infrastructure while expanding their platform technology footprint at discounted price oracle universal credit pricing provides flexible model for customer to access oracle infrastructure service on demand via single contract any future change to our price and pricing policy could cause our revenue to decline or be delayed our sale force implement and our customer adjust to the new pricing policy some of our competitor may bundle product for promotional purpose or long term pricing strategy commit to large customer deployment at price that are unprofitable or provide guarantee of price and product implementation these practice could over time significantly constrain the price that we can charge for certain of our product if we do not adapt our pricing model to reflect change in customer use of our product or change in customer demand our revenue could decrease the increase in open source software distribution may also cause to change our pricing model table of content index to financial statement our international sale and operation subject to additional risk that can adversely affect our operating result we derive substantial portion of our revenue from and have significant operation outside of the our international operation include cloud operation cloud software and hardware development manufacturing assembly sale customer support consulting and other service and shared administrative service center compliance with international and law and regulation that apply to our international operation increase our cost of business in foreign jurisdiction these law and regulation include law and local law which include data privacy requirement labor relation law tax law foreign currency related regulation anti competition regulation prohibition on payment to governmental official market access tariff import export and general trade regulation including but not limited to economic sanction and embargo violation of these law and regulation could result in fine and penalty criminal sanction against our officer or our employee and prohibition on the conduct of our business including the loss of trade privilege any such violation could result in prohibition on our ability to offer our product and service in one or more country could delay or prevent potential acquisition and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion effort our ability to attract and retain employee our business and our operating result compliance with these law requires significant amount of management attention and effort which may divert management attention from running our business operation and could harm our ability to grow our business or may increase our expense we engage specialized or other additional resource to assist with our compliance effort our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risk and manage these difficulty we monitor our operation and investigate allegation of impropriety relating to transaction and the way in which such transaction are recorded where circumstance warrant we provide information and report our finding to government authority but no assurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authority we are also subject to variety of other risk and challenge in managing an organization operating globally including those related to general economic condition in each country or region fluctuation in currency exchange rate and related impact on customer demand and our operating result difficulty in transferring fund from or converting currency in certain country that could lead to devaluation of our net asset in particular our cash asset in that country currency regulatory change including government austerity measure in certain country that we may not be able to sufficiently plan for or avoid that may unexpectedly impair bank deposit or other cash asset that we hold in these country or that impose additional tax that we may be required to pay in these country political unrest terrorism and the potential for other hostility common local business behavior that are in direct conflict with our business ethic practice and conduct policy natural disaster the effect of climate change such sea level rise drought flooding wildfire and increased storm sensitivity longer payment cycle and difficulty in collecting account receivable overlapping tax regime public health risk social risk and supporting infrastructure stability risk particularly in area in which we have significant operation and reduced protection for intellectual property right in some country table of content index to financial statement the variety of risk and challenge listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the supply chain operation for our hardware business and the sale of our product and service in affected country or region the majority shareholder of oracle financial service software limited publicly traded company in india and oracle corporation japan publicly traded company in japan we are faced with several additional risk including being subject to local security regulation and being unable to exert full control that we would otherwise have if these entity were wholly owned subsidiary any failure to offer high quality technical support service may adversely affect our relationship with our customer and our financial result our customer depend on our support organization to resolve technical issue relating to our application and infrastructure offering we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short term increase in customer demand for support service increased customer demand for these service without corresponding revenue could increase cost and adversely affect our operating result any failure to maintain high quality technical support or market perception that we do not maintain high quality technical support could adversely affect our reputation our ability to sell our application to existing and prospective customer and our business operating result and financial position we may fail to achieve our financial forecast due to inaccurate sale forecast or other factor our revenue particularly certain of our cloud license and on premise license revenue and hardware revenue can be difficult to forecast result our quarterly operating result can fluctuate for our oracle cloud service our actual conversion or renewal rate may differ from those used in our forecast because this business is continuing to evolve and such rate may be unpredictable which could have an adverse effect on our long term result for our license business we use pipeline system common industry practice to forecast sale and trend in that business our sale personnel monitor the status of all proposal and estimate when customer will make purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale these estimate are aggregated periodically to generate sale pipeline our pipeline estimate can be unreliable both in particular quarter and over longer period of time in part because the conversion rate or closure rate of the pipeline into contract can be very difficult to estimate reduction in the conversion rate renewal rate or in the pipeline could adversely affect our business or result of operation in particular slowdown in it spending or economic condition generally can unexpectedly reduce the conversion rate and renewal rate in particular period purchasing decision are delayed reduced in amount or cancelled the conversion rate can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customer to wait until the end of fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favorable term which can also impede our ability to negotiate execute and deliver upon these contract in timely manner in addition for newly acquired company we have limited ability to predict how their pipeline will convert into sale or revenue for number of quarter following the acquisition conversion rate and renewal rate post acquisition may be quite different from the acquired company historical conversion rate difference in conversion rate and renewal rate can also be affected by change in business practice that we implement in our newly acquired company these change may negatively affect customer behavior substantial portion of the revenue value of our cloud license and on premise license and hardware contract is completed in the latter part of quarter and significant percentage of these are larger value order because significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term sale and revenue shortfall tend to have disproportionately negative impact on our profitability the number of large license transaction and to lesser extent hardware product transaction increase the risk of fluctuation in our quarterly result because delay in even small number of these transaction could cause our quarterly sale revenue and profitability to fall significantly short of our prediction table of content index to financial statement we may experience foreign currency gain and loss change in currency exchange rate can adversely affect customer demand and our revenue and profitability we conduct significant number of transaction and hold cash in currency other than the dollar change in the value of major foreign currency particularly the euro japanese yen and british pound relative to the dollar can significantly affect our total asset revenue operating result and cash flow which are reported in dollar in particular the economic uncertainty relating to brexit and european sovereign and other debt obligation may cause the value of the british pound and euro to fluctuate relative to the dollar fluctuation in foreign currency rate including the strengthening of the dollar against the euro and most other major international currency adversely affect our revenue growth in term of the amount that we report in dollar after converting our foreign currency result into dollar and in term of actual demand for our product and service certain of these product may become relatively more expensive for foreign currency based enterprise to purchase in addition currency variation can adversely affect margin on sale of our product in country outside of the generally our reported revenue and operating result are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currency and are positively affected when the dollar weakens in addition our reported asset generally are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currency portion of our consolidated cash and bank deposit among other asset are held in foreign currency in addition we incur foreign currency transaction gain and loss primarily related to sublicense fee and other intercompany agreement among and our subsidiary that we expect to cash settle in the near term which are charged against earnings in the period incurred we have program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contract designed to offset the risk associated with certain foreign currency exposure we may suspend the program from time to time part of this program we enter into foreign currency forward contract so that increase or decrease in our foreign currency exposure are offset at least in part by gain or loss on the foreign currency forward contract in an effort to mitigate the risk and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gain or loss large portion of our consolidated operation are international and we expect that we will continue to realize gain or loss with respect to our foreign currency exposure net of gain or loss from our foreign currency forward contract for example we will experience foreign currency gain and loss in certain instance if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our foreign currency exposure if our hedging effort are ineffective or should we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuation will generally depend on the size and type of cross currency exposure that we enter into the currency exchange rate associated with these exposure and change in those rate whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contract to offset these exposure and other factor all of these factor could materially impact our result of operation financial position and cash flow we have incurred foreign currency loss associated with the devaluation of currency in certain highly inflationary economy relative to the dollar we could incur future loss in emerging market country where we do business should their currency become designated highly inflationary our periodic workforce restructurings and reorganization can be disruptive we have in the past restructured or made other adjustment to our workforce in response to management change product change performance issue change in strategy acquisition and other internal and external consideration in the past these type of restructurings have resulted in increased restructuring cost and temporary reduced productivity while the employee adjusted to their new role and responsibility in addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth resource redeployment or cost saving benefit of these restructurings or may not do so within the expected timeframe these effect could recur in connection with future acquisition and other restructurings and our revenue and other result of operation could be negatively affected table of content index to financial statement we may lose key employee or may be unable to hire enough qualified employee we rely on hiring qualified employee and the continued service of our senior management including our chairman of the board of director chief technology officer and founder our chief executive officer other member of our executive team and other key employee in the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business product development technical and other personnel we may also experience increased compensation cost that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sale we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel with rare exception we do not have long term employment or non competition agreement with our employee member of our senior management team have left oracle over the year for variety of reason and we can not guarantee that there will not be additional departure which may be disruptive to our operation we continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in country where advanced technical expertise and other expertise are available at lower cost when we make adjustment to our workforce we may incur expense associated with workforce reduction that delay the benefit of more efficient workforce structure we may also experience increased competition for employee in these country the trend toward globalization continues which may affect our employee retention effort and increase our expense in an effort to offer competitive compensation program in addition change to immigration and labor law policy may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent our general compensation program includes restricted stock unit and performance based equity which are important tool in attracting and retaining employee in our industry if our stock price performs poorly it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employee we continually evaluate our compensation practice and consider change from time to time such reducing the number of employee granted equity award or the number of equity award granted per employee and granting alternative form of stock based compensation which may have an impact on our ability to retain employee and the amount of stock based compensation expense that we record any change in our compensation practice or those of our

negatively impact our potential for growth in the government sector we are also subject to early termination of our contract many governmental entity have the right to terminate contract at any time without cause for example the federal government may terminate any of our government contract and subcontract at it convenience or for default based on our performance federal contract are subject to the congressional approval of appropriation to fund the expenditure under these contract similarly our contract with state and local government foreign government and their agency are generally subject to government funding authorization contract may be terminated based upon lack of appropriated fund there is increased pressure on government and their agency both domestically and internationally to reduce spending government continue to face significant deficit reduction pressure this may adversely impact spending on government program government contract law and regulation impose certain risk and contract are generally subject to audit and investigation if violation of law are found they could result in civil and criminal penalty and administrative sanction including

company product service and technology we have selective and active acquisition program and we expect to continue to make acquisition in the future because acquisition are an important element of our overall corporate strategy risk we may face in connection with our acquisition program include our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management attention may be diverted by acquisition transition or integration activity we may have difficulty managing an acquired company technology or line of business entering new market where we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitor may have stronger market position or retaining key personnel from the acquired company an acquisition may not further our business strategy we expected we may not integrate an acquired company or technology successfully we expected we may impose our business practice or alter go to market strategy that adversely impact the acquired business or we may overpay for or otherwise not realize the expected return on our investment which could adversely affect our business or operating result and potentially cause impairment to asset that we recorded part of an acquisition including intangible asset and goodwill our operating result or financial condition may be adversely impacted by claim or liability that we assume from an acquired company or technology or that are otherwise related to an acquisition including among others claim from government agency terminated employee current or former customer former stockholder or other third party pre existing contractual relationship that we assume from an acquired company that we would not have otherwise entered into the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment result of an acquired company practice and intellectual property claim or dispute we may fail to identify or ass the magnitude of certain liability shortcoming or other circumstance prior to acquiring company or technology which could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure unfavorable accounting treatment unexpected increase in tax due the loss of anticipated tax benefit or other adverse effect on our business operating result or financial condition we may not realize any anticipated increase in our revenue from an acquisition for number of reason including if larger than predicted number of customer decline to renew cloud based subscription contract or license support or hardware support contract if we are unable to sell the acquired product or service offering to our customer base if acquired customer do not elect to purchase our technology due to differing business practice or if contract model utilized by an acquired company do not allow to recognize revenue on timely basis we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technology product service and their related supply chain operation with our existing line of business and supply chain infrastructure and maintaining uniform standard architecture control procedure and policy we may have multiple product line or service offering result of our acquisition that are offered priced delivered and supported differently which could cause customer confusion and delay we may incur higher than anticipated cost to support develop and deliver acquired product or service for general and administrative function that support new business model or to comply with regulation applicable to an acquired business that are more complicated than we anticipated we may be unable to obtain timely approval from or may otherwise have certain limitation restriction penalty or other sanction imposed on by worker council or similar body under applicable employment law result of an acquisition which could adversely affect our integration plan in certain jurisdiction and potentially increase our integration and restructuring expense table of content index to financial statement we may be unable to obtain required approval from governmental authority under competition and antitrust law on timely basis if at all which could among other thing delay or prevent from completing transaction adversely affect our integration plan in certain jurisdiction restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goal of an acquisition or have other adverse effect on our current business and operation our use of cash to pay for acquisition may limit other potential us of our cash including stock repurchase dividend payment and retirement of outstanding indebtedness among others we may significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirement if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition and we may have to delay or not proceed with substantial acquisition if we can not obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in timely manner or on favorable term to the extent that we issue significant amount of equity security in connection with future acquisition existing stockholder may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease and we may experience additional or unexpected change in how we are required to account for our acquisition pursuant to generally accepted accounting principle including arrangement that we may assume in an acquisition the occurrence of any of these risk could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition or cash flow particularly in the case of larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisition our hardware revenue and profitability have declined and could continue to decline our hardware business may adversely affect our overall profitability we may not achieve our estimated revenue profit or other financial projection with respect to our hardware business in timely manner or at all due to number of factor including our change in hardware strategy offering and technology which could adversely affect demand for our hardware product our hardware business ha higher expense percentage of revenue and thus ha been le profitable than our cloud and license business our focus on our more profitable oracle engineered system and the de emphasis of our lower profit margin commodity hardware product could adversely affect our hardware revenue change in strategy and frequency for the development and introduction of new version or next generation of our hardware product could adversely affect our hardware revenue greater risk of material charge that could adversely affect our operating result such potential write down and impairment of our inventory higher warranty expense than what we experience in our cloud and license and service business and amortization and potential impairment of intangible asset associated with our hardware business decreased customer demand for related hardware support hardware product approach the end of their useful life could adversely affect our hardware revenue and we may acquire hardware company that are strategically important to but operate in hardware business with historically lower operating margin than our own have different legacy business practice and go to market strategy than our own that we may alter part of our integration effort which may significantly impact our estimated revenue and profit from the acquired company leverage different platform or competing technology that we may encounter difficulty in integrating or utilize unique manufacturing process that affect our ability to scale these acquired product within our own manufacturing operation table of content index to financial statement our hardware offering are complex product and if we can not successfully manage this complexity the result of our hardware business will suffer we depend on supplier to develop manufacture and deliver on timely basis the necessary technology and component for our hardware product and there are some technology and component that can only be purchased from single vendor due to price quality technology availability or other business constraint result our supply chain operation could be disrupted or negatively impacted by industry consolidation and component constraint or shortage natural disaster political unrest port stoppage or other transportation disruption or slowdown or other factor affecting the country or region where these single source component vendor are located or where the product are being shipped we may be unable to purchase these item from the respective single vendor on acceptable term or may experience significant shortage delay or quality issue in the delivery of necessary technology part or component from particular vendor if one or more of the risk described above occurs our hardware business and related operating result could be materially and adversely affected we are susceptible to third party manufacturing and logistics delay which could result in the loss of sale and customer we outsource the manufacturing assembly delivery and technology or component design of certain of our hardware product to variety of company many of which are located outside the if these partner experience production problem or delay or can not meet our demand for product we may not be able to find alternate manufacturing source in timely or cost effective manner if at all therefore we continue to explore additional third party manufacturing partner to drive supply chain continuity this could cause the loss of sale and existing or potential customer delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware product expense all of which could adversely affect the margin of our hardware business these challenge and risk also exist when we acquire company with hardware product and related supply chain operation in some case we may be dependent at least initially on these acquired company supply chain operation that we are le familiar with and thus we may be slower to adjust or react to these challenge and risk our cloud and license and hardware indirect sale channel could affect our future operating result our cloud and license and hardware indirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers system integrator implementers consultant education provider internet service provider network integrator and independent software vendor our relationship with these channel participant are important element of our cloud software and hardware marketing and sale effort our financial result could be adversely affected if our contract with channel participant were terminated if our relationship with channel participant were to deteriorate if any of our competitor enter into strategic relationship with or acquire significant channel participant if the financial condition or operation of our channel participant were to weaken or if the level of demand for our channel participant product and service were to decrease there can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining expanding or developing our relationship with channel participant if we are not successful we may lose sale opportunity customer and revenue we may not be able to protect our intellectual property right we rely on copyright trademark patent and trade secret law confidentiality procedure control and contractual commitment to protect our intellectual property right despite our effort these protection may be limited unauthorized third party may try to copy or reverse engineer portion of our product or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property any patent owned by may be invalidated circumvented or challenged any of our pending or future patent application whether or not being currently challenged may not be issued with the scope of the claim we seek if at all in addition the law of some country do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property right do the law and court of the if we can not protect our intellectual property right against unauthorized copying or use or other misappropriation we may not remain competitive table of content index to financial statement third party have claimed and in the future may claim infringement or misuse of intellectual property right and or breach of license agreement provision we periodically receive notice from or have lawsuit filed against by others claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property right and or breach of our agreement with them these third party include entity that do not have the capability to design manufacture or distribute product or service or that acquire intellectual property like patent for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claim of infringement and misuse we expect to continue to receive such claim we continue to expand into new business and acquire company the number of product and competitor in our industry segment grows the use and support of third party code including open source code becomes more prevalent in the industry the volume of issued patent continues to increase and non practicing entity continue to assert intellectual property infringement in our industry segment responding to any such claim regardless of it validity could be time consuming costly and result in litigation divert management time and attention from developing our business require to pay monetary damage or enter into royalty and licensing agreement that we would not normally find acceptable require to stop selling or to redesign certain of our product require to release source code to third party possibly under open source license term require to satisfy indemnification obligation to our customer or otherwise adversely affect our business result of operation financial condition or cash flow we may not receive significant revenue from our current research and development effort for several year if at all developing our various product offering is expensive and the investment in the development of these offering often involves long return on investment cycle an important element of our corporate strategy is to continue to dedicate significant amount of resource to research and development and related product and service opportunity both through internal investment and the acquisition of intellectual property from company that we have acquired accelerated product and service introduction and short life cycle require high level of expenditure for research and development that could adversely affect our operating result if not offset by revenue increase we believe that we must continue to dedicate significant amount of resource to our research and development effort to maintain our competitive position however we do not expect to receive significant revenue from these investment for several year if at all business disruption could adversely affect our operating result significant portion of our critical business operation are concentrated in geographic area some of which include emerging market international location that may be le stable relative to running such business operation solely within the we are highly automated business and disruption or failure of our system and process could cause delay in completing sale providing service including some of our cloud offering and enabling seamless customer experience with respect to our customer facing back office process major earthquake or fire political social or other disruption to infrastructure that support our operation or other catastrophic event or the effect of climate change such increased storm severity drought and pandemic that result in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it system could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operation and result our future operating result could be materially and adversely affected table of content index to financial statement adverse litigation result could affect our business we are subject to various legal proceeding litigation can be lengthy expensive and disruptive to our operation and can divert our management attention away from running our core business the result of our litigation also can not be predicted with certainty an adverse decision could result in monetary damage or injunctive relief that could affect our business operating result or financial condition additional information regarding certain of the lawsuit we are involved in is discussed under note of note to consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report we may have exposure to additional tax liability multinational corporation we are subject to income tax well non income based tax in both the and various foreign jurisdiction significant uncertainty exist with respect to the amount of our tax liability including those arising from potential change in law in the country in which we do business and the possibility of adverse determination with respect to the application of existing law many judgment are required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax and other tax liability and we are regularly under audit by tax authority which often do not agree with position taken by on our tax return any unfavorable resolution of these uncertainty may have significant adverse impact on our tax rate increasingly country around the world are actively considering or have enacted change in relevant tax accounting and other law regulation and interpretation in particular the tax cut and job act of the tax act significantly changed how corporation are taxed in the which ha had and we expect will continue to have meaningful impact on our provision for income tax due to the complexity involved in applying the provision of the tax act we made reasonable estimate of the effect and recorded provisional amount in our financial statement for the year ended may the treasury department and the internal revenue service irs and other standard setting body may issue guidance on how the provision of the tax act will be applied that is different from our interpretation the tax act requires complex computation not previously required or produced and significant judgment and assumption in the interpretation of the law were made in producing our provisional estimate we have adjusted the provisional amount and reflected the adjustment in our financial statement for the year ended may based on the regulatory and other guidance issued to date by the treasury department and irs but also on judgment and assumption where uncertainty continues to exist such uncertainty in the application of the tax act to our ongoing operation well possible adverse future law change attributable to change in the political environment could have an adverse impact on our future tax rate other country also continue to consider enacting change to their tax law that could adversely affect by increasing tax imposed on our foreign subsidiary including change in withholding tax regime and the imposition of tax targeted at certain technology business more fundamentally longstanding international tax principle that determine each country right to tax cross border transaction are being reconsidered creating significant uncertainty to the future level of corporate income tax on our international operation this examination is driven by perceived need to provide greater taxing right to market jurisdiction where customer or user are located various measure are being discussed including adjustment to transfer pricing rule limitation on deduction and imposition of additional withholding tax part of our income tax structure there are many intercompany transaction and calculation made in the ordinary course of business where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our intercompany transfer pricing ha been and is currently being reviewed by the irs and by foreign tax jurisdiction and will likely be subject to additional audit in the future although we have negotiated number of agreement with certain taxing jurisdiction these agreement do not cover substantial element of our transfer pricing in recent period transfer pricing audit in many foreign jurisdiction have become increasingly contentious similarly certain jurisdiction are increasingly raising concern about certain withholding tax matter under current law in addition our provision for income tax could be adversely affected by shift of earnings from jurisdiction or regime that have relatively lower statutory tax rate to those in which the rate are relatively higher table of content index to financial statement we are also subject to non income based tax such payroll sale use value added net worth property and good and service tax in both the and various foreign jurisdiction that have uncertain applicability to the business in which we are engaged although we believe that our income and non income based tax estimate are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audit or tax dispute will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accrual charge to earnings resulting from acquisition may adversely affect our operating result under business combination accounting standard pursuant to accounting standard codification asc business combination we recognize the identifiable asset acquired the liability assumed and any non controlling interest in acquired company generally at their acquisition date fair value and in each case separately from goodwill goodwill of the acquisition date is measured the excess amount of consideration transferred which is also generally measured at fair value and the net of the acquisition date amount of the identifiable asset acquired and the liability assumed our estimate of fair value are based upon assumption believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain after we complete an acquisition the following factor could result in material charge and adversely affect our operating result and may adversely affect our cash flow cost incurred to combine the operation of company we acquire such transitional employee expense and employee retention redeployment or relocation expense impairment of goodwill or impairment of intangible asset amortization of intangible asset acquired reduction in the useful life of intangible asset acquired identification of or change to assumed contingent liability both income tax and non income tax related after our final determination of the amount for these contingency or the conclusion of the measurement period generally up to one year from the acquisition date whichever come first charge to our operating result to maintain certain duplicative pre merger activity for an extended period of time or to maintain these activity for period of time that is longer than we had anticipated charge to eliminate certain duplicative pre merger activity and charge to restructure our operation or to reduce our cost structure charge to our operating result due to expense incurred to effect the acquisition and charge to our operating result due to the expensing of certain stock award assumed in an acquisition substantially all of these cost will be accounted for expense that will adversely impact our operating result for the period in which those cost are incurred charge to our operating result in any given period could differ substantially from other period based on the timing and size of our future acquisition and the extent of integration

of refinancing result in higher interest rate upon refinancing the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase should we incur future increase in interest expense our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credit to reduce our federal income tax could be limited which could unfavorably affect our provision for income tax and effective tax rate in addition

significant trend this overview is followed by summary of our critical accounting policy and estimate that we believe are important to understanding the assumption and judgment incorporated in our reported financial result we then provide more detailed analysis of our result of operation and financial condition business overview oracle provides product and service that address enterprise information technology it environment our product and service include application and infrastructure offering that are delivered worldwide through variety of flexible and interoperable it deployment model these model include on premise deployment cloud based deployment and hybrid deployment an approach that combine both on premise and cloud based deployment such our oracle cloud at customer offering an instance of oracle cloud in customer own data center accordingly we offer choice and flexibility to our customer and facilitate the product service and deployment combination that best suit our customer need our customer include business of many size government agency educational institution and resellers that we market and sell to directly through our worldwide sale force and indirectly through the oracle partner network we have three business cloud and license hardware and service each of which comprises single operating segment the description set forth below part of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation and the information contained within note of note to consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report provide additional information related to our business and operating segment and align to how our chief operating decision maker codms which include our chief executive officer and chief technology officer view our operating result and allocate resource cloud and license business our cloud and license line of business which represented and of our total revenue in fiscal and respectively market sell and delivers broad spectrum of application and infrastructure technology through our cloud and license offering cloud service and license support revenue include license support revenue which are earned by providing oracle license support service to customer that have elected to purchase support service in connection with the purchase of oracle application and infrastructure software license for use in cloud on premise and other it environment substantially all license support customer renew their support contract with upon expiration in order to continue to benefit from technical support service and the periodic issuance of unspecified update and enhancement which current license support customer are entitled to receive license support contract are generally priced percentage of the net fee paid by the customer to purchase cloud license and or on premise license are generally billed in advance of the support service being performed are generally renewed at the customer option and are generally recognized revenue ratably over the contractual period that the support service are provided which is generally one year and cloud service revenue which provide customer access to oracle cloud application and infrastructure technology via cloud based deployment model that oracle develops provides unspecified update and enhancement for host manages and support and that customer access by entering into subscription agreement with for stated period the majority of our oracle cloud service arrangement are generally billed in advance of the cloud service being performed have duration of one to three year are generally renewed at the customer option and are generally recognized revenue ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or in the case of usage model contract the cloud service are consumed over time table of content index to financial statement cloud license and on premise license revenue include revenue from the licensing of our software product including oracle application oracle database oracle middleware and java among others which our customer deploy within cloud based on premise and other it environment our cloud license and on premise license transaction are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use revenue from usage based royalty arrangement for distinct cloud license and on premise license are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs the timing of few large license transaction can substantially affect our quarterly license revenue due to the point in time for revenue recognition of license transaction which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud service and license support revenue in which revenue are generally recognized ratably over the contractual term cloud license and on premise license customer have the option to purchase and renew license support contract described above providing choice and flexibility to our customer to when and how they deploy our application and infrastructure technology is an important element of our corporate strategy in recent period customer demand for our application and infrastructure technology delivered through our oracle cloud service ha increased to address customer demand and enable customer choice we have introduced certain program for customer to pivot their application and infrastructure license and the related license support to the oracle cloud for new deployment and to migrate to and expand with the oracle cloud for their existing workload we expect these trend to continue our cloud and license business revenue growth is affected by many factor including the strength of general economic and business condition governmental budgetary constraint the strategy for and competitive position of our offering our acquisition the continued renewal of our cloud service and license support customer contract by the customer contract base substantially all customer continuing to purchase license support contract in connection with their license purchase the pricing of license support contract sold in connection with the sale of license the pricing amount and volume of license and cloud service sold and foreign currency rate fluctuation on constant currency basis we expect that our total cloud and license revenue generally will continue to increase due to expected growth in our cloud service and license support offering continued demand for our cloud license and on premise license offering and contribution from our acquisition we believe all of these factor should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license revenue which should enable to continue to make investment in research and development to develop and improve our cloud and license product and service our cloud and license business margin ha historically trended upward over the course of the four quarter within particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business revenue over those quarterly period and because the majority of our cost for this business are generally fixed in the short term the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business revenue over the course of the four quarter within particular fiscal year is primarily due to the addition of new cloud service and license support contract to the customer contract base that we generally recognize revenue ratably the renewal of existing customer cloud service and license support contract over the course of each fiscal year that we generally recognize revenue ratably and the historical upward trend of our cloud license and on premise license revenue which we generally recognize at point in time upon delivery over those four quarterly period hardware business our hardware business which represented and of our total revenue in fiscal and respectively provides broad selection of hardware product and hardware related software product including oracle engineered system server storage industry specific hardware operating system virtualization table of content index to financial statement management and other hardware related software and related hardware support each hardware product and it related software such an operating system or firmware are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for combined performance obligation the revenue for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product and it related software are delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer we expect to make investment in research and development to improve existing hardware product and service and to develop new hardware product and service the majority of our hardware product are sold through indirect channel including independent distributor and value added resellers our hardware support offering provide customer with unspecified software update for software component that are essential to the functionality of our hardware product and associated software product such oracle solaris our hardware support offering can also include product repair maintenance service and technical support service hardware support contract are entered into and renewed at the option of the customer are generally priced percentage of the net hardware product fee and are generally recognized revenue ratably the hardware support service are delivered over the contractual term we generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margin percentage of revenue than our cloud and license business due to the incremental cost we incur to produce and distribute these product and to provide support service including direct material and labor cost our quarterly hardware revenue are difficult to predict our hardware revenue cost of hardware and hardware operating margin that we report are affected by among others our ability to timely manufacture or deliver few large hardware transaction our strategy for and the position of our hardware product relative to competitor offering customer demand for competing offering including iaa the strength of general economic and business condition governmental budgetary constraint whether customer decide to purchase hardware support contract at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale the percentage of our hardware support contract

oracle application and infrastructure technology we believe that our service are differentiated based on our focus on oracle technology extensive experience broad set of intellectual property and best practice our service offering include consulting service advanced customer support service and education service our service business ha lower margin than our cloud and license and hardware business our service revenue are impacted by among others our strategy for and the competitive position of our service customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offering and the associated service for these offering certain of our acquisition general economic condition governmental budgetary constraint personnel reduction in our customer it department and tighter control over customer discretionary spending acquisition our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy in recent year we have invested billion of dollar to acquire number of complementary company product service and technology including netsuite in fiscal we expect to continue to acquire company product service and technology in furtherance of our corporate strategy note of note to consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report provides additional information related to our recent acquisition we believe that we can fund our future acquisition with our internally available cash cash equivalent and marketable security cash generated from operation additional borrowing or from the issuance of additional table of content index to financial statement security we estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings operating margin cash flow and return on invested capital target before deciding to move forward with an acquisition critical accounting policy and estimate our consolidated financial statement are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle gaap set forth in the financial accounting standard board fasb asc and we consider the various staff accounting bulletin and other applicable guidance issued by the sec note of note to consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report includes description of our significant accounting policy gaap set forth within the asc requires to make certain estimate judgment and assumption we apply our significant accounting policy the accounting policy that reflect estimate judgment and assumption that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial result and for which we include additional discussion below are revenue recognition business combination goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessment accounting for income tax and legal and other contingency our senior management ha reviewed our critical accounting policy and related disclosure with the finance and audit committee of the board of director revenue recognition the most critical judgment required in applying topic and our revenue recognition policy relate to the determination of distinct performance obligation and the evaluation of the standalone selling price ssp for each performance obligation many of our customer contract include multiple performance obligation judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation within customer contract is distinct oracle product and service generally do not require significant amount of integration or interdependency therefore multiple product and service contained within customer contract are generally considered to be distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purpose we allocate the transaction price for each customer contract to each performance obligation based on the relative ssp the determination of ssp is discussed below for each performance obligation within each contract we recognize the amount of transaction price allocated to each performance obligation within customer contract revenue each performance obligation is delivered we use judgment in determining the ssp for product and service for substantially all performance obligation except cloud license and on premise license we are able to establish the ssp based on the observable price of product or service sold separately in comparable circumstance to similar customer we typically establish an ssp range for our product and service which is reassessed on periodic basis or when fact and circumstance change ssp for our product and service can evolve over time due to change in our pricing practice that are influenced by intense competition change in demand for our product and service and economic factor among others our cloud license and on premise license have not historically been sold on standalone basis substantially all customer elect to purchase license support contract at the time of cloud license and on premise license purchase license support contract are generally priced percentage of the net fee paid by the customer to access the license we are unable to establish the ssp for our cloud license and on premise license based on observable price given the same product are sold for broad range of amount that is the selling price is highly variable and representative ssp is not discernible from past transaction or other observable evidence result the ssp for cloud license and an on premise license included in contract with multiple performance obligation is determined by applying residual approach whereby all other performance table of content index to financial statement obligation within contract are first allocated portion of the transaction price based upon their respective ssps with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and on premise license revenue business combination we apply the provision of asc business combination in accounting for our acquisition asc requires that we evaluate whether transaction pertains to an acquisition of asset or to an acquisition of business business is defined an integrated set of asset and activity that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing return to investor asset acquisition are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual asset and liability assumed on relative fair value basis whereas the acquisition of business requires to recognize separately from goodwill the asset acquired and the liability assumed at the acquisition date fair value goodwill of the acquisition date is measured the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair value of the asset acquired and the liability assumed while we use our best estimate and assumption to accurately value asset acquired and liability assumed at the acquisition date well any contingent consideration where applicable our estimate are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustment to the asset acquired and liability assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the value of asset acquired or liability assumed whichever come first any subsequent adjustment are recorded to our consolidated statement of operation accounting for business combination requires our management to make significant estimate and assumption especially at the acquisition date including our estimate for intangible asset contractual obligation assumed pre acquisition contingency and any contingent consideration where applicable although we believe that the assumption and estimate we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain unanticipated event and circumstance may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumption estimate or actual result for given acquisition we may identify certain pre acquisition contingency of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre acquisition contingency throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to ass whether we include these contingency part of the fair value estimate of asset acquired and liability assumed and if so to determine their estimated amount if we can not reasonably determine the fair value of non income tax related pre acquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period which is generally the case given the nature of such matter we will recognize an asset or liability for such pre acquisition contingency if it is probable that an asset existed or liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated subsequent to the measurement period change in our estimate of such contingency will affect earnings and could have material effect on our result of operation and financial position in addition uncertain tax position and tax related valuation allowance assumed in connection with business combination are initially estimated of the acquisition date we reevaluate these item quarterly based upon fact and circumstance that existed of the acquisition date with any adjustment to our preliminary estimate being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance or contingency estimated value whichever come first change to these uncertain tax position and tax related valuation allowance will affect our provision for income tax in our consolidated statement of operation and could have material impact on our result of operation and financial position goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessment we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever event or change in circumstance indicate it carrying value may not be recoverable we make certain judgment and assumption to determine our reporting unit and in allocating shared asset and liability to determine the carrying value for each of our reporting unit table of content index to financial statement judgment in the assessment of qualitative factor of impairment include cost factor financial performance legal regulatory contractual political business and other factor entity specific factor industry and market consideration macroeconomic condition and other relevant event and factor affecting the reporting unit to the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is le than it carrying value quantitative test is then performed determining the fair value of reporting unit involves the use of significant estimate and assumption these estimate and assumption include among others revenue growth rate and operating margin used to calculate projected future cash flow risk adjusted discount rate future economic and market condition and the determination of appropriate market comparables we make judgment about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible asset whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that impairment may exist in such situation we are required to evaluate whether the net book value of our finite lived intangible asset are recoverable we determine whether finite lived intangible asset are recoverable based upon the forecasted future cash flow that are expected to be generated by the lowest level associated asset grouping assumption and estimate about future value and remaining useful life of our intangible asset are complex and subjective and include among others forecasted undiscounted cash flow to be generated by certain asset grouping these assumption and estimate can be affected by variety of factor including external factor such industry and economic trend and internal factor such change in our business strategy and our internal forecast accounting for income tax judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision in the ordinary course of global business there are many transaction and calculation where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainty arise consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangement among related entity the process of identifying item of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment and the segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expense to avoid double taxation although we believe that our estimate are reasonable the final tax outcome of these matter could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accrual such difference could have material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made we record valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in order for to realize our deferred tax asset we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdiction where the deferred tax asset are located we consider future growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdiction in which we operate historical earnings taxable income in prior year if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategy in determining the need for valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset would be realized we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance an adjustment to our provision for income tax at such time we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimate and assumption that could differ from the actual result reflected in income tax return filed during the subsequent year adjustment based on filed return are generally recorded in the period when the tax return are filed and the global tax implication are known which can materially impact our effective tax rate the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audit by federal state and foreign tax authority which often result in proposed assessment our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue may require certain judgment description of our accounting policy associated with tax related contingency assumed part of business combination is provided under business combination above for those tax related contingency that are not part of business combination we account for these uncertain tax issue table of content index to financial statement pursuant to asc income tax which contains two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit including resolution of any related appeal or litigation process the second step is to measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax position no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matter we adjust reserve for our uncertain tax position due to changing fact and circumstance such the closing of tax audit judicial ruling and refinement of estimate or realization of earnings or deduction that differ from our estimate to the extent that the final outcome of these matter is different than the amount recorded such difference generally will impact our provision for income tax in the period in which such determination is made our provision for income tax include the impact of reserve provision and change to reserve that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalty legal and other contingency we are currently involved in various claim and legal proceeding quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and ass our potential financial exposure description of our accounting policy associated with contingency assumed part of business combination is provided under business combination above for legal and other contingency that are not part of business combination we accrue liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable because of uncertainty related to these matter accrual are based only on the best information available at the time the accrual are made additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claim and litigation and may revise our estimate such revision in the estimate of the potential liability could have material impact on our result of operation and financial position result of operation impact of the tax cut and job act of the comparability of our operating result

with approximately having maturity date within one year and having maturity date within one to four year description of our marketable security held is included in note and of note to consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report and liquidity and capital resource above we held mix of both fixed and floating rate debt security fixed rate security may have their market value adversely impacted interest rate increase while floating rate security may produce le income than expected if interest rate fall due in part to these factor our future investment income may vary due to change in interest rate or we may realize loss if we are forced to sell security that decline in market value due to change in interest rate however because we classify our debt security available for sale no gain or loss are recognized due to change in interest rate unless such security are sold prior to maturity or decline in fair value are determined to be other than temporary the fair value of our fixed rate debt security are impacted by interest rate movement and if interest rate would have been higher by basis point of each of may and we estimate the change

swap agreement of may and were million net loss and million net loss respectively we estimate that the change in the fair value of these swap agreement during fiscal and were primarily attributable to an increase in forward interest rate price if libor based interest rate would have been higher by basis point of may and the change would have decreased the collective fair value of the fixed to variable swap agreement by million and million respectively table of content index to financial statement by issuing the floating rate note and by entering into the aforementioned swap arrangement we have assumed risk associated with variable interest rate based upon libor change in the overall level of interest rate affect the interest expense that we recognize in our consolidated statement of

statement included elsewhere in this annual report currency risk foreign currency transaction risk foreign currency forward contract we transact business in various foreign currency and have established program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contract to offset the risk associated with the effect of certain foreign currency exposure under this program our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contract so that increase or decrease in our foreign currency exposure are offset by gain or loss on the foreign currency forward contract in order to mitigate the risk and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction we may suspend this program from time to time our foreign currency exposure typically arise from intercompany sublicense fee intercompany loan and other intercompany transaction our foreign currency forward contract are generally short term in duration we neither use these foreign currency forward contract for trading purpose nor do we designate these forward contract hedging instrument pursuant to asc accordingly we record the fair value of these contract of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with change in fair value recorded to our consolidated statement of operation given the short duration of the forward contract amount recorded generally are not significant the balance sheet classification for the fair value of these forward contract is prepaid expense and other current asset for forward contract in an unrealized gain position and other current liability for forward contract in an unrealized loss position the statement of operation classification for change in fair value of these forward contract is non operating income net for both realized and unrealized gain and loss we expect that we will continue to realize gain or loss with respect to our foreign currency exposure net of gain or loss from our foreign currency forward contract our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposure will generally depend on the size and type of cross currency transaction that we enter into the currency exchange rate associated with these exposure and change in those rate the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contract and other factor the notional amount of the forward contract we held to purchase dollar in exchange for other major international currency were billion and billion of may and respectively and the notional amount of forward contract we held to sell dollar in exchange for other major international

expect that our disclosure control and procedure or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objective of the control system are met further the design of control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraint and the

instance of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitation include the reality that judgment in decision making can be faulty and that breakdown can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally control can be circumvented by the individual act of some person by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of control also is based in part upon certain assumption about the likelihood of future event and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving it stated goal under all potential future condition

enable increased performance and higher availability of oracle product and service education service include instructor led medium based and internet based training in the use of our cloud software and hardware product topic is single standard for revenue recognition that applies to all of our cloud license hardware and service arrangement and generally requires revenue to be recognized upon the transfer of control of promised good or service provided to our customer reflecting the amount of consideration we expect to receive for those good or service pursuant to topic revenue are recognized upon the application of the following step identification of the contract or contract with customer identification of the performance obligation in the contract determination of the transaction price allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract and recognition of revenue when or the contractual performance obligation are satisfied the timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to our customer we record an unbilled receivable which is included within account receivable on our consolidated balance sheet when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing we record deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet when revenue are recognized subsequent to cash collection for an invoice our standard payment term are generally net day but may vary invoice for cloud license and on premise license and hardware product are generally issued when the license is made available for customer use or upon delivery to the customer of the hardware product invoice for license support and hardware support contract are generally invoiced annually in advance cloud saas and iaa contract are generally invoiced annually quarterly or monthly in advance service are generally invoiced in advance or the service are performed most contract that contain financing component are contract financed through our financing division the transaction price for contract that is financed through our financing division is adjusted to reflect the time value of money and interest revenue is recorded component of non operating income net within our consolidated statement of operation based on market rate in the country in which the transaction is being financed our revenue arrangement generally include standard warranty or service level provision that our arrangement will perform and operate in all material respect defined in the respective agreement the financial impact of which have historically been and are expected to continue to be insignificant our arrangement generally do not include general right of return relative to the delivered product or service we recognize revenue net of any tax collected from customer which are subsequently remitted to governmental authority revenue recognition for cloud service revenue from cloud service provided on subscription basis are generally recognized ratably over the contractual period that the service are delivered beginning on the date our service is made available to our customer we recognize revenue ratably because the customer receives and consumes the benefit of the cloud service throughout the contract period revenue from cloud service provided on consumption basis such metered service are generally recognized based on the utilization of the service by the customer revenue recognition for license support and hardware support oracle primary performance obligation with respect to license support contract and hardware support contract are to provide customer with technical support needed and unspecified software product upgrade maintenance release and patch during the term of the support period if and when they are available oracle is obligated to make the license and hardware support service available continuously throughout the contract table of content index to financial statement oracle corporation note to consolidated financial statement continued may period therefore revenue for license support contract and hardware support contract are generally recognized ratably over the contractual period that the support service are provided revenue recognition for cloud license and on premise license revenue from distinct cloud license and on premise license performance obligation are generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use revenue from usage based royalty arrangement for distinct cloud license and on premise license are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs for usage based royalty arrangement with fixed minimum guarantee amount the minimum amount is generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the royalty customer revenue recognition for hardware product the hardware product and related software such an operating system or firmware are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for combined performance obligation the revenue for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer revenue recognition for service service revenue are generally recognized over time the service are performed revenue for fixed price service are generally recognized over time applying input method to estimate progress to completion revenue for consumption based service are generally recognized the service are performed allocation of the transaction price for contract that have multiple performance obligation many of our contract include multiple performance obligation judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation is distinct oracle product and service generally do not require significant amount of integration or interdependency therefore our product and service are generally not combined we allocate the transaction price for each contract to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price ssp for each performance obligation within each contract we use judgment in determining the ssp for product and service for substantially all performance obligation except cloud license and on premise license we are able to establish the ssp based on the observable price of product or service sold separately in comparable circumstance to similar customer we typically establish an ssp range for our product and service which is reassessed on periodic basis or when fact and circumstance change our cloud license and on premise license have not historically been sold on standalone basis the vast majority of all customer elect to purchase license support contract at the time of cloud license and on premise license purchase license support contract are generally priced percentage of the net fee paid by the customer to access the license we are unable to establish the ssp for our cloud license and on premise license based on observable price given the same product are sold for broad range of amount that is the selling price is highly variable and representative ssp is not discernible from past transaction or other observable evidence result the ssp for cloud license and an on premise license included in contract with multiple performance obligation is determined by applying residual approach whereby all other performance obligation within contract are first allocated portion of the transaction price based upon their respective ssps with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and on premise license revenue table of content index to financial statement oracle corporation note to consolidated financial statement continued may remaining performance obligation from customer contract trade receivables net of allowance for doubtful account and deferred revenue are reported net of

and remaining performance obligation represent contracted revenue that had not yet been recognized and include deferred revenue invoice that have been issued to customer but were uncollected and have not been recognized revenue and amount that will be invoiced and recognized revenue in future period the volume and amount of customer contract that we book and total revenue that we recognize are impacted by variety of seasonal factor in each fiscal year the amount and volume of contracting activity and our total revenue are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter these seasonal impact influence how our remaining performance obligation change over time of may our remaining performance obligation were billion approximately of which we expect to recognize revenue over the next twelve month and the remainder thereafter refer to note for our discussion of revenue disaggregation sale of financing receivables we offer certain of our customer the option to acquire our software product hardware product and service offering through separate long term payment contract we generally sell these contract that we have financed for our customer on non recourse basis to financial institution within day of the contract date of execution we record the transfer of amount due from customer to financial institution sale of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables during fiscal and billion billion and billion respectively of our financing receivables were sold to financial institution business combination we apply the provision of asc business combination asc in accounting for our acquisition asc requires that we evaluate whether transaction pertains to an acquisition of asset or to an acquisition of business business is defined an integrated set of asset and activity that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing return to investor asset acquisition are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual asset and liability assumed on relative fair value basis whereas the acquisition of business requires to recognize separately from goodwill the asset acquired and the liability assumed at the acquisition date fair value goodwill of the acquisition date is measured the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair value of the asset acquired and the liability assumed while we use our best estimate and assumption to accurately value asset acquired and liability assumed at the acquisition date well any contingent consideration where applicable our estimate are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustment to the asset acquired and liability assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the value of asset acquired or liability assumed whichever come first any subsequent adjustment are recorded to our consolidated statement of operation cost to exit or restructure certain activity of an acquired company or our internal operation are accounted for termination and exit cost pursuant to asc exit or disposal cost obligation and are accounted for separately from the business combination liability for cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at it fair value in our consolidated statement of table of content index to financial statement oracle corporation note to consolidated financial statement continued may operation in the period in which the liability is incurred when estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activity assumption are applied regarding estimated sub lease payment to be received which can differ from actual result this may require to revise our initial estimate which may affect our result of operation and financial position in the period the revision is made for given acquisition we may identify certain pre acquisition contingency of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre acquisition contingency throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to ass whether we include these contingency part of the fair value estimate of asset acquired and liability assumed and if so to determine their estimated amount if we can not reasonably determine the fair value of non income tax related pre acquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period which is generally the case given the nature of such matter we will recognize an asset or liability for such pre acquisition contingency if it is probable that an asset existed or liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated subsequent to the measurement period change in our estimate of such contingency will affect earnings and could have material effect on our result of operation and financial position in addition uncertain tax position and tax related valuation allowance assumed in connection with business combination are initially estimated of the acquisition date we reevaluate these item quarterly based upon fact and circumstance that existed of the acquisition date with any adjustment to our preliminary estimate being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance or contingency estimated value whichever come first change to these uncertain tax position and tax related valuation allowance will affect our provision for income tax in our consolidated statement of operation and could have material impact on our result of operation and financial position marketable and non marketable security in accordance with asc investment debt and equity security and based on our intention regarding these instrument we classify substantially all of our marketable debt security available for sale marketable debt security classified available for sale are reported at fair value with all unrealized gain loss reflected net of tax in stockholder equity on our consolidated balance sheet and line item in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income if we determine that an investment ha an other than temporary decline in fair value we recognize the investment loss in non operating income net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operation we periodically evaluate our investment to determine if impairment charge are required substantially all of our marketable debt investment are classified current based on the nature of the investment and their availability for use in current operation investment in equity security other than equity method investment are recorded at fair value if fair value is readily determinable we hold investment in certain non marketable equity security with no readily determinable fair value in which we do not have controlling interest or significant influence upon adoption of asu effective june we have elected

allowance for doubtful account based upon specific review of all significant outstanding invoice for those invoice not specifically reviewed provision are provided at differing rate based upon the age of the receivable the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable wa recorded in and current economic trend we write off receivable and charge it against it recorded allowance when we have exhausted our collection effort without success concentration of risk financial instrument that are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalent marketable security derivative and trade receivables our cash and cash equivalent are generally held with large diverse financial institution worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure to any single financial institution investment policy have been implemented that limit purchase of marketable debt security to investment grade security our derivative contract are transacted with various financial institution with high credit standing and any exposure to counterparty credit related loss in these contract is largely mitigated with collateral security agreement that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of these contract fluctuate from contractually established threshold we generally do not require collateral to secure account receivable the risk with respect to trade receivables is mitigated by credit evaluation we perform on our customer the short duration of our payment term for the significant majority of our customer contract and by the diversification of our customer base no single customer accounted for or more of our total revenue in fiscal or we outsource the manufacturing assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware product to variety of company many of which are located outside the further we have simplified our supply chain process by reducing the number of third party manufacturing partner and the number of
