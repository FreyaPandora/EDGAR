other calculator royalty and other of ti revenue market characteristic competitive landscape despite recent consolidation the analog and embedded processing market remain highly fragmented result we face significant global competition from dozen of large and small company including broad based supplier and niche supplier our competitor also include emerging company particularly in asia that sell product into the market in which we operate we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factor including the breadth of company product line the strength and depth of it channel to market technological innovation product development execution technical support customer service quality reliability price and scale the primary competitive factor for our analog product include design proficiency diverse product portfolio to meet wide ranging customer need manufacturing process technology that provide differentiated level of performance application and sale support and manufacturing expertise and capacity the primary competitive factor for our embedded processing product are the ability to design and cost effectively manufacture product system level knowledge about targeted end market the installed base of software software expertise application and sale support and product performance integration and power characteristic product cycle the global semiconductor market is characterized by constant though generally incremental advance in product design and manufacturing process semiconductor price and manufacturing cost tend to decline over time manufacturing process and product life cycle mature market cycle the semiconductor cycle refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inventory the semiconductor market historically ha been characterized by period of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and or insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by period of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand and or excess manufacturing capacity these are typically referred to upturn and downturn in the semiconductor cycle the semiconductor cycle could be affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facility we employ several strategy to dampen the effect of the semiconductor cycle on ti we acquire our manufacturing facility and equipment ahead of demand which usually allows to acquire this capacity lower cost we focus our resource on our analog and embedded processing segment which serve diverse market and diverse customer this diversity reduces our dependence on the performance of single market or small group of customer additionally we utilize consignment inventory program with our customer and distributor that give improved insight into customer demand seasonality our revenue is subject to seasonal variation historically our sequential revenue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarter compared to the second and third quarter manufacturing semiconductor manufacturing begin with sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing step that fabricate number of semiconductor device on thin silicon wafer each device on the wafer is packaged and tested the entire process take place in highly specialized facility and requires an average of week with product completing within to week the cost and lifespan of the equipment and process we use to manufacture semiconductor vary by technology our analog product and most of our embedded processing product can be manufactured using mature and stable and therefore le expensive equipment than is needed for manufacturing advanced logic product such some of our processor product we own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facility in north america asia japan and europe these include both wafer fabrication and assembly test facility our facility require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed cost asset in operation we own much of our manufacturing capacity therefore significant portion of our operating cost is fixed and change in factory loading can cause short term variation in profit margin when factory loading decrease our fixed cost are spread over reduced output and absent other circumstance our profit margin decrease conversely factory loading increase our fixed cost are spread over increased output and absent other circumstance our profit margin increase our operating focus is more on maximizing long term free cash flow than minimizing short term variation in profit margin caused by factory loading to this end we seek to maximize long term free cash flow by keeping capital expenditure low through opportunistic purchase of facility and equipment ahead of demand we expect to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the vast majority of our production need to supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and return on capital we utilize the capacity of outside supplier commonly known foundry and subcontractor in we sourced about percent of our total wafer from external foundry and about percent of our assembly test service from subcontractor customer we estimate that we sell our product to about customer our customer base is diverse with more than one third of our revenue deriving from customer outside our largest sale and distribution we market and sell our semiconductor product through direct sale and distributor and online we have sale or marketing office in more than country and we continue to expand our online presence about percent of our sale are fulfilled through distribution channel our distributor maintain an inventory of our product and sell directly to wide range of customer also sell product from our competitor inventory our inventory practice differ by product we generally maintain inventory level that are consistent with our expectation of customer demand we carry proportionally more inventory of product with long life cycle and broad customer base additionally we sometimes maintain product inventory in unfinished wafer form well higher finished good inventory of low volume product allowing greater flexibility in period of high demand about percent of ti revenue is fulfilled from consignment inventory program that we have in place for our large customer and distributor with these program we own inventory that is stored at our customer and distributor location and we recognize revenue when the product is pulled from consigned inventory these consignment program give improved insight into demand allowing to better manage our factory loading about percent of our distributor revenue is generated from sale of consigned inventory backlog we define backlog of particular date purchase order with customer requested delivery date within specified length of time our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period customer requirement and industry condition change order may be subject to cancellation or modification of term such pricing quantity or delivery date customer order placement practice continually evolve based on customer individual business need and capability well industry supply and capacity consideration our consignment program do not result in backlog because the order occurs at the same time delivery when the customer pull the product from consigned inventory our backlog of order wa billion at december and billion at december acquisition divestiture and investment from time to time we consider acquisition and divestiture that may strengthen our strategic position we also make investment directly or indirectly in private company investment are focused primarily on next generation technology and market strategic to raw material we purchase material part and supply from number of supplier in some case we purchase such item from sole source supplier the material part and supply essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such material part and supply will be available in the foreseeable future intellectual property we own many patent and have many patent application pending in the united state and other country in field relating to our business we have developed strong broad based patent portfolio and continually add patent to that portfolio we also have license agreement which vary in duration involving right to our portfolio or of other company we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license we often participate in industry initiative to set technical standard our competitor may participate in the same initiative participation in these initiative may require to license certain of our patent to other company on reasonable and non discriminatory term we own trademark that are used in the conduct of our business these trademark are valuable asset the most important of which are texas instrument and our corporate monogram research and development our expense wa billion in compared with billion in and billion in our primary area of investment are analog and embedded processing product we conduct most of our internally however we also closely engage with wide range of third party including software supplier university and select industry

instrument incorporated box dallas texas attention investor relation item risk factor read the following risk factor in conjunction with the factor discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filing with the security and exchange commission sec and in material incorporated by reference into these filing these risk factor are intended to highlight certain factor that may affect our financial condition and result of operation and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risk that apply to ti company with broad international operation like other company we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturn in the united state or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customer similarly the price of our security is subject to volatility due to fluctuation in general market condition actual financial result that do not meet our and or the investment community expectation change in our and or the investment community expectation for our future result and other factor many of which are beyond our control we face substantial competition that requires to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressure we face intense technological and pricing competition in the market in which we operate we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitor and from small competitor serving niche market and also from emerging company particularly in asia that sell product into the same market in which we operate for example we may face increased competition result of china actively promoting and reshaping it domestic semiconductor industry through policy change and investment these action may restrict from participating in the china market or may prevent from competing effectively with chinese company certain of our competitor posse sufficient financial technical and management resource to develop and market product that may compete favorably our product and consolidation among our competitor may allow them to compete more effectively additionally traditional intellectual property licensors are increasingly providing functionality design and complete hardware or software solution that compete with our product the price and product development pressure that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margin and lost business opportunity in the event that we are unable to match the price decline or cost efficiency or meet the technological product support software or manufacturing advancement of our competitor rapid technological change in market we serve requires to develop new technology and product rapid technological change in market we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycle and decline in average selling price of our product our result of operation depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative product we make significant investment in research and development to develop new technology and product to meet changing customer demand and we might not realize return on our investment because they are generally made commercial viability can be assured further project that are commercially viable may not contribute significant revenue until at least year after they are completed change in expected demand for our product could have material adverse effect on our result of operation our customer include company in wide range of end market and sector within those market if demand in one or more sector within our end market decline or grows at significantly slower pace than management expects our result of operation may be adversely affected the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market may lead to significant and often rapid increase and decrease in product demand additionally the loss or significant curtailment of purchase by one or more of our large customer including curtailment due to change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policy or practice of these customer or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustment may adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition our result of operation also might suffer because of general decline in customer demand resulting from for example uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial market natural event or domestic or international political social economic or other condition breach of customer information technology system that disrupt customer operation or customer inability to access credit market and other source of needed liquidity our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill order may affect our ability to meet quarter revenue forecast in addition when responding to customer request for shorter shipment lead time we manufacture product based on forecast of customer demand these forecast are based on multiple assumption if we inaccurately forecast customer demand we may hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margin and adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition our global operation subject to risk associated with domestic or international political social economic or other condition we have facility in more than country about percent of our revenue come from shipment to location outside the united state in particular shipment of product into china typically represent large portion of our revenue we are exposed to political social and economic condition security risk terrorism or other hostile act health condition labor condition and possible disruption in transportation communication and information technology network of the various country in which we operate including the united state additionally certain country we operate have experienced and other country may experience increasing protectionism that may impact global trade this could result in an adverse effect on our operation and our financial result in addition our global operation expose to period when the dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non currency in which we transact business the remeasurement of non dollar transaction can have an adverse effect on our result of operation and financial condition our result of operation could be affected by natural event in the location in which we operate we have manufacturing data and design facility and other operation in location subject to natural occurrence such severe weather geological event or health epidemic that could disrupt operation natural disaster that result in prolonged disruption to our operation may adversely affect our result and financial condition our operating result and our reputation could be adversely affected by breach or disruption of our information technology system breach or disruption of our information technology system could be caused by computer virus system failure unauthorized access sabotage vandalism or terrorism these event could compromise our information technology network result in lost data or the unauthorized release of our our customer or our supplier confidential or proprietary information cause disruption to our manufacturing and other operation result in the release of employee personal data or cause to incur increased information technology protection cost any of which could adversely affect our operating result and our reputation we face supply chain and manufacturing risk we rely on third party to supply with good and service in cost effective and timely manner our access to needed good and service may be adversely affected by potential dispute with supplier or disruption in our supplier operation result of for example quality excursion uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial market domestic or international political social economic and other condition natural event in the location in which our supplier operate or limited or delayed access to key raw material natural resource and utility additionally breach of our supplier information technology system could result in release of our confidential or proprietary information if our supplier are unable to access credit market and other source of needed liquidity we may be unable to obtain needed supply collect account receivable or access needed technology in particular our manufacturing process and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw material natural resource and utility be available limited or delayed access to and high cost of these item could adversely affect our result of operation our product contain material that are subject to conflict mineral reporting requirement our relationship with customer and supplier may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our product conflict free additionally our cost may increase if one or more of our customer demand that we change the sourcing of material we can not identify conflict free our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technology or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our result of operation we subcontract portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our product and we depend on third party to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development we do not have long term contract with all of these supplier and the number of alternate supplier is limited reliance on these supplier involves risk including possible shortage of capacity in period of high demand supplier inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in timely cost effective and appropriate manner and the possibility of supplier imposition of increased cost on our operation could be affected by the complex law rule and regulation to which our business is subject we are subject to complex law rule and regulation affecting our domestic and international operation relating to for example the environment safety and health export and import bribery and corruption tax data privacy and protection labor and employment competition and intellectual property ownership and infringement compliance with these law rule and regulation may be onerous and expensive and could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our product and operate our business if we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity we could be subject to fine penalty or other legal liability furthermore should these law rule and regulation be amended or expanded or new one enacted we could incur materially greater compliance cost or restriction on our ability to manufacture our product and operate our business some of these complex law rule and regulation for example those related to environmental safety and health requirement may particularly affect in the jurisdiction in which we manufacture product especially if such law and regulation require the use of abatement equipment beyond we currently employ require the addition or elimination of raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing process or impose cost fee or reporting requirement on the direct or indirect use of energy natural resource or material or gas used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our product substitute for prohibited raw material or process might not be available or might not be available at reasonable cost our result of operation and our reputation could be affected by warranty claim product liability claim product recall or legal proceeding we could be subject to claim based on warranty product liability epidemic or delivery failure or other ground relating to our product manufacturing service design or communication that could lead to significant expense we defend such claim or pay damage award or settlement in the event of claim we may also incur cost if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer we maintain product liability insurance but is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claim in addition it is possible for one of our customer to recall product containing ti part for example with respect to product used in automotive application or handheld electronics which may cause to incur cost and expense relating to the recall any of these event could adversely affect our result of operation financial condition and our reputation our result of operation could be affected by change in tax related matter we have facility in more than country and result are subject to taxation and audit by number of taxing authority tax rate vary among the jurisdiction in which we operate if our tax rate increase our result of operation could be adversely affected number of factor could cause our tax to increase including change in the jurisdiction in which our profit are earned and taxed change in the mix of profit from those jurisdiction change in available tax credit change in applicable tax rate change in tariff regulation or surcharge or adverse resolution of audit by taxing authority in addition we are subject to law and regulation in various jurisdiction that determine how much profit ha been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction change in these law and regulation could affect the location where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our result of operation we have deferred tax asset on our balance sheet change in applicable tax law and regulation or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax asset which could also affect our result of operation each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast change our forecasted tax liability will change we have not made provision for income tax on the portion of our undistributed earnings of our non subsidiary that is considered permanently reinvested outside the united state if in the future we repatriate any of these foreign earnings we might incur incremental income tax which could affect our result of operation our result of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected if customer or distributor suffers loss with respect to our inventory we have consignment inventory program in place for some of our largest customer and distributor if customer or distributor to experience loss with respect to ti consigned inventory our result of operation and financial condition may be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer distributor or insurer or if our recovery is delayed our result of operation could be adversely affected by our distributor promotion of competing product line or our distributor financial performance in about percent of our revenue wa generated from sale of our product through distributor our distributor carry competing product line and our sale could be affected if our distributor promote competing product over our product moreover our result of operation could be affected if our distributor suffer financial difficulty that result in their inability to pay amount owed to dispute with or the loss of significant number of distributor could be disruptive or harmful to our current business our margin may vary over time our profit margin may be adversely affected by number of factor including decrease in customer demand and shipment volume obsolescence of our inventory shift in our product mix and change in tariff in addition we operate in highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our product because we own much of our manufacturing capacity significant portion of our operating cost is fixed in general these fixed cost do not decline with reduction in customer demand or factory loading and can adversely affect profit margin result our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property right and to maintain freedom of operation access to worldwide market depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio there can be no assurance that our business expands into new area we will be able to independently develop the technology software or know how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do without infringing the intellectual property right of others to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain license at all or on term we consider reasonable we may directly or indirectly face infringement claim from third party including non practicing entity that have acquired patent to pursue enforcement action against other company these assertion whether or not of any merit could expose to claim for damage and or injunction from third party well claim for indemnification by our customer in instance where we have contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damage resulting from infringement claim we actively enforce and protect our own intellectual property right however our effort can not prevent all misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology including for example third party use of our patented technology in their product without the right to do so or third party sale of counterfeit product bearing our trademark moreover the law of country where we operate may not protect our intellectual property right to the same extent law our debt could affect our operation and financial condition from time to time we issue debt security with various interest rate and maturity we believe we will have the ability to service this debt our ability to make principal and interest payment when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic condition industry cycle and business and other factor affecting our operation including the other risk factor described item many of which are beyond our control in addition our obligation to make principal and interest payment could divert fund that otherwise would be invested in our operation or returned to shareholder or could cause to raise fund by for example issuing new debt or equity or selling asset our result of operation and liquidity could be affected by change in the financial market we maintain bank account one or more multi year revolving credit agreement and portfolio of investment to support the financing need of the company our ability to fund our operation invest in our business make strategic acquisition service our debt obligation and meet our cash return objective depends upon continuous access to our bank and investment account and may depend on access to our bank credit line that support commercial paper borrowing and provide additional liquidity through short term bank loan if we are unable to access these account and credit line for example due to instability in the financial market our result of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to access the capital market or redeem our investment could be restricted increase in health care and pension benefit cost could affect our result of operation and financial condition federal and state health care reform program could increase our cost with regard to medical coverage of our employee which could reduce profitability and affect our result of operation and financial condition in addition obligation related to our pension and other postretirement plan reflect assumption that affect the planned funding and cost of these plan including the actual return on plan asset discount rate plan participant population demographic and change in pension regulation change in these assumption may affect plan funding cash flow and result of operation and our cost and funding obligation could increase significantly if our plan actual experience differs from these assumption our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit sufficient number of qualified employee in competitive environment our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel including engineering management marketing technical and staff personnel skilled and experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand and competition for their talent is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key engineering management and technical personnel that we require to execute our business strategy our ability to recruit internationally or deploy employee to various location may be limited by immigration law our ability to successfully implement business and organizational change could affect our business plan and result of operation from time to time we undertake business and organizational change including acquisition divestiture and restructuring action to support or carry our strategic objective our failure to successfully implement these change could adversely affect our business plan and operating result for example we may not realize the expected benefit of an acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate acquired operation product line and technology and our pre acquisition due diligence may not identify all possible issue and risk that might arise with respect to an acquisition further we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost saving benefit of business and organizational change and restructuring charge could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectation material impairment of our goodwill or intangible asset could adversely affect our result of operation we have significant amount of goodwill and intangible asset on our consolidated balance sheet charge associated with impairment of goodwill or intangible asset could adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation item unresolved staff comment not applicable item property our principal executive office are

data number of employee stockholder of record see note to the financial statement and management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation overview we design make and sell semiconductor to electronics designer and manufacturer all over the world our business model is carefully constructed around the following attribute industry broadest portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductor our customer need multiple chip for their system the breadth of our portfolio mean we can solve more of these need than can our competitor which give access to more customer and the opportunity to generate more revenue per system we invest more than billion each year to develop new product for our portfolio strong foundation of manufacturing technology and low cost production we invest in manufacturing technology that differentiate the feature of our semiconductor and we do most of our own production in house opposed to outsourcing it this ability to directly control our manufacturing help ensure consistent supply of product for our customer we produce billion of semiconductor each year on mixture of and millimeter wafer and we are able to keep cost low for manufacturing facility and equipment because our analog and much of our embedded processing semiconductor can be made using mature asset that we acquire ahead of demand when their price are most attractive in we increased factory loading by about percent for our analog semiconductor on millimeter wafer which have percent cost advantage per unpackaged chip over millimeter wafer the majority of our analog growth will be produced on millimeter wafer which will be meaningful to the growth of our cash flow over the long term industry largest market channel our global sale force is larger than those of our competitor the breadth of our portfolio attracts an increasing number of visit to our website where customer often begin their initial product search and design in journey our web presence together with our global sale force provides unique access to about customer diversity and longevity in our product and in the market we serve together the attribute result in diverse and long lived position that deliver high terminal value to our shareholder because of the breadth of our portfolio we are not dependent on any single product and because of the breadth of our market we are not dependent on any single application or customer some of our product generate revenue for decade which strengthens the return on our investment the combined effect of these attribute is that over time we have grown free cash flow and gained market share in analog and embedded processing these attribute put in unique class of company with the ability to grow generate cash and return that cash to shareholder management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation md should be read in conjunction with the financial statement and the related note that appear elsewhere in this document in the following discussion of our result of operation all dollar amount in the table are stated in million of dollar when we discus our result unless otherwise noted change in our revenue are attributable to change in customer demand which are evidenced by fluctuation in shipment volume new product tend not to have significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such large number of product from time to time our revenue and gross profit are affected by change in demand for higher priced or lower priced product which we refer to change in the mix of product shipped because we own much of our manufacturing capacity significant portion of our operating cost is fixed when factory loading decrease our fixed cost are spread over reduced output and absent other circumstance our profit margin decrease conversely factory loading increase our fixed cost are spread over increased output and absent other circumstance our profit margin increase increase and decrease in factory loading tend to correspond to increase and decrease in demand over time we have been allocating resource from area like manufacturing support and sg into activity result expense will continue increasing in our effective tax rate provision for income tax percentage of income before income tax benefit from lower tax rate compared to the statutory income tax rate applicable to our operation in many of the jurisdiction in which we operate and from tax benefit these lower non tax rate are generally statutory in nature without expiration and available to company that operate in those taxing jurisdiction our segment represent group of similar product that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirement product characteristic manufacturing process and distribution channel and how management allocates resource and measure result see note to the financial statement for more information regarding our segment in the fourth quarter of we adopted asu related to stock compensation we applied the new standard prospectively of the beginning of for the consolidated statement of income and on full retrospective basis for all period in the consolidated statement of cash flow see note to the financial statement for more detail result of operation we continued to perform well in reflecting our focus on analog and embedded processing these product serve highly diverse market with thousand of application and we believe have dependable long term growth opportunity in analog and embedded processing represented percent of revenue gross margin of percent for the year reflects the quality of our product portfolio well the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy our focus on analog and embedded processing allows to generate strong cash flow from operation in cash flow from operation were billion up from billion in free cash flow in wa percent of revenue up from percent year ago and consistent with our targeted range of percent of revenue during the year we returned billion of cash to investor through combination of stock repurchase and dividend our dividend represented percent of free cash flow underscoring their sustainability free cash flow is non gaap financial measure for reconciliation to gaap and an explanation of the reason for providing this non gaap measure see the non gaap financial information section after the liquidity and capital resource section detail of

increase in the dividend rate partially offset by fewer share outstanding during the quarterly dividend increased to from per share resulting in an annualized dividend payment of per share during we increased our quarterly dividend to from per share in we used billion to repurchase million share of our common stock this compared with billion used in to repurchase million share employee exercise of stock option are also reflected in cash flow from financing activity in these exercise provided cash proceeds of million compared with million in we had billion of cash and cash equivalent and billion of short term investment of december with our entity owning about percent of these amount combined at the end of we believe we have the necessary financial resource and operating plan to fund our working capital need capital expenditure dividend and debt related payment and other business requirement for at least the next month non gaap financial information this md includes reference to free cash flow and ratio based on that measure these are financial measure that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle in the united state gaap free cash flow wa calculated by subtracting capital expenditure from the most directly comparable gaap measure cash flow from operating activity also referred to cash flow from operation we believe that free cash flow and the associated ratio provide insight into our liquidity our cash generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholder well insight into our financial performance these non gaap measure are supplemental to the comparable gaap measure reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap based measure is provided in the table below for year ended

contractual obligation payment due by period contractual obligation thereafter total long term debt purchase commitment operating lease deferred compensation plan total includes the related interest payment and amount classified the current portion of long term debt specifically obligation that will mature within month includes payment for software license and contractual arrangement with supplier where there is fixed non cancellable payment schedule or minimum payment due with reduced delivery schedule excluded from the table are cancellable arrangement however depending on when certain purchase arrangement may be cancelled an additional million of cancellation penalty may be required to be paid which are not reflected in the table includes minimum payment for leased facility and equipment and purchase of industrial gas under contract accounted for operating lease includes an estimate of payment for certain liability that existed at december excluded from the table are million of uncertain tax liability under asc well any planned future funding contribution to retirement benefit plan amount associated with uncertain tax liability have been excluded because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority regarding future funding of retirement benefit plan we plan to contribute about million in but funding projection beyond are not practical to estimate due to the rule affecting tax deductible contribution and the impact from the plan asset performance interest rate and potential and non legislation critical accounting policy in preparing our consolidated financial statement in conformity with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state we use statistical analysis estimate and projection that affect the reported amount and related disclosure and may vary from actual result we consider the following accounting policy to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require the most subjective judgment if actual result differ significantly from management estimate and projection there could be significant effect on our financial statement revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sale of our product including sale to our distributor when title and risk of loss pas which usually occurs upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor depending upon the term of the sale order when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists when sale amount are fixed or determinable and when collectability is reasonably assured for sale to distributor payment is due on our standard commercial term and is not contingent upon resale of the product revenue from sale of our product that are subject to inventory consignment agreement including consignment arrangement with distributor is recognized in accordance with the principle discussed above delivery occurs when the customer or distributor pull product from consignment inventory that we store at designated location we recognize revenue net of allowance which are management estimate of future credit to be granted to customer or distributor under program common in the semiconductor industry these allowance which are not material generally include volume based incentive product return due to quality issue incentive designed to maximize growth opportunity and special pricing arrangement allowance are based on analysis of historical data current economic condition and contractual term and are recorded when revenue is recognized we believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowance for credit to distributor in timely manner in addition we record allowance for account receivable that we estimate may not be collected we monitor collectability of account receivable primarily through review of the account receivable aging when collection is at risk we ass the impact on amount recorded for bad debt and if necessary will record charge in the period such determination is made we recognize in revenue shipping fee if any received from customer we include shipping and handling cost in cost of revenue the majority of our customer pay these fee directly to third party income tax in determining net income for financial statement purpose we must make certain estimate and judgment in the calculation of tax provision and the resultant tax liability and in the recoverability of deferred tax asset that arise from temporary difference the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in the ordinary course of global business there may be many transaction and calculation where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the calculation of tax liability involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax law we recognize potential liability for anticipated tax audit issue in the and other tax jurisdiction based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether and the extent to which additional tax will be due although we believe the estimate are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matter will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provision and accrual part of our financial process we must ass the likelihood that our deferred tax asset can be recovered if recovery is not likely the provision for tax must be increased by recording reserve in the form of valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable in this process certain relevant criterion are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liability that can be used to absorb deferred tax asset the taxable income in prior year that can be used to absorb net operating loss and credit carrybacks and taxable income in future year our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax asset based on these criterion may change due to various factor including change in or international tax law and change in market condition and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future period these change if any may require material adjustment to the deferred tax asset and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determination are made also our plan for the permanent reinvestment or eventual repatriation of the accumulated earnings of certain of our non operation could change such change could have material effect on tax expense in future year in addition to the factor described above the estimated annual tax rate which excludes discrete item reflected in forward looking statement is based on current tax law significant change in tax law enacted during the year could affect these estimate retroactive change in tax law enacted subsequent to the end of reporting period are reflected in the period of enactment inventory valuation allowance inventory is valued net of allowance for unsalable or obsolete raw material work in process and finished good statistical allowance are determined quarterly for raw material and work in process based on historical disposal of inventory for salability and obsolescence reason for finished good quarterly statistical allowance are determined by comparing inventory level of individual part to historical shipment current backlog and estimated future sale in order to identify inventory judged unlikely to be sold specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is significant event not captured by the statistical allowance example are an end of life part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation allowance are also calculated quarterly for instance where inventoried cost for individual product are in excess of market price for those product actual future write offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reason may differ from estimate and calculation used to determine valuation allowance due to change in customer demand customer negotiation technology shift and other factor change in accounting standard see note to the financial statement for information on new accounting standard off balance sheet arrangement of december we had no significant off balance sheet arrangement defined in item ii of sec regulation commitment and contingency see note to the financial statement for discussion of our commitment and contingency item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign exchange risk the dollar is the functional currency for financial reporting our non entity own asset or liability denominated in dollar or other currency exchange rate fluctuation can have significant impact on taxable income in those jurisdiction and consequently on our effective tax rate our balance sheet also reflects amount remeasured from non dollar currency because most of the aggregate non dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contract based on year end balance and currency exchange rate hypothetical percent plus or minus fluctuation in non currency exchange rate relative to the dollar would result in pre tax currency exchange gain or loss of about million we use these forward currency exchange contract to reduce the earnings impact exchange rate fluctuation may have on our non dollar net balance sheet exposure for example at year end we had forward currency exchange contract outstanding with notional value of million to hedge net balance sheet exposure including million to sell japanese yen and million to sell euro similar hedging activity existed at year end interest rate risk we have the following potential exposure to change in interest rate the effect of change in interest rate on the fair value of our investment in cash equivalent and short term investment which could produce gain or loss and the effect of change in interest rate on the fair value of our debt of december hypothetical basis point increase in interest rate would decrease the fair value of our investment in cash equivalent and short term investment by million and decrease the fair value of our long term debt by million because interest rate on our long term debt are fixed change in interest rate would not affect the cash flow associated with long term debt equity risk long term investment at year end include the following investment in mutual fund includes mutual fund that were selected to generate return that offset change in certain liability related to deferred compensation arrangement the mutual fund hold variety of debt and equity investment investment in venture capital fund includes investment in limited partnership accounted for under either the equity or cost method equity investment includes non marketable non publicly traded equity security investment in mutual fund are stated at fair value change in price of the mutual fund investment are expected to offset related change in deferred compensation liability such that percent increase or

such percentage of operating expense or headcount our centralized manufacturing and support organization such facility procurement and logistics provide support to our operating segment including those in other cost incurred by these organization including depreciation are charged to the segment on per unit basis consequently depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segment result and therefore is not provided the asset and liability associated with these organization are included in other with the exception of goodwill we do not identify or allocate

basis of presentation and significant accounting policy and practice basis of presentation the consolidated financial statement have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state gaap the basis of these financial statement is comparable for all period presented herein except for the adoption of new accounting standard in the fourth quarter of related to stock compensation which includes certain provision applied prospectively see change in accounting standard for further information the consolidated financial statement include the account

in million of dollar unless otherwise indicated we have reclassified certain amount in the prior period financial statement to conform to the presentation retrospectively applying certain provision of the new accounting standard related to stock compensation the preparation of financial statement requires the use of estimate from which final result may vary significant accounting policy and practice revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sale of our product including sale to our distributor when title and risk of loss pas which usually occurs upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor depending upon the term of the sale order when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists when sale amount are fixed or determinable and when collectability is reasonably

fee directly to third party advertising cost we expense advertising and other promotional cost incurred this expense wa million in million in and million in income tax we account for income tax using an asset and liability approach we record the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax asset and liability for future tax consequence of event that have been recognized in the financial statement or tax return we record valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized other assessed tax some transaction require to collect tax such sale value added and excise tax from our customer these transaction are presented in our consolidated statement of income on net excluded from revenue basis earnings per share eps unvested share based payment award that contain non forfeitable right to receive dividend or dividend equivalent such our restricted stock unit rsus are considered to be participating security and the two class method is used for purpose of calculating eps under the two class method portion of net income is allocated to these participating security and therefore is

of diluted earnings per common share during potentially dilutive security representing million and million share of common stock that were outstanding in and respectively were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share for these period because their effect would have been anti dilutive investment we present investment on our consolidated balance sheet cash equivalent short term investment or long term investment specific detail are follows cash equivalent and short term investment we consider investment in debt security with maturity of day or le from the date of our investment to be cash equivalent we consider investment in debt security with maturity beyond day from the date of our investment available for use in current operation and include them in short term investment the primary objective of our cash equivalent and short term investment activity are to preserve capital and maintain liquidity while generating appropriate return long term investment long term investment consist of mutual fund venture capital fund and non marketable equity security classification of investment depending on our reason for holding the investment and our ownership percentage we classify our investment either available for sale trading equity method or cost method which are more fully described in note we determine cost or amortized cost appropriate on specific identification basis inventory inventory are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value cost is generally computed on currently adjusted standard cost basis which approximates cost on first in first out basis standard cost is based on the normal utilization of installed factory capacity cost associated with underutilization of capacity is expensed incurred inventory held at consignment location is included in our finished good inventory consigned inventory wa million and million of december and respectively we review inventory quarterly for salability and obsolescence statistical allowance is provided for inventory considered unlikely to be sold the statistical allowance is based on an analysis of historical disposal activity historical customer shipment well estimated future sale specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is significant event not captured by the statistical allowance we write off inventory in the period in which disposal occurs property plant and equipment acquisition related intangible and other capitalized cost property plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful life using the straight line method our cost basis includes certain asset acquired in business combination that were initially recorded at fair value of the date of acquisition leasehold improvement are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement we amortize acquisition related intangible on straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the asset capitalized software license generally are amortized on straight line basis over the term of the license fully depreciated or amortized asset are written off against accumulated depreciation or amortization impairment of long lived asset we regularly review whether fact or circumstance exist that indicate the carrying value of property plant and equipment or other long lived asset including intangible asset are impaired we ass the recoverability of asset by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flow associated with those asset to their respective carrying amount any impairment charge is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those asset fair value is determined by available market valuation if applicable or by discounted cash flow goodwill and indefinite lived intangible goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicator arise we perform our annual goodwill impairment test of october for our reporting unit which compare the fair value for each reporting unit to it associated carrying value including goodwill see note for additional information foreign currency the functional currency for our non subsidiary is the dollar account recorded in currency other than the dollar are remeasured into the functional currency current asset except inventory deferred income tax other asset current liability and long term liability are remeasured at exchange rate in effect at the end of each reporting period property plant and equipment with associated depreciation and inventory are valued at historical exchange rate revenue and expense account other than depreciation for each month are remeasured at the appropriate

adjusted for consistency in presentation our adoption of this standard only affect our presentation of fair value of postretirement plan asset in note and doe not impact our financial position and result of operation in march the fasb issued asu no compensation stock compensation topic improvement to employee share based payment accounting this standard provides for several change to the

adjustment of january the beginning of the annual period that includes the adoption each of the provision within this standard ha it own specified transition method some have been applied prospectively and others have been applied on retrospective basis the primary effect of early adoption on our financial statement are follows income statement effect prospective basis net excess tax

activity in our consolidated statement of cash flow this change is required to be applied retrospectively and thus prior period have been adjusted under this standard entity are permitted to make an accounting policy election to either estimate forfeiture on stock compensation award previously required or to recognize forfeiture they occur we elected not to change our policy on accounting for

activity cash flow from financing activity standard not yet adopted in may the fasb issued asu no revenue from contract with customer topic this standard provides single set of guideline for revenue recognition to be used across all industry and requires additional disclosure it is effective for annual and interim reporting period beginning after december this standard permit early adoption but not before december and permit the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on our financial position and result of operation well our selected transition method based on our preliminary assessment we believe the new standard will not have material impact on our financial position and result of operation we do not expect to change the manner or timing of recognizing revenue on majority of our revenue transaction we recognize revenue on sale to customer and distributor upon satisfaction of our performance obligation when the good are shipped for consignment sale we recognize revenue when the good are pulled from consignment inventory in january the fasb issued asu no financial instrument overall subtopic recognition and measurement of financial asset and financial liability under this standard all equity investment except those accounted for under the equity method are required to be measured at fair value equity investment that do not have readily determinable fair value may practical expedient be measured at cost adjusted for change in observable price minus impairment this standard is effective for our interim and annual period beginning january we do not expect this standard to have material impact on our financial position and result of operation nearly all of our equity investment are already recorded at fair value or under the equity method in february the fasb issued asu no lease topic this standard requires all lease that have term of over month to be recognized on the balance sheet with the liability for lease payment and the corresponding right of use asset initially measured at the present value of amount expected to be paid over the term recognition of the cost of these lease on the income statement will be dependent upon their classification either an operating or financing lease cost of an operating lease will continue to be recognized single operating expense on straight line basis over the lease term cost for financing lease will be disaggregated and recognized both an operating expense for the amortization of the right of use asset and interest expense for interest on the lease liability this standard will be effective for our interim and annual period beginning january and must be applied on modified retrospective basis to lease existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statement early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the timing of adoption and the potential impact of this standard on our financial position but we do not expect it to have material impact on our result of operation in june the fasb issued asu no financial instrument credit loss topic measurement of credit loss on financial instrument this standard requires entity to use current lifetime expected credit loss methodology to measure impairment of certain financial asset using this methodology will result in earlier recognition of loss than under the current incurred loss approach which requires waiting to recognize loss until it is probable of having been incurred there are other provision within the standard that affect how impairment of other financial asset may be recorded and presented and that expand disclosure this standard will be effective for our interim and annual period beginning after december and permit earlier application but not before december the standard will be applied using modified retrospective approach we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard but we do not expect it to have material impact on our financial position and result of operation restructuring charge other restructuring

mitigate risk of concentration within market sector our investment policy is designed to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the plan asset and liability the appropriate mix of equity and bond investment is determined primarily through the use of detailed asset liability modeling study that look to balance the impact of change in the discount rate against the need to provide asset growth to cover future service cost most of our plan around the world have greater proportion of fixed income security with return characteristic that are more closely aligned with change in the liability caused by discount rate volatility for the plan we utilize an option collar strategy to reduce the volatility of return on investment in equity fund the only level asset in our worldwide benefit plan for the period presented is diversified property fund in non pension plan these investment are valued using input from the fund manager and internal model change to the fair value of this

determine benefit obligation discount rate long term pay progression weighted average assumption used to determine net periodic benefit cost discount rate long term rate of return on plan asset long term pay progression we utilize variety of method to select an appropriate discount rate depending on the depth of the corporate bond market in the country in which the benefit plan operates in the united state we use settlement approach whereby portfolio of bond is selected from the universe of actively traded high quality corporate bond the selected portfolio is designed to provide cash flow sufficient to pay the plan expected benefit payment when due the resulting discount rate reflects the rate of return of the selected portfolio of bond for our non location with sufficient number of actively traded high quality bond an analysis is performed in which the projected cash flow from the defined benefit plan are discounted against yield curve constructed with an appropriate universe of high quality corporate bond available in each country in this manner present value is developed the discount rate selected is the single equivalent rate that produce the same present value for country that lack sufficient corporate bond market government bond index adjusted for an appropriate risk premium is used to establish the discount rate assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan asset are based on future expectation for return for each asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing we adjust the result for the payment of reasonable expense of the plan from plan asset we believe our assumption are appropriate based on the investment mix and long term nature of the plan investment assumption used for the non defined benefit plan reflect the different economic environment within the various country the target allocation range for the plan that hold substantial majority of the defined benefit asset are follows defined retiree non asset
