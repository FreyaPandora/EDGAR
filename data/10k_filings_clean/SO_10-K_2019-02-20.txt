applicable state regulatory agency in future rate proceeding may alter the timing or amount of certain cost for which recovery is allowed or modify the current authorized rate of return rate refund may also be required additionally the rate charged to wholesale customer by the traditional electric operating company and by southern power and the rate charged to natural gas transportation customer by southern company gas pipeline investment and for some of it storage asset must be approved by the ferc these wholesale rate could be affected by change to southern power and the traditional electric operating company ability to conduct business pursuant to ferc market based rate authority retaining this authority from the ferc is important to the traditional electric operating company and southern power ability to remain competitive in the wholesale electric market the impact of any future revision or change in interpretation of existing regulation or the adoption of new law and regulation applicable to southern company or any of it subsidiary is uncertain change in regulation or the imposition of additional regulation could influence the operating environment of southern company and it subsidiary and may result in substantial cost or otherwise negatively affect their result of operation the southern company system cost of compliance with environmental law and satisfying related aros are significant the cost of compliance with current and future environmental law and related aros and the incurrence of environmental liability could negatively impact the net income cash flow and financial condition of the registrant the southern company system operation are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental agency through variety of law and regulation compliance with existing environmental requirement involves significant capital and operating cost including the settlement of aros major portion of which is expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provision or through market based contract there is no assurance however that all such cost will be recovered the registrant expect future compliance expenditure will continue to be significant the epa ha adopted and is implementing regulation governing air and water quality under the clean air act and regulation governing cooling water intake structure and effluent guideline for steam electric generating plant under the clean water act the epa ha also adopted regulation governing the disposal of ccr including coal ash and gypsum in landfill and surface impoundment at active generating power plant the cost estimate for aros related to the disposal of ccr are based on information using various assumption related to closure and post closure cost timing of future cash outlay inflation and discount rate and the potential method for complying with the ccr rule the traditional electric operating company will continue to periodically update their aro cost estimate additionally environmental law and regulation covering the handling and disposal of waste and release of hazardous substance could require the southern company system to incur substantial cost to clean up affected site including certain current and former operating site and location affected by historical operation or subject to contractual obligation existing environmental law and regulation may be revised or new environmental law and regulation may be adopted or become applicable to the southern company system in addition existing environmental law and regulation may be impacted by related legal challenge litigation over environmental issue and claim of various type including property damage personal injury common law nuisance and citizen enforcement of

estimated such expenditure could affect result of operation cash flow and or financial condition if such cost are not recovered on timely basis through regulated rate for the traditional electric operating company and the natural gas distribution utility or through long term wholesale agreement for the traditional electric operating company and southern power further higher cost that are recovered through regulated rate could contribute to reduced demand for energy which could negatively affect result of operation cash flow and financial condition additionally many commercial and industrial customer may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirement which for some may have the potential to ultimately affect their demand for electricity or natural gas the southern company system may be exposed to regulatory and financial risk related to the impact of ghg legislation regulation and emission reduction goal the epa ha published rule limiting emission from new modified and reconstructed fossil fuel fired electric generating unit and guideline for state to develop plan to meet epa mandated emission performance standard for existing unit known the clean power plan or cpp on august the epa published proposed rule known the affordable clean energy ace rule which is intended to replace regulation enacted in known the clean power plan cpp that would limit emission from existing fossil fuel fired electric generating unit the cpp ha been stayed by the supreme court since the ace rule would require state to develop ghg unit specific emission rate standard based on heat rate efficiency improvement for existing fossil fuel fired steam unit proposed combustion turbine including natural gas combined cycle are not affected source of january the southern company system ha ownership interest in fossil fuel fired steam unit to which the proposed ace rule is applicable the ultimate impact of this rule to the southern company system is currently unknown and will depend on change between the proposal and the final rule subsequent state plan development and requirement and any associated legal challenge the epa also ha proposed review of final rule adopted in to establish performance standard for new modified and reconstructed electric utility generating unit the impact of any change will depend on the content of any final rule adopted by the epa and the outcome of any related legal challenge in april southern company established an intermediate goal of reduction in carbon emission from level by and long term goal of low to no carbon

system increase the use of natural gas for generation complete ongoing construction project including georgia power interest in plant vogtle unit and invest in energy efficiency and continue research and development effort focused on technology to lower ghg emission the southern company system ability to achieve these goal also will be dependent on many external factor including supportive national energy policy low natural gas price and the development deployment and advancement of relevant energy technology cost associated with ghg legislation regulation and emission reduction goal could be significant however the ultimate impact will depend on various factor such state adoption and implementation of requirement low natural gas price the development deployment and advancement of relevant energy technology the ability to recover cost through existing ratemaking provision and the outcome of pending and or future legal challenge because natural gas is fossil fuel with lower carbon content relative to other fossil fuel future ghg constraint including but not limited to the imposition of carbon tax may create additional demand for natural gas both for production of electricity and direct use in home and business future ghg constraint designed to minimize emission from natural gas could likewise result in increased cost to the southern company system and affect the demand for natural gas well the price charged to customer and the competitive position of natural gas table of content index to financial statementsthe net income of southern company the traditional electric operating company and southern power could be negatively impacted by change in regulation related to transmission planning process and competition in the wholesale electric market

it subsidiary revenue result of operation and financial condition the southern company system face increasing competition from other company that supply energy or generation and storage technology change in technology may make the southern company system electric generating facility owned by the traditional electric operating company and southern power le competitive southern company gas business is dependent on natural gas price remaining competitive compared to other form of energy southern company gas also face competition in it unregulated market key element of the business model of the traditional electric operating company and southern power is that generating power at central station power plant achieves economy of scale and produce power at competitive cost there are distributed generation and storage technology that produce and store power including fuel cell microturbines wind turbine solar cell and battery advance in technology or change in law or regulation could reduce the cost of these or other alternative method of producing power to level that is competitive with that of most central station power electric production or result in smaller scale more fuel efficient and or more cost effective distributed generation that allows for increased self generation by customer broader use of distributed generation by retail energy customer may also result from customer changing perception of the merit of utilizing existing generation technology or tax or other economic incentive additionally state psc or legislature may modify certain aspect of the traditional electric operating company business result of these advance in technology it is also possible that rapid advance in central station power generation technology could reduce the value of the current electric generating facility owned by the traditional electric operating company and southern power change in technology could also alter the channel through which electric customer buy or utilize power which could reduce the revenue or increase the expense of southern company the traditional electric operating company or southern power southern company gas gas marketing service is

higher operating cost and reduced net income once facility become operational ongoing capital expenditure are required to maintain reliable level of operation significant portion of the traditional electric operating company existing facility were constructed many year ago older equipment even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practice may require significant expenditure to maintain efficiency to comply with changing environmental requirement to provide safe and reliable operation and or to meet related retirement obligation the largest construction project currently underway in the southern company system is plant vogtle unit and plant vogtle unit and construction and rate recoverybackgroundin the georgia psc certified construction of plant vogtle unit and georgia power hold ownership interest in plant vogtle unit and in the nrc issued the related combined construction and operating license which allowed full construction of the two nuclear unit with electric generating capacity of approximately mws each and related facility to begin until march construction on plant vogtle unit and continued under the vogtle and agreement which wa substantially fixed price agreement in march the epc contractor filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code in connection with the epc contractor bankruptcy filing georgia power acting for

schedule will continue to increase significantly throughout to meet these increasing monthly target existing craft construction productivity must improve and additional craft laborer must be retained and deployed table of content index to financial statementsgeorgia power and southern nuclear believe it is leading practice in connection with construction project of this size and complexity to periodically validate recent construction progress in comparison to the projected schedule and to verify and update quantity of commodity remaining to install labor productivity and forecasted staffing need this verification process led by southern nuclear wa underway of december and is expected to be completed during the second quarter georgia power currently not anticipate any material change to the total estimated project capital cost forecast for plant vogtle unit and or the expected in service date of november and november respectively resulting from this verification process however the ultimate impact on cost and schedule if any will not be known until the verification process is completed georgia power is required to report the result and any project impact to the georgia psc by may there have been technical and procedural challenge to the construction and licensing of plant vogtle unit and at the federal and state level and additional challenge may arise process are in place that are designed to assure compliance with the requirement specified in the westinghouse design control document and the combined construction and operating license including inspection by southern nuclear and the nrc that occur throughout construction result of such compliance process certain license amendment request have been filed and approved or are pending before the nrc various design and other licensing based compliance matter including the timely resolution of itaac and the related approval by the nrc may arise which may result in additional license amendment or require other resolution if any license amendment request or other licensing based compliance issue are not resolved in timely manner there may be delay in the project schedule that could result in increased cost the ultimate outcome of these matter can not be determined at this time however any extension of the project schedule is currently estimated to result in additional base capital cost of approximately million per month based on georgia power ownership interest and afudc of approximately million per month while georgia power is not precluded from seeking recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery any further change to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated

georgia court of appeal georgia power belief the appeal ha no merit however an adverse outcome in the appeal combined with subsequent adverse action by the georgia psc could have material impact on southern company and georgia power result of operation financial condition and liquidity in preparation for it nineteenth vcm filing georgia power requested southern nuclear to perform full cost reforecast for the project this reforecast performed prior to the nineteenth vcm filing resulted in billion increase to the base capital cost forecast reported in the second quarter this base cost increase primarily resulted from changed assumption related to the finalization of contract scope and management responsibility for bechtel and over subcontractor labor productivity rate and craft labor incentive well the related level of project management oversight and support including field supervision and engineering support although georgia power belief these incremental cost are reasonable and necessary to complete the project and the georgia psc order in the seventeenth vcm proceeding specifically state that the construction of plant vogtle unit and is not subject to cost cap georgia power did not seek rate recovery for these cost increase included in the current base capital cost forecast or any related financing cost in the nineteenth vcm report in connection with future vcm filing georgia power may request the georgia psc to evaluate cost currently included in the construction contingency estimate for rate recovery and when they are appropriately included in the base capital cost forecast after considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of cost included in the construction contingency estimate since the ultimate outcome of these matter is subject to the outcome of future assessment by management well georgia psc decision in these future regulatory proceeding georgia power recorded total pre tax charge to income of billion billion after tax in the second quarter which includes the total increase in the base capital cost forecast and construction contingency estimate the ultimate outcome of these matter can not be determined at this time see note to the financial statement under georgia power nuclear construction in item herein for additional information regarding plant vogtle unit and southern company gas significant investment in pipeline and pipeline development project involve financial and execution risk southern company gas ha made significant investment in existing pipeline and pipeline development project many of the existing pipeline are and when completed many of the pipeline development project will be operated by third party if one of these agent fails to perform in proper manner the value of the investment could decline and southern company gas could lose part or all of it investment in addition from time to time southern company gas may be required to contribute additional capital to pipeline joint venture or guarantee the obligation of such joint venture with respect to certain pipeline development project southern company gas will rely on it joint venture partner for construction management and will not exercise direct control over the process all of the pipeline development project are dependent on contractor for the successful and timely completion of the project further the development of pipeline project involves numerous regulatory environmental construction safety political and legal uncertainty and may require the expenditure of significant amount of capital these project may not be completed on schedule at the budgeted cost or at all there may be cost overrun and construction difficulty that cause southern company gas capital expenditure to exceed it initial expectation moreover southern company gas income will not increase immediately upon the expenditure of fund on pipeline project pipeline construction occurs over an extended period of time and southern company gas will not receive material increase in income until the project is placed in service work continues with state and federal agency to obtain the required permit to begin construction on the penneast pipeline any material delay may impact forecasted capital expenditure and the expected in service date the atlantic coast pipeline ha experienced challenge to it permit since construction began in during the third and fourth quarter ferc stop work order together with delay in obtaining permit necessary for construction and construction delay due to judicial action impacted the cost and schedule for the project result total project cost estimate have increased and the operator of the joint venture currently expects to achieve late in service date for at least table of content index to financial statementskey segment of the atlantic coast pipeline while the remainder may extend into early abnormal weather work delay including due to judicial or regulatory action and other condition may result in additional cost or schedule modification which could result in an impairment of southern company gas investment and could have material impact on southern company and southern company gas financial statement the ultimate outcome of these matter can not be determined at this time and the occurrence of these or any other of the foregoing event could adversely affect the result of operation cash flow and financial condition of southern company gas and southern company financial economic and market risksthe electric generation and energy marketing operation of the traditional electric operating company and southern power and the natural gas operation of southern company gas are subject to risk many of which are beyond their control including change in energy price and fuel cost which may reduce revenue and increase cost the generation energy marketing and natural gas operation of the southern company system are subject to change in energy price and fuel cost which could increase the cost of producing power decrease the amount received from the sale of energy and or make electric generating facility le competitive the market price for these commodity may fluctuate significantly over relatively short period of time among the factor that could influence energy price and fuel cost are prevailing market price for coal natural gas uranium fuel oil biomass and other fuel applicable used in the generation facility of the traditional electric operating company and southern power and in the case of natural gas distributed by southern company gas including associated transportation cost and supply of such commodity demand for energy and the extent of additional supply of energy available from current or new competitor liquidity in the general wholesale electricity and natural gas market weather condition impacting demand for electricity and natural gas seasonality transmission or transportation constraint disruption or inefficiency availability of competitively priced alternative energy source forced or unscheduled plant outage for the southern company system it competitor or third party provider the financial condition of market participant the economy in the southern company system service territory the nation and worldwide including the impact of economic condition on demand for electricity and the demand for fuel including natural gas natural disaster war embargo physical or cyber attack and other catastrophic event and federal state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation these factor could increase the expense and or reduce the revenue of the registrant for the traditional electric operating company and southern company gas regulated gas distribution operation such impact may not be fully recoverable through rate historically the traditional electric operating company and southern company gas from time to time have experienced underrecovered fuel and or purchased gas cost balance and may experience such balance in the future while the traditional electric operating company and southern company gas are generally authorized to recover fuel and or purchased gas cost through cost recovery clause recovery may be denied if cost are deemed to be imprudently incurred and delay in the authorization of such recovery both of which could negatively impact the cash flow of the affected traditional electric operating company or southern company gas and of southern company the registrant are subject to risk associated with changing economic environment customer behavior including increased energy conservation and adoption pattern of technology by the customer of the subsidiary registrant the consumption and use of energy are fundamentally linked to economic activity this relationship is affected over time by change in the economy customer behavior and technology any economic downturn could negatively impact customer growth and usage per customer thus reducing the sale of energy and revenue additionally any economic downturn or disruption of financial market both nationally and internationally could negatively affect the financial stability of customer and counterparties of the subsidiary registrant outside of economic disruption change in customer behavior in response to energy efficiency program changing condition and preference or change in the adoption of technology could affect the relationship of economic activity to the consumption of energy both federal and state program exist to influence how customer use energy and several of the traditional electric operating company and southern company gas have psc or other applicable state regulatory agency mandate to promote energy efficiency conservation program could impact the financial result of the registrant in different way for example if any traditional electric operating company or southern company gas is required to invest in conservation measure that result in table of content index to financial statementsreduced sale from effective conservation regulatory lag in adjusting rate for the impact of these measure could have negative financial impact on such traditional electric operating company or southern company gas and southern company customer could also voluntarily reduce their consumption of energy in response to decrease in their disposable income increase in energy price or individual conservation effort in addition the adoption of technology by customer can have both positive and negative impact on sale many new technology utilize le energy than in the past however electric and natural gas technology such electric and natural gas vehicle can create additional demand the southern company system us best available method and experience to incorporate the effect of change in customer behavior state and federal program psc or other applicable state regulatory agency mandate and technology but the southern company system planning process may not appropriately estimate and incorporate these effect all of the factor discussed above could adversely affect registrant result of operation financial condition and liquidity the operating result of the registrant are affected by weather condition and may fluctuate on seasonal and quarterly basis in addition catastrophic event such fire earthquake hurricane tornado flood drought and storm could result in substantial damage to or limit the operation of the property of subsidiary registrant and could negatively impact result of operation financial condition and liquidity electric power and natural gas supply are generally seasonal business in many part of the country demand for power peak during the summer month with market price also peaking at that time in other area power demand peak during the winter month while the electric power sale of some of the traditional electric operating company peak in the summer others peak in the winter in the aggregate electric power sale peak during the summer with smaller peak during the winter additionally southern power ha variability in it revenue from renewable generation facility due to seasonal weather pattern primarily from wind and sun in most of the area southern company gas serf natural gas demand peak during the winter result the overall operating result of the registrant may fluctuate substantially on seasonal basis in addition the subsidiary registrant have historically sold le power and natural gas when weather condition are milder unusually mild weather in the future could reduce the revenue net income and available cash of the affected registrant further volatile or significant weather event could result in substantial damage to the transmission and distribution line of the traditional electric operating company the generating facility of the traditional electric operating company and southern power and the natural gas distribution and storage facility of southern company gas the subsidiary registrant have significant investment in the atlantic and gulf coast region and southern power and southern company gas have investment in various state which could be subject to severe weather and natural disaster including wildfire further severe drought condition can reduce the availability of water and restrict or prevent the operation of certain generating facility there have been multiple significant hurricane in the southern company system service territory in recent year in the event traditional electric operating company or southern company gas experience any of these weather event or any natural disaster or other catastrophic event recovery of cost in excess of reserve and insurance coverage is subject to the approval of it state psc or other applicable state regulatory agency historically the traditional electric operating company from time to time have experienced deficit in their storm cost recovery reserve balance and may experience such deficit in the future for example at december georgia power had substantial underrecovered balance in it storm cost recovery balance result of multiple recent significant hurricane in it service territory any denial by the applicable state psc or other applicable state regulatory agency or delay in recovery of any portion of such cost could have material negative impact on traditional electric operating company or southern company gas and on southern company result of operation financial condition and liquidity in addition damage resulting from significant weather event within the service territory of any traditional electric operating company or southern company gas or affecting southern power customer may result in the loss of customer and reduced demand for energy for extended period and may impact customer ability to perform under existing ppas see note to the financial statement under revenue concentration of

gas capital and nicor gas including capital structure regulatory environment the ability to cover liquidity requirement and other commitment for capital the registrant southern company gas capital and nicor gas could experience downgrade in their rating if any rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial risk of the industry or the applicable company ha deteriorated change in rating methodology by the agency could also have negative impact on credit rating if one or more rating agency downgrade any registrant southern company gas capital or nicor gas borrowing table of content index to financial statementscosts likely would increase including automatic increase in interest rate under applicable term loan and credit facility the pool of investor and funding source would likely decrease and particularly for any downgrade to below investment grade significant collateral requirement may be triggered in number of contract any credit rating downgrade could require altering the mix of debt financing currently used and could require the issuance of secured indebtedness and or indebtedness with additional restrictive covenant binding the applicable company uncertainty in demand for energy can result in lower earnings or higher cost if demand for energy fall short of expectation it could result in potentially stranded asset if demand for energy exceeds expectation it could result in increased cost for purchasing capacity in the open market or building additional electric generation and transmission facility or natural gas distribution and storage facility southern company the traditional electric operating company and southern power each engage in long term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of new generation asset required to serve future load obligation southern company gas engages in long term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of building new pipeline and storage facility replacing existing pipeline rewatering storage facility and entering new market and or expanding in existing market these planning process must look many year into the future in order to accommodate the long lead time associated with the permitting and construction of new generation and associated transmission facility and natural gas distribution and storage facility inherent risk exists in predicting demand future load are dependent on many uncertain factor including economic condition customer usage pattern efficiency program and customer technology adoption because regulator may not permit the traditional electric operating company or southern company gas regulated operating company to adjust rate to recover the cost of new generation and associated transmission asset and or new pipeline and related infrastructure in timely manner or at all southern company and it subsidiary may not be able to fully recover these cost or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of cost and the recovery in customer rate in addition under southern power model of selling capacity and energy at negotiated market based rate under long term ppas southern power might not be able to fully execute it business plan if market price drop below original forecast southern power and or the traditional electric operating company may not be able to extend existing ppas or find new buyer for existing generation asset existing ppas expire or they may be forced to market these asset at price lower than originally intended these situation could have negative impact on net income and cash flow for the affected registrant the traditional electric operating company are currently obligated to supply power to retail customer and wholesale customer under long term ppas southern power is currently obligated to supply power to wholesale customer under long term ppas at peak time the demand for power required to meet this obligation could exceed the southern company system available generation capacity market or competitive force may require that the traditional electric operating company purchase capacity on the open market or build additional generation and transmission facility and that southern power purchase energy or capacity on the open market because regulator may not permit the traditional electric operating company to pas all of these purchase or construction cost on to their customer the traditional electric operating company may not be able to recover some or all of these cost or may have exposure to regulatory

progress toward the goal of restoring natural visibility condition in certain area including national park and wilderness area state must submit revised state implementation plan sip to the epa demonstrating continued reasonable progress towards achieving visibility improvement goal these plan could require reduction in certain pollutant such particulate matter and nox which could result in increased compliance cost the epa approved the regional progress sip for the state of alabama and georgia but only issued limited approval of the regional progress sip for the state of mississippi because mississippi must revise the best available retrofit technology bart provision of it sip therefore mississippi power plant daniel is the only electric generating unit in the southern company

pond pursuant to the ccr rule the southern company system recorded aros for each ccr unit in further analysis wa performed and closure detail were developed the traditional electric operating company have continued to periodically update these cost estimate discussed further below the epa published certain amendment to the ccr rule which became effective august these amendment extend the date from april to october to cease sending ccr and other waste stream to ash pond that demonstrate compliance with all except two of the specified performance criterion on august the court of appeal for the district of columbia circuit issued decision suggesting the epa should regulate previously excluded inactive ash pond located at retired generation facility and questioning both the ability of unlined ash pond to continue operating no matter the performance criterion result and the classification of clay lined landfill and ash pond these development could impact the expected timing of the traditional electric operating company landfill and ash pond closure activity but the extent of any impact will depend on the outcome of ongoing litigation anticipated epa rulemaking action to establish further guidance and the outcome of any legal challenge in june alabama power recorded an increase of approximately billion to it aros related to the ccr rule the revised cost estimate were based on information from feasibility study performed on ash pond in use at plant operated by alabama power including at plant jointly owned by mississippi power during the second quarter alabama power management completed it analysis of these study which indicated that additional closure cost primarily related to increase in estimated ash volume water management requirement and design revision will be required to close these ash pond under the planned closure in place methodology the level of work becomes more defined in the next month it is likely that these cost estimate will change and the change could be material in december georgia power recorded an increase of approximately billion to it aros related to the ccr rule and the related state rule during the second half of georgia power completed strategic assessment related to it plan to close the ash pond at all of it generating plant in compliance with the ccr rule and the related state rule this assessment included engineering and constructability study related to design assumption for ash pond closure and advanced engineering method the result indicated that additional closure cost will be required to close these ash pond primarily due to change in closure strategy the estimated amount of ash to be excavated and additional water management requirement necessary to support closure strategy these factor also impact the estimated timing of future cash outlay the traditional electric operating company expect to periodically update their aro cost estimate absent continued recovery of aro cost through

period in which the liability is incurred the estimated cost are capitalized part of the related long lived asset and depreciated over the asset useful life in the absence of quoted market price aros are estimated using present value technique in which estimate of future cash outlay associated with the asset retirement are discounted using credit adjusted risk free rate estimate of the timing and amount of future cash outlay are based on projection of when and how the asset will be retired and the cost of future removal activity the liability for aros primarily relates to the decommissioning of alabama power nuclear facility plant farley and facility that are subject to the ccr rule and the related state rule principally ash pond in addition alabama power ha aros related to various landfill site underground storage tank asbestos removal related to ongoing repair and maintenance disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformer and disposal of sulfur hexafluoride gas in certain substation breaker alabama power also ha identified retirement obligation related to certain transmission and distribution facility asbestos containing material within long term asset not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activity and certain wireless communication tower however liability for the removal of these asset have not been recorded because the settlement timing for the retirement obligation related to these asset is indeterminable and therefore the fair value of the retirement obligation can not be reasonably estimated liability for these retirement obligation will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support reasonable estimation of the retirement obligation the cost estimate for aros related to the disposal of ccr are based on information using various assumption related to closure and post closure cost timing of future cash outlay inflation and discount rate and the potential method for complying with the ccr rule

rate expected long term return on plan asset mortality rate expected salary and wage increase and other factor component of pension and other postretirement benefit expense include interest and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plan expected return on plan asset and amortization of certain unrecognized cost and obligation actual result that differ from the assumption utilized are accumulated and amortized over future period and therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future period while alabama power belief that the assumption used are appropriate difference in actual experience or significant change in assumption would affect it pension and other postretirement benefit cost and obligation key element in determining alabama power pension and other postretirement benefit expense are the expected long term return on plan asset and the discount rate used to measure the benefit plan obligation and the periodic benefit plan expense for future period the expected long term return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan asset is based on southern company investment strategy historical experience and expectation for long term rate of return that consider external actuarial advice southern company determines the long term return on plan asset by applying the long term rate of expected return on various asset class to southern company target asset allocation for purpose of determining alabama power liability related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plan southern company discount the future related cash flow using single point discount rate developed from the weighted average of market observed yield for high quality fixed income security with maturity that correspond to expected benefit payment basis point change in any significant assumption discount rate salary increase or long term rate of return on plan asset would result in million or

benefit plan alabama power recorded pension cost of million million and million in and respectively postretirement benefit cost for alabama power were million million and million in and respectively

performance criterion however the georgia department of natural resource ha not incorporated these amendment into it state ccr rule on august the court of appeal for the district of columbia circuit issued decision suggesting the epa should regulate previously excluded inactive ash pond located at retired generation facility and questioning both the ability of unlined ash pond to continue operating no matter the performance criterion result and the classification of clay lined landfill and ash pond these development could impact the expected timing of georgia power landfill and ash

initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale or other issue could arise and change the projected schedule and estimated cost monthly construction production target required to maintain the current project schedule will continue to increase significantly throughout to meet these increasing monthly target existing craft construction productivity must improve and additional craft laborer must be retained and deployed georgia power and southern nuclear believe it is leading practice in connection with construction project of this size and complexity to periodically

part of the related long lived asset and depreciated over the asset useful life in the absence of quoted market price aros are estimated using present value technique in which estimate of future cash outlay associated with the asset retirement are discounted using credit adjusted risk free rate estimate of the timing and amount of future cash outlay are based on projection of when and how the asset will be retired and the cost of future removal activity the liability for aros primarily relates to the decommissioning of georgia power nuclear facility which include georgia power ownership interest in plant hatch and plant vogtle unit and and facility that are subject to the ccr rule and the related state rule principally ash pond in addition georgia power ha aros related to various

polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformer leasehold improvement equipment on customer property and property associated with georgia power rail line and natural gas pipeline however liability for the removal of these asset have not been recorded because the settlement timing for the retirement obligation related to these asset is indeterminable and therefore the fair value of the retirement obligation can not be reasonably estimated liability for these retirement obligation will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support reasonable estimation of the retirement obligation georgia power previously recorded aros result of state requirement in georgia which closely align with the requirement of the ccr rule discussed above the cost estimate for aros related to the disposal of ccr are based on information using various assumption related to closure and post closure cost timing of future cash outlay inflation and discount rate and the potential method for complying with the ccr rule and the related state rule in december georgia power recorded an increase of approximately billion to it aros related to the disposal of ccr result of strategic assessment which indicated additional closure cost will be required to close the ash pond primarily due to change in closure strategy the estimated amount of ash to be excavated and additional water

future period while georgia power belief that the assumption used are appropriate difference in actual experience or significant change in assumption would affect it pension and other postretirement benefit cost and obligation key element in determining georgia power pension and other postretirement benefit expense are the expected long term return on plan asset and the discount rate used to

perform under the term of the contract or the inability to deploy wind turbine equipment to development project if an indicator exists the asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the asset carrying value to the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flow directly attributable to the asset if the estimate of undiscounted future cash flow is le than the carrying value of the asset the fair value of the asset is determined and loss is recorded high degree of judgment is required in developing estimate related to these evaluation which are based on projection of various factor
