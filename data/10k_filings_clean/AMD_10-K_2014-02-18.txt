to this portion of our business the continued improvement of the quality of intel integrated graphic along with higher unit shipment of our apus may drive computer manufacturer to reduce the number of system they build paired with discrete graphic component particularly for notebook because they may offer satisfactory graphic performance for most mainstream pc user at lower cost intel could take action that place our discrete gpus and integrated chipsets at competitive disadvantage such giving one or more of our competitor in the graphic and visual solution market such nvidia corporation preferential access to it proprietary graphic interface or other useful information other than intel our principal competitor in the graphic and visual solution market is nvidia amd and nvidia are the two principal player offering discrete graphic solution other competitor include number of smaller company which may have greater flexibility to address specific market need but le financial resource to do so especially we believe that the growing complexity of visual processor and the associated research and development cost represent an increasingly higher barrier to entry in this market with respect to our game console product we compete primarily against nvidia other competitor include intel arm holding and imagination technology group research and development we focus our research and development activity on improving and enhancing product design one main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of product with greater system level integration of the cpu and gpu and transforming our product into socs with in each case improved system performance and performance per watt characteristic for example we are focusing on improving the battery life of our microprocessor and apu product for notebook and tablet and the power efficiency of our microprocessor for server we are also focusing on delivering range of low power integrated platform to serve key market including commercial client mobile computing and gaming and medium computing well developing an hsa which is designed for software developer to easily program apus by combining scalar processing on the cpu with parallel processing on the gpu all while providing high bandwidth access to memory at low power we believe that these integrated platform will bring customer better time to market and increased performance and energy efficiency we also work with industry leader on process technology software and other functional intellectual property and we work with others in the industry public foundation university and industry consortium to conduct early stage research and development our research and development expense for and were approximately billion billion and billion respectively for more information see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation or md we conduct product and system research and development activity for our product in the united state with additional design and development engineering team located in china canada india singapore taiwan and israel table of content manufacturing arrangement and assembly and test facility third party wafer foundry facility globalfoundries inc on march we entered into wafer supply agreement the wsa with globalfoundries inc gf the wsa governs the term by which we purchase product manufactured by gf related party to pursuant to the wsa we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and apu product requirement from gf with limited exception if we acquire third party business that manufacture microprocessor and apu product we will have up to two year to transition the manufacture of such microprocessor and apu product to gf the wsa terminates no later than march gf ha agreed to use commercially reasonable effort to assist to transition the supply of product to another provider and to continue to fulfill purchase order for up to two year following the termination or expiration of the wsa during the transition period pricing for microprocessor and apu product will remain set forth in the wsa but our purchase commitment to gf will no longer apply on april we entered into first amendment to the wsa the primary effect of the first amendment wa to change the pricing methodology applicable to wafer delivered in for our microprocessor and apu product the first amendment also modified our existing commitment regarding the production of certain gpu and chipset product at gf on march we entered into second amendment to the wsa the primary effect of the second amendment wa to modify certain pricing and other term of the wsa applicable to wafer for our microprocessor and apu product to be delivered by gf to during under the term of the second amendment to the wsa gf granted right to contract with another wafer foundry supplier with respect to specified product for specified period of time the limited waiver of exclusivity in consideration for the limited waiver of exclusivity we recorded charge of million in the first quarter of consisting of million cash payment and million non cash charge representing the transfer to gf of our remaining investment in gf at fair value on december we entered into third amendment to the wsa pursuant to the third amendment we modified our wafer purchase commitment for the fourth quarter of made pursuant to the second amendment to the wsa in addition we agreed to certain pricing and other term of the wsa applicable to wafer for our microprocessor and apu product to be delivered by gf to from the fourth quarter of through december pursuant to the third amendment gf agreed to waive portion of our wafer purchase commitment for the fourth quarter of in consideration for this waiver we agreed to pay gf fee of million result we recorded lower of cost or market charge of million for the write of inventory to it market value in the fourth quarter of the cash impact of this million fee wa paid over several quarter with million paid on december million paid on april and million paid on december we are currently in the process of negotiating fourth amendment to the wsa and we expect that our future purchase from gf will continue to be material gf currently manufacture our microprocessor on millimeter wafer in technology ranging from to smaller process geometry can lead to gain in performance lower power consumption and lower per unit manufacturing cost we continue to have our product manufactured on more advanced process technology because using more advanced process technology can contribute to lower product manufacturing cost and improve product performance and power efficiency taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company we also have foundry arrangement with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc for the production of certain graphic processor and chipsets embedded processor and apu product we are in production in tsmc millimeter fabrication facility in technology ranging from to table of content other third party manufacturer we outsource board level graphic product manufacturing to third party manufacturer we also outsource board level and system level product manufacturing to third party manufacturer for our seamicro dense server and storage product assembly test mark and packaging facility we own and operate two assembly test mark

wafer for our product are delivered from third party foundry to our test assembly and packaging partner located in the asia pacific region who package and test the final semiconductor product intellectual property and licensing we rely on contract and intellectual property right to protect our product and technology from unauthorized third party copying and use intellectual property right include copyright patent patent application trademark trade secret and maskwork right of december we approximately patent in the united state and approximately patent application pending in the united state in certain case we have filed corresponding application in foreign jurisdiction we expect to file future patent application in both the united state and abroad on significant invention we deem appropriate we do not believe that any individual patent or the expiration of any patent is or would be material to our business is typical in the semiconductor industry we have numerous cross licensing and technology exchange agreement with other company under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property right one such agreement is the cross license agreement that we entered into with intel on november under the cross license agreement intel ha granted to and our subsidiary and we have granted intel and it subsidiary non exclusive royalty free license to all patent that are either owned or controlled by the party at any time that have first effective filing date or priority date prior to the five year anniversary of the effective date of the cross license agreement referred to the capture period to make have made use sell offer to sell import and otherwise dispose of certain semiconductor and electronic related product anywhere in the world under the cross license agreement intel ha right to make semiconductor product for third party but the third party product design are not licensed result of such manufacture we have right to perform assembly and testing for third party but not right to make semiconductor product for third party the term of the cross license agreement continues the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patent unless earlier terminated party can terminate the cross license agreement or the right and license of the other party if the other party materially breach the cross license agreement and not correct the noticed material breach within day upon such termination the terminated party license right terminate but the terminating party license right continue subject to that party continued compliance with the term of the cross license agreement the cross license agreement and the capture period will automatically terminate if party undergoes change of control defined in the cross license agreement and both party license will terminate upon the bankruptcy of party that party may assume but may not assign the cross license agreement and in the event that the cross license agreement can not be assumed the cross license agreement and the license granted will terminate table of content backlog sale are made primarily pursuant to purchase order for current delivery or agreement covering purchase over period of time some of these order or agreement may be revised or canceled without penalty generally in light of current industry practice we do not believe that such order or agreement provide meaningful backlog figure or are necessarily indicative of actual sale for any succeeding period seasonality our operating result tend to vary seasonally for example historically first quarter pc product sale are generally lower than fourth quarter sale in addition with respect to our semi custom soc product for game console we expect sale pattern to follow the seasonal trend of consumer business with sale in the first half of the year lower than sale in the second half of the year employee of december we had approximately employee environmental regulation many aspect of our business operation and product are regulated by domestic and international environmental law and regulation these regulation include limitation on discharge of pollutant to air water and soil remediation requirement product chemical content limitation manufacturing chemical use and handling restriction pollution control requirement waste minimization consideration and requirement with respect to treatment transport storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste if we fail to comply with any applicable environmental regulation we may be subject to fine suspension of production alteration of our manufacturing process import export restriction sale limitation and or criminal and civil liability existing or future regulation could require to procure expensive pollution abatement or remediation equipment to modify product design or to incur other expense to comply with environmental regulation any failure to adequately control the use disposal storage or discharge of hazardous substance could expose to future liability that could have material adverse effect on our business we believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental requirement and do not expect those requirement to result in material expenditure in the foreseeable future environmental law are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time for example the european union eu and china are two among growing number of jurisdiction that have enacted restriction on the use of lead and other material in electronic product other country have also implemented similar restriction these regulation affect semiconductor device and packaging regulation restricting material in electronic product continue to increase around the world there is risk that the cost quality and manufacturing yield of product that are subject to these restriction may be le favorable compared to product that are not subject to such restriction or that the transition to compliant product may produce sudden change in demand which may result in excess inventory recent legislation requires disclosure and reporting requirement for company who use conflict mineral that originate from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining country we will likely incur additional cost associated with complying with these requirement such cost related to determining the source of any conflict mineral used in our product auditing the process and reporting to our customer and the government also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenge if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origin of the subject mineral moreover we are likely to encounter challenge to satisfy those customer who require that all of the component of our product are certified conflict free and if we can not satisfy these customer they may choose competitor product in january intel announced that all of it microprocessor product are conflict free our first conflict mineral report covering the calendar year is due to the sec by june table of content number of jurisdiction including the eu australia and china are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulation for computer and server based on energy star specification well additional energy consumption limit there is the potential for certain of our product being excluded from some of these market which could materially adversely affect while we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditure we can not assure you that future environmental legal requirement will not become more stringent or costly in the future therefore we can not assure you that our cost of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety law and our liability arising from past and future release of or exposure to hazardous substance will not have material adverse effect on see also item legal proceeding environmental matter below table of content item risk factor the risk and uncertainty described below are not the only one we face if any of the following risk actually occurs our business financial condition or result of operation could be materially adversely affected in addition you should consider the interrelationship and compounding effect of two or more risk occurring simultaneously intel corporation dominance of the microprocessor market and it aggressive business practice may limit our ability to compete effectively intel corporation ha dominated the market for microprocessor for many year intel market share margin and significant financial resource enable it to market it product aggressively to target our customer and our channel partner with special incentive and to discipline customer who do business with these aggressive activity have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sale and lower average selling price for our product and adversely affect our margin and profitability intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturer and their channel of distribution through various brand and other marketing program result of intel dominant position in the microprocessor market intel ha been able to control microprocessor and computer system standard and benchmark and to dictate the type of product the microprocessor market requires of intel also dominates the computer system platform which includes core logic chipsets graphic chip motherboards and other component necessary to assemble computer system oems that purchase microprocessor for computer system are highly dependent on intel le innovative on their own and to large extent are distributor of intel technology additionally intel is able to drive de facto standard for microprocessor that could cause and other company to have delayed access to such standard intel ha substantially greater financial resource than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amount on marketing and research and development than we do we expect intel to maintain it dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing research and development new manufacturing facility and other technology company to the extent intel manufacture significantly larger portion of it microprocessor product using more advanced process technology or introduces competitive new product into the market before we do we may be more vulnerable to intel aggressive marketing and pricing strategy for microprocessor product for example intel recently introduced microprocessor for low cost notebook similar to product that we offer for low cost notebook intel also leverage it dominance in the microprocessor market to sell it integrated graphic chipsets intel manufacture and sell integrated graphic chipsets bundled with their microprocessor and is dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business intel could also take action that place our discrete gpus at competitive disadvantage including giving one or more of our competitor in the graphic and visual solution market such nvidia corporation preferential access to it proprietary graphic interface or other useful information long intel remains in this dominant position we may be materially adversely affected by intel business practice including rebating and allocation strategy and pricing action designed to limit our market share and margin product mix and introduction schedule product bundling marketing and merchandising strategy exclusivity payment to it current and potential customer and channel partner table of content control over industry standard pc manufacturer and other pc industry participant including motherboard memory chipset and basic input output system or bios supplier and software company well the graphic interface for intel platform and marketing and advertising expenditure in support of positioning the intel brand over the brand of it oem customer intel dominant position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphic chipset market it introduction of competitive new product it existing relationship with top tier oems and it aggressive marketing and pricing strategy could result in lower unit sale and lower average selling price for our product which could have material adverse effect on the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce product on timely basis with feature and performance level that provide value to our customer while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transition our success depends to significant extent on the development qualification implementation and acceptance of new product design and improvement that provide value to our customer our ability to develop qualify and distribute and have manufactured new product and related technology to meet evolving industry requirement at price acceptable to our customer and on timely basis are significant factor in determining our competitiveness in our target market for example form factor have increasingly shifted from desktop pc and notebook to tablet and tablet have been one of the fastest growing form factor historically significant portion of our computing solution revenue ha been related to desktop pc currently significant portion of our business is focused on the consumer pc portion of the market and we believe that pc market condition will remain challenging consumer adopt new form factor and have different requirement than those consumer in the pc market pc sale could be negatively impacted which could negatively impact our business if we fail to or are delayed in developing qualifying or shipping new product or technology that provide value to our customer and address these new trend or if we fail to predict which new form factor consumer will adopt we may lose competitive positioning which could cause to lose market share and require to discount the selling price of our product although we make substantial investment in research and development we can not be certain that we will be able to develop obtain or successfully implement new product and technology on timely basis delay in developing qualifying or shipping new product can also cause to miss our customer product design window or in some case breach contractual obligation or cause to pay penalty if our customer do not include our product in the initial design of their computer system or product they will typically not use our product in their system or product until at least the next design configuration the process of being qualified for inclusion in customer system or product can be lengthy and could cause to further miss cycle in the demand of end user which also could result in loss of market share and harm our business moreover market demand requires that product incorporate new feature and performance standard on an industry wide basis over the life of specific product the sale price is typically reduced over time the introduction of new product and enhancement to existing product is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price if we are unable to introduce new product with sufficiently high sale price or to increase unit sale volume capable of offsetting the reduction in the sale price of existing product over time our business could be materially adversely affected table of content if we can not generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing we may face cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investment in research and development or other strategic investment our ability to fund research and development expenditure depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operation and the availability of external financing if necessary our research and development expenditure together with ongoing operating expense will be substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balance if new competitor technological advance by existing competitor or other competitive factor require to invest significantly greater resource than anticipated in our research and development effort our operating expense would increase if we are required to invest significantly greater resource than anticipated in research and development effort without an increase in revenue our operating result could decline we regularly ass market for external financing opportunity including debt and equity financing additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or if available may not be available on satisfactory term the health of the credit market may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed any downgrade from credit rating agency such moody or standard poor may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the term of such financing in addition credit agency downgrade or concern regarding our credit worthiness may impact relationship with our supplier who may limit our credit line for example in the first quarter of moody lowered our senior unsecured debt rating to from and standard poor lowered our senior unsecured debt rating to from bb our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operation may require to abandon project or curtail planned investment in research and development or other strategic initiative if we curtail planned investment in research and development or abandon project our product may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected we rely on gf to manufacture most of our microprocessor and apu product if gf is not able to satisfy our manufacturing requirement our business could be adversely impacted the wsa governs the term by which we purchase product manufactured by gf pursuant to the wsa we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and apu product requirement from gf with limited exception if gf is unable to achieve anticipated manufacturing yield remain competitive using or implementing advanced leading edge process technology needed to manufacture future generation of our product manufacture our product on timely basis at competitive price or meet our capacity requirement we may experience delay in product launch supply shortage for certain product or increased cost and our business could be materially adversely affected in addition if our requirement are le than the fixed number of wafer that we agreed to purchase we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit cost both of which will adversely impact our gross margin and our result of operation we are currently in the process of negotiating fourth amendment to the wsa and we expect that our future purchase from gf will continue to be material if we do not successfully conclude our negotiation it could have material adverse impact on our gross margin and our result of operation in addition gf ha relied on advanced technology investment company atic for it funding need if atic fails to adequately fund gf on timely basis or at all gf ability to manufacture product for could be materially adversely affected we rely on third party to manufacture our product and if they are unable to do so on timely basis in sufficient quantity and using competitive technology our business could be materially adversely affected we rely on third party wafer foundry to fabricate the silicon wafer for all of our product we also rely on third party provider to assemble test mark and pack certain of our product it is important to have reliable relationship with all of these third party manufacturing supplier to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand table of content we can not assure you that these manufacturer or our other third party manufacturing supplier will be able to meet our near term or long term manufacturing requirement if we experience supply constraint from our third party manufacturing supplier we may be required to allocate the affected product amongst our customer which could have material adverse effect on our relationship with these customer and on our financial condition in addition if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing supplier it could result in lost sale and have material adverse effect on our business we do not have long term commitment contract with some of our third party manufacturing supplier we obtain some of these manufacturing service on purchase order basis and these manufacturer are not required to provide with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantity in an existing purchase order accordingly we depend on these supplier to allocate to portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our need to produce product of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yield and to deliver those product to on timely basis and at acceptable price the manufacturer we use also fabricate wafer and assemble test and package product for other company including certain of our competitor they could choose to prioritize capacity for other user increase the price that they charge on short notice or reduce or eliminate delivery to which could have material adverse effect on our business other risk associated with our dependence on third party manufacturer include limited control over delivery schedule and quality assurance lack of capacity in period of excess demand misappropriation of our intellectual property dependence on several small undercapitalized subcontractor and limited ability to manage inventory and part moreover if any of our third party manufacturing supplier suffer any damage to facility lose benefit under material agreement experience power outage lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our product encounter financial difficulty are unable to secure necessary raw material from their supplier or suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency we may encounter supply delay or disruption if we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supply of product our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business if we transition the production of some of our product to new manufacturer we may experience delayed product introduction lower yield or poorer performance of our product if we experience problem with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from particular third party manufacturing supplier or if we for other reason cease utilizing one of those supplier we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in short time frame we could experience significant delay in the shipment of our product if we are required to find alternative third party manufacturing supplier which could have material adverse effect on our business failure to achieve expected manufacturing yield for our product could negatively impact our financial result semiconductor manufacturing yield are result of both product design and process technology which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer and low yield can result from design failure process technology failure or combination of both our third party foundry are responsible for the process technology used to fabricate silicon wafer if our third party foundry experience manufacturing inefficiency or encounter disruption error or difficulty during production we may fail to achieve acceptable yield or experience product delivery delay we can not be certain that our third party foundry will be able to develop obtain or successfully implement leading edge process technology needed to manufacture future generation of our product profitably or on timely basis or that our competitor will not develop new technology product or process earlier moreover during period when foundry are implementing new process technology their manufacturing facility may not be fully productive substantial delay in the technology transition to smaller process technology could have material adverse effect on particularly if our competitor transition to more cost effective technology before any decrease in manufacturing yield could result in an increase in per unit cost which would adversely impact our gross margin and or force to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customer which could harm our relationship with our customer and reputation and materially adversely affect our business table of content we may not be able to successfully implement our long term business strategy we are implementing long term business strategy to refocus our business to address market beyond our core pc market to the faster growing ultra low power client embedded professional graphic semi custom and dense server market currently significant portion of our business is focused on the consumer pc portion of the market and we believe that pc market condition will remain challenging the goal of our long term strategy is to derive approximately of our revenue from high growth market by the end of in the third and fourth quarter of revenue from sale of our semi custom soc and embedded product represented more than of total net revenue despite our effort we may not be able to effectively implement our strategy in timely manner to exploit potential market opportunity or meet competitive challenge however if demand for these product is below our expectation or we are not able to improve cost efficiency of this business model we may not realize benefit from our long term business strategy moreover our business strategy is dependent on creating product that anticipate customer requirement and emerging industry trend we can not assure you that our new strategic direction will result in innovative product and technology that provide value to our customer in addition we may be entering market where current and new competitor may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirement and emerging technology we can not assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitor who may have stronger position in these new market we may face delay or disruption in research and development effort or we may be required to significantly invest greater resource in research and development than anticipated global economic uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating result uncertain global economic condition have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business uncertainty in the worldwide economic environment may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customer to postpone purchase for example our revenue in the second half of and in wa adversely affected in part by the overall weakness in the global economy and weak consumer demand for end user pc product which impacted sale we believe that consumer pc market condition will remain challenging in addition during challenging economic time our current or potential future customer may experience cash flow problem and result may modify delay or cancel plan to purchase our product additionally if our customer are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of account receivable that they owe the risk related to our customer potentially defaulting on or delaying payment to is increased because we expect that small number of customer will continue to account for substantial part of our revenue any inability of our current or potential future customer to pay for our product may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow moreover our key supplier may reduce their output or become insolvent thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our product in addition uncertain economic condition may make it more difficult for to raise fund through borrowing or private or public sale of debt or equity security we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligation or meet our working capital requirement our ability to make payment on and to refinance our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and is subject to prevailing economic condition and financial business and other factor many of which are beyond our control we can not assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow fund including under our senior secured asset based line of credit for principal amount up to million secured revolving line of credit in amount sufficient to enable to service our debt or to meet our working capital requirement if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operation or to borrow sufficient fund to service our debt we may be required to sell asset or equity reduce expenditure refinance all or portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing we can not assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt sell asset or equity borrow fund under our secured revolving line of credit or borrow more fund on term acceptable to if at all table of content we have substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligation our total debt of december wa billion which reflects the debt discount adjustment on our convertible senior note due note and our senior note due note our substantial indebtedness may make it difficult for to satisfy our financial obligation including making scheduled principal and interest payment limit our ability to borrow additional fund for working capital capital expenditure acquisition and general corporate and other purpose limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital capital expenditure acquisition or other general corporate purpose require to use substantial portion of our cash flow from operation to make debt service payment place at competitive disadvantage compared to our le leveraged competitor and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry condition the agreement governing our note and our secured revolving line of credit impose restriction on that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business the indenture governing our note senior note due note and senior note due note contain various covenant which limit our ability to among other thing incur additional indebtedness pay dividend and make other restricted payment make certain investment including investment in our unrestricted subsidiary create or permit certain lien create or permit restriction on the ability of certain restricted subsidiary to pay dividend or make other distribution to use the proceeds from sale of asset enter into certain type of

cash trigger period we also would be required to maintain fixed charge coverage ratio each four fiscal quarter period ending on and after march the agreement governing our note and our secured revolving line of credit contain cross default provision whereby default under one agreement would likely result in cross default under agreement covering other borrowing for example the occurrence of default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of million would cause cross default under the indenture governing our note note note and note well under our secured revolving line of credit the occurrence of default under any of these borrowing arrangement would permit the applicable note holder or the lender under our secured revolving line of credit to declare all amount outstanding under those borrowing arrangement to be immediately due and payable if the note holder or the trustee under the indenture governing our note note note or note or the lender under our secured revolving line of credit accelerate the repayment of borrowing we can not assure you that we will have sufficient asset to repay those borrowing the market in which our product are sold are highly competitive the market in which our product are sold are very competitive and delivering the latest and best product to market on timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth we believe that the main factor that determine our product competitiveness are timely product introduction product quality including enabling state of the art visual experience power consumption including battery life reliability selling price speed size or form factor cost adherence to industry standard and the creation of open industry standard software and hardware compatibility and stability and brand awareness we expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological change frequent product introduction by our competitor of product that may provide better performance or may include additional feature that render our product uncompetitive and aggressive pricing by competitor especially during challenging economic time some competitor may have greater access or right to companion technology including interface processor and memory technical information with the introduction of our apu product and other competing solution we believe that demand for additional discrete graphic card may decrease in the future due to both the improvement of the quality of our competitor integrated graphic and the graphic performance of our apus if competitor introduce competitive new product into the market before demand for our product could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected we are implementing long term business strategy to refocus our business to address market beyond our core pc market to the faster growing ultra low power client embedded professional graphic semi custom and dense server market for example our semi custom product are developed and customized for our customer particular need however we are entering market with new and different competitor who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirement and emerging technology we can not assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitor who may have stronger position in these new market or superior ability to anticipate customer requirement and emerging industry trend table of content the loss of significant customer may have material adverse effect on collectively our top five customer accounted for approximately of our net revenue in on segment basis in five customer accounted for approximately of the net revenue of our computing solution segment and five customer accounted for approximately of the net revenue of our graphic and visual solution segment we expect that small number of customer will continue to account for substantial part of revenue of our business in the future if one of our key customer decides to stop buying our product or if one of these customer materially reduces it operation or it demand for our product our business would be materially adversely affected our receipt of revenue from our semi custom soc product is dependent upon our technology being designed into third party product and the success of those product the revenue that we receive from our semi custom soc product is in the form of non recurring engineering fee charged to third party for design and development service and revenue received in connection with sale of our semi custom soc product to these third party result our ability to generate revenue from our semi custom product depends on our ability to secure customer for our semi custom design pipeline we also receive royalty paid to by third party in connection with sale of their product that incorporate our technology any revenue from sale of our semi custom soc product and any royalty revenue is directly related to sale of the third party product and reflective of their success in the market moreover we have no control over the marketing effort of these third party and we can not make any assurance that sale of their product will be successful in current or future year consequently the semi custom soc product and royalty revenue expected by may not be fully realized and our operating result may be adversely affected in addition we expect that we continue to transition to semi custom business model royalty paid to by third party in connection with sale of their product that incorporate our technology will decline the demand for our product depends in part on the market condition in the industry into which they are sold fluctuation in demand for our product or market decline in any of these industry could have material adverse effect on our result of operation significant portion of our business is currently dependent upon the market for desktop pc and notebook form factor have increasingly shifted from desktop pc and notebook to tablet with tablet being one of the fastest growing form factor historically significant portion of our computing solution revenue ha been related to desktop pc currently significant portion of our business is focused on the consumer pc portion of the market and we believe that pc market condition will remain challenging industry wide fluctuation in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected in the past and may materially adversely affect in the future for example our net revenue in the second half of and wa adversely affected in part by the overall weakness in the global economy and weak consumer demand for end user pc product which impacted sale in addition during the third and fourth quarter of we ramped sale of our semi custom soc product specifically in the third and fourth quarter of net revenue from sale of our semi custom soc and embedded product represented more than of total net revenue the success of our semi custom soc product is dependent on securing customer for our semi custom design pipeline and consumer market condition including the success of the sony playstation and microsoft xbox one game console system our ability to design and introduce new product in timely manner is dependent upon third party intellectual property in the design and development of new product and product enhancement we rely on third party intellectual property such software development tool and hardware testing tool furthermore certain product feature may rely on intellectual property acquired from third party the design requirement necessary to meet consumer demand for more feature and greater functionality from semiconductor product may exceed the table of content capability of the third party intellectual property or development tool available to if the third party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable is not available in the time frame needed for our new product or fails to produce design that meet customer demand our business could be materially adversely affected we depend on third party company for the design manufacture and supply of motherboards bios software and other computer platform component to support our microprocessor and graphic business we depend on third party company for the design manufacture and supply of motherboards bios software and other component that our customer utilize to support our microprocessor gpu and apu offering we also rely on our aibs to support our gpu and apu business in addition our microprocessor are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with intel microprocessor if the designer manufacturer aibs and supplier of motherboards and other component decrease their support for our product offering our business could be materially adversely affected if we lose microsoft corporation support for our product or other software vendor do not design and develop software to run on our product our ability to sell our product could be materially adversely affected our ability to innovate beyond the instruction set controlled by intel depends partially on microsoft designing and developing it operating system to run on or support our based microprocessor product with respect to our graphic product we depend in part on microsoft to design and develop it operating system to run on or support our graphic product similarly the success of our product in the market such our apu product is dependent on independent software provider designing and developing software to run on our product if microsoft doe not continue to design and develop it operating system so that they work with our instruction set or doe not continue to develop and maintain their operating system to support our graphic product independent software provider may forego designing their software application to take advantage of our innovation and customer may not purchase pc with our product in addition some software driver sold with our product are certified by microsoft if microsoft not certify driver or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of microsoft or other software vendor our ability to market our product would be materially adversely affected we may incur future impairment of goodwill we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis we monitor for any event or change in circumstance such significant adverse change in business climate or operating result change in management business strategy an inability to successfully introduce new product in the marketplace an inability to successfully achieve internal forecast or significant decline in our stock price which may represent an indicator of impairment the occurrence of any of these event may require to record future goodwill impairment charge our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our product development program much of our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering marketing sale and executive personnel if we are not able to continue to attract train and retain qualified personnel necessary for our business the progress of our product development program could be hindered and we could be materially adversely affected to help attract retain and motivate qualified personnel we use share based incentive award such employee stock option and non vested share unit restricted stock unit if the value of such stock award doe not appreciate measured by the performance of the price of our common stock or if our share based compensation otherwise cease to be viewed valuable benefit our ability to attract retain and motivate personnel could be weakened which could harm our result of operation in addition our recent and any future restructuring plan may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employee table of content in the event of change of control we may not be able to repurchase our outstanding debt required by the applicable indenture and our secured revolving line of credit which would result in default under the indenture and our secured revolving line of credit upon change of control we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our note note and note then outstanding at of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest if any up to but excluding the repurchase date and to offer to repurchase all of our note then outstanding at of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest if any up to but excluding the repurchase date in addition change of control would be an event of default under our secured revolving line of credit of december million wa outstanding under our secured revolving line of credit and billion wa outstanding under our note future debt agreement may contain similar provision we may not have the financial resource to repurchase our outstanding note and prepay all of our outstanding obligation under our secured revolving line of credit the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and ha experienced severe downturn that have materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our business in the future the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and ha experienced significant downturn often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change wide fluctuation in supply and demand continuous new product introduction price erosion and decline in general economic condition we have incurred substantial loss in recent downturn due to substantial decline in average selling price the cyclical nature of supply demand imbalance in the semiconductor industry decline in demand for end user product such pc that incorporate our product and excess inventory level global economic uncertainty and weakness have also impacted the semiconductor market consumer and business have deferred purchase which negatively impacted demand for our product our financial performance ha been and may in the future be negatively affected by these downturn for example our net revenue in the second half of and wa adversely affected in part by the overall weakness in the global economy and weak consumer demand for end user pc product which impacted sale we believe that consumer pc market condition will remain challenging the growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our product from high growth emerging global market our ability to be successful in such market depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure well our ability to cultivate and maintain local relationship in these market if demand from these market is below our expectation sale of our product may decrease which would have material adverse effect on our operating result are subject to quarterly and seasonal sale pattern substantial portion of our quarterly sale have historically been made in the last month of the quarter this uneven sale pattern make prediction of revenue for each financial period difficult and increase the risk of unanticipated variation in quarterly result and financial condition in addition our operating result tend to vary seasonally for example historically first quarter pc product sale are generally lower than fourth quarter sale in addition with respect to our semi custom soc product for game console we expect sale pattern to follow the seasonal trend of consumer business with sale in the first half of the year being lower than sale in the second half of the year many of the factor that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trend are beyond our control table of content if essential equipment or material are not available to manufacture our product we could be materially adversely affected we purchase equipment and material for our internal back end manufacturing operation from number of supplier and our operation depend upon obtaining delivery of adequate supply of equipment and material on timely basis our third party manufacturing supplier also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantity of equipment and material in the manufacture of our product certain equipment and material that are used in the manufacture of our product are available only from limited number of supplier we also depend on limited number of supplier to provide the majority of certain type of integrated circuit package for our microprocessor including apu product similarly certain non proprietary material or component such memory printed circuit board pcbs substrate and capacitor used in the manufacture of our product are currently available from only limited number of source because some of the equipment and material that we and our third party manufacturing supplier purchase are complex it is sometimes difficult to substitute one supplier for another from time to time supplier may extend lead time limit supply or increase price due to capacity constraint or other factor also some of these material and component may be subject to rapid change in price and availability interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortage and price increase in various essential material dependence on sole supplier or limited number of supplier exacerbates these risk if we are unable to procure certain of these material for our back end manufacturing operation or our third party foundry or manufacturing supplier are unable to procure material for manufacturing our product our business would be materially adversely affected our issuance to west coast hitech wch of warrant to purchase share of our common stock if and when exercised by wch will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholder and the conversion of the remainder of our note may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholder the warrant issued to wch became exercisable in july any issuance by of additional share to wch upon exercise of the warrant will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholder any sale in the public market by wch of any share owned by wch could adversely affect prevailing market price of our common stock and the anticipated exercise by wch of the warrant could depress the price of our common stock moreover the conversion of our remaining note may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholder the conversion of our note could have dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of our note any sale in the public market of our common stock issuable upon conversion of our note could adversely affect prevailing market price of our common stock in addition the conversion of our note into cash and share of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock if our product are not compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware we could be materially adversely affected our product may not be fully compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware further we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problem in timely manner if our customer are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware after our product are shipped in volume we could be materially adversely affected in addition the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our product could have material adverse effect on our business cost related to defective product could have material adverse effect on product complex those we offer may contain defect or failure when first introduced or when new version or enhancement to existing product are released we can not assure you that despite our testing table of content procedure error will not be found in new product or release after commencement of commercial shipment in the future which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our product material recall and replacement cost delay in recognition or loss of revenue writing down the inventory of defective product the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development effort defending against litigation related to defective product or related property damage or personal injury and damage to our reputation in the industry and could adversely affect our relationship with our customer in addition we may have difficulty identifying the end customer of the defective product in the field result we could incur substantial cost to implement modification to correct defect any of these problem could materially adversely affect our business we could be subject to potential product liability claim if one of our product cause or merely appears to have caused an injury claim may be made by consumer or others selling our product and we may be subject to claim against even if an alleged injury is due to the action of others product liability claim recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liability or for amount in excess of insured liability could have material adverse effect on our business if we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain we respond to change in customer demand for our product our business could be materially adversely affected our ability to meet customer demand for our product depends in part on our ability to deliver the product our customer want on timely basis accordingly we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing distribution and fulfillment of our product we continue to grow our business acquire new customer and strengthen relationship with existing customer the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because many of our customer tend to have specific requirement for particular product and specific time frame in which they require delivery of these product if we are unable to consistently deliver the right product to our customer on timely basis in the right location our customer may reduce the quantity they order from which could have material adverse effect on our business we outsource to third party certain supply chain logistics function including portion of our product distribution transportation management and information technology support service we rely on third party provider to operate our regional product distribution center and to manage the transportation of our work in process and finished product among our facility to our manufacturing supplier and to our customer in addition we rely on third party to provide certain information technology service to including help desk support desktop application service business and software support application server and storage administration data center operation database administration and voice video and remote access we can not guarantee that these provider will fulfill their respective responsibility in timely manner in accordance with the contract term in which case our internal operation and the distribution of our product to our customer could be materially adversely affected also we can not guarantee that our contract with these third party provider will be renewed in which case we would have to transition these function in house or secure new provider which could have material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business process and information system and modification or interruption of such system may disrupt our business process and internal control we rely upon number of internal business process and information system to support key business function and the efficient operation of these process and system is critical to our business our business process and information system need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modification or upgrade that expose to number of operational risk we are currently pursuing initiative to transform and optimize our business operation through the reengineering of certain process table of content investment in automation and engagement of strategic partner or resource to assist with certain business function these change may be costly and disruptive to our operation and could impose substantial demand on management time these change may also require change in our information system modification of internal control procedure and significant training of employee and third party resource we are currently implementing an initiative to transition certain key information technology application and business system from various amd development location to centralized consolidated data center there can be no assurance that our business and operation will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition our information technology system and those of third party information technology provider or business partner may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstance beyond our control including catastrophic event power anomaly or outage natural disaster virus or malware and computer system or network failure there can be no assurance that our business system or those of our third party business partner would not be subject to similar incident including cyber security incident exposing to significant cost reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business data breach and cyber attack could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information and cause significant damage to our business and reputation in the ordinary course of our business we maintain sensitive data on our network including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customer and business partner the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation we believe that company in the technology industry have been increasingly subject to wide variety of security incident cyber attack and other attempt to gain unauthorized access our network and storage application may be subject to unauthorized access by hacker or breached due to operator error malfeasance or other system disruption in some case it is difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incident and the damage caused thereby these data breach and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information cyber attack could also cause to incur significant remediation cost disrupt key business operation and divert attention of management and key information technology resource these incident could also subject to liability expose to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business uncertainty involving the ordering and shipment of our product could materially adversely affect we typically sell our product pursuant to individual purchase order we generally do not have long term supply arrangement with our customer or minimum purchase requirement except that order generally must be for standard pack quantity generally our customer may cancel order for standard product more than day prior to shipment without incurring significant fee we base our inventory level in part on customer estimate of demand for their product which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our product that our customer will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when we sell indirectly through distributor our forecast for demand are then based on estimate provided by multiple party pc and consumer market are characterized by short product lifecycles which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion in addition our customer may change their inventory practice on short notice for any reason we may build inventory during period of anticipated growth and the cancellation or deferral of product order or overproduction due to failure of anticipated order to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory which could result in write down of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margin factor that may result in excess or obsolete inventory which could result in write down of the value of our inventory reduction in the average selling price or reduction in our gross margin include sudden or significant decrease in demand for our product production or design defect in our product table of content higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirement failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our product including for our older product our new product are introduced or our competitor taking aggressive pricing action because market condition are uncertain and because we believe that consumer pc market condition will remain challenging these and other factor could materially adversely affect our business our reliance on third party distributor and add in board aib partner subject to certain risk we market and sell our product directly and through third party distributor and aib partner pursuant to agreement that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party these agreement are non exclusive and permit both our distributor and aibs to offer our competitor product we are dependent on our distributor and aibs to supplement our direct marketing and sale effort if any significant distributor or aib or substantial number of our distributor or aibs terminated their relationship with decided to market our competitor product over our product or decided not to market our product at all our ability to bring our product to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage the risk related to the use of our third party distributor and aib partner or offer the appropriate incentive to focus them on the sale of our product our business could be materially adversely affected additionally distributor and aibs typically maintain an inventory of our product in most instance our agreement with distributor protect their inventory of our product against price reduction well provide return right for any product that we have removed from our price book and that is not more than month older than the manufacturing code date some agreement with our distributor also contain standard stock rotation provision permitting limited level of product return our agreement with aibs protect their inventory of our product against price reduction we defer the gross margin on our sale to distributor and aibs resulting from both our deferral of revenue and related product cost until the applicable product are sold by the distributor or the aibs however in the event of significant decline in the price of our product the price protection right we offer would materially adversely affect because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline acquisition could disrupt our business harm our financial condition and operating result or dilute or adversely affect the price of our common stock our success will depend in part on our ability to expand our product offering and grow our business in response to changing technology customer demand and competitive pressure in some circumstance we may pursue growth through the acquisition of complementary business solution or technology rather than through internal development the identification of suitable acquisition candidate can be difficult time consuming and costly and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisition moreover if such acquisition require to seek additional debt or equity financing we may not be able to obtain such financing on term favorable to or at all even if we successfully complete an acquisition we may not be able to assimilate and integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired business technology solution asset personnel or operation particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for acquisition may also involve the entry into geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience consequently we may not achieve anticipated benefit of the acquisition which could harm our operating result in addition to complete an acquisition we may issue equity security which would dilute our stockholder ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock well incur debt assume contingent liability or have amortization expense and write down of acquired asset which could adversely affect our result of operation acquisition may also reduce our cash available for operation and other us which could harm our business table of content our worldwide operation are subject to political legal and economic risk and natural disaster which could have material adverse effect on we maintain operation around the world including in the united state canada europe and asia we rely on third party wafer foundry in europe and asia nearly all product assembly and final testing of our product is performed at manufacturing facility operated by well third party manufacturing facility in china malaysia and taiwan we also have international sale operation international sale percent of net revenue were in the fourth quarter of and for the year ended we expect that international sale will continue to be significant portion of total sale in the foreseeable future the political legal and economic risk associated with our operation in foreign country include without limitation expropriation change in specific country or region political or economic condition change in tax law trade protection measure and import or export licensing requirement difficulty in protecting our intellectual property difficulty in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practice and labor law change in foreign currency exchange rate restriction on transfer of fund and other asset of our subsidiary between jurisdiction change in freight and interest rate disruption in air transportation between the united state and our overseas facility loss or modification of exemption for tax and tariff and compliance with law and regulation related to international operation including export control and economic sanction law and regulation and the foreign corrupt practice act in addition our worldwide operation or those of our business partner could be subject to natural disaster such earthquake tsunami flooding typhoon and volcanic eruption that disrupt manufacturing or other operation for example our sunnyvale operation are located near major earthquake fault line in california any conflict or uncertainty in the country in which we operate including public health issue for example an outbreak of contagious disease such avian influenza safety issue natural disaster fire disruption of service from utility nuclear power plant accident or general economic or political factor could have material adverse effect on our business any of the risk should they occur could result in an increase in the cost of component production delay general business interruption delay from difficulty in obtaining export license for certain technology tariff and other barrier and restriction longer payment cycle increased tax restriction on the repatriation of fund and the burden of complying with variety of foreign law any of which could ultimately have material adverse effect on our business worldwide political condition may adversely affect demand for our product worldwide political condition may create uncertainty that could adversely affect our business the united state ha been and may continue to be involved in armed conflict that could have further impact on our sale and our supply chain the consequence of armed conflict political instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable and we may not be able to foresee event that could have material adverse effect on terrorist attack or other hostile act may negatively affect our operation or adversely affect demand for our product and such attack or related armed conflict may impact our physical facility or those of our supplier or customer furthermore these attack or hostile act may make travel and the transportation of our product more difficult and more expensive which could materially adversely affect any of these event could cause consumer spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united state economy and worldwide financial market table of content unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuation could adversely affect we have cost asset and liability that are denominated in foreign currency primarily the canadian dollar consequence movement in exchange rate could cause our foreign currency denominated expense to increase percentage of revenue affecting our profitability and cash flow whenever we believe appropriate we hedge portion of our short term foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuation in currency exchange rate we determine our total foreign currency exposure using projection of long term expenditure for item such payroll we can not assure you that these activity will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow in addition the majority of our product sale are denominated in dollar fluctuation in the exchange rate between the dollar and the local currency can cause increase or decrease in the cost of our product in the local currency of such customer an appreciation of the dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sale of our product our inability to effectively control the sale of our product on the gray market could have material adverse effect on we market and sell our product directly to oems and through authorized third party distributor from time to time our product are diverted from our authorized distribution channel and are sold on the gray market gray market product result in shadow inventory that is not visible to thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately also when gray market product enter the market we and our distribution channel compete with these heavily discounted gray market product which adversely affect demand for our product and negatively impact our margin in addition our inability to control gray market activity could result in customer satisfaction issue because any time product are purchased outside our authorized distribution channel there is risk that our customer are buying counterfeit or substandard product including product that may have been altered mishandled or damaged or are used product represented new if we can not adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the united state and abroad through patent copyright trade secret trademark and other measure we may lose competitive advantage and incur significant expense we rely on combination of protection provided by contract including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement copyright patent trademark and common law right such trade secret to protect our intellectual property however we can not assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third party infringement or from misappropriation in the united state and abroad any patent licensed by or issued to could be challenged invalidated or circumvented or right granted there under may not provide competitive advantage to furthermore patent application that we file may not result in issuance of patent or if patent is issued the patent may not be issued in form that is advantageous to despite our effort to protect our intellectual property right others may independently develop similar product duplicate our product or design around our patent and other right in addition it is difficult to monitor compliance with and enforce our intellectual property on worldwide basis in cost effective manner in jurisdiction where foreign law provide le intellectual property protection than afforded in the united state and abroad our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised and our business would be materially adversely affected we are party to litigation and may become party to other claim or litigation that could cause to incur substantial cost or pay substantial damage or prohibit from selling our product from time to time we are defendant or plaintiff in various legal action for example on january complaint wa filed against seeking damage for alleged security law violation which is described in part item legal proceeding below we also sell product to consumer which could increase our exposure to consumer action such product liability claim on occasion we receive claim that individual were allegedly exposed to substance used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facility and that table of content this alleged exposure caused harm litigation can involve complex factual and legal question and it outcome is uncertain any claim that is successfully asserted against including in the january complaint filed against may result in the payment of damage that could be material to our business with respect to intellectual property litigation from time to time we have been notified of or third party may bring or have brought action against and or against our customer based on allegation that we are infringing the intellectual property right of others contributing to or inducing the infringement of the intellectual property right of others or otherwise improperly using the intellectual property of others if any such claim are asserted we may seek to obtain license under the third party intellectual property right we can not assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary license on satisfactory term if at all in the event that we do not obtain license these party may file lawsuit against or our customer seeking damage potentially up to and including treble damage or an injunction against the sale of product that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business presently conducted which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our product or to increase the cost of selling some of our product or which could damage our reputation the award of damage including material royalty payment or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our product could have material adverse effect on we could decide in the alternative to redesign our product or to resort to litigation to challenge such claim such challenge could be extremely expensive and time consuming regardless of their merit could cause delay in product release or shipment and or could have material adverse effect on we can not assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property right or the intellectual property right of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded even if we were to prevail any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operation which could have material adverse effect on variety of environmental law that we are subject to could result in additional cost and liability our operation and property have in the past and continue to be subject to various united state and foreign environmental law and regulation including those relating to material used in our product and manufacturing process discharge of pollutant into the environment the treatment transport storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and remediation of contamination these law and regulation require to obtain permit for our operation including the discharge of air pollutant and wastewater although our management system are designed to maintain compliance we can not assure you that we have been or will be at all time in complete compliance with such law regulation and permit if we violate or fail to comply with any of them range of consequence could result including fine suspension of production alteration of manufacturing process import export restriction sale limitation criminal and civil liability or other sanction we could also be held liable for any and all consequence arising of exposure to hazardous material used stored released disposed of by or located at under or emanating from our facility or other environmental or natural resource damage certain environmental law including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of or the superfund act impose strict or under certain circumstance joint and several liability on current and previous owner or operator of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substance and impose liability for damage to natural resource these law often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or wa not responsible for the release of such hazardous substance these environmental law also ass liability on person who arrange for hazardous substance to be sent to disposal or treatment facility when such facility are found to be contaminated such person can be responsible for cleanup cost even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility we have been named responsible party at three superfund site in sunnyvale california although we have not yet been we could be named potentially responsible party at other superfund or contaminated site in the future in addition contamination that ha not yet been identified could exist at our other facility table of content environmental law are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time for example the eu and china are two among growing number of jurisdiction that have enacted restriction on the use of lead and other material in electronic product these regulation affect semiconductor device and packaging regulation restricting material in electronic product continue to increase around the world there is risk that the cost quality and manufacturing yield of product that are subject to these restriction may be le favorable compared to product that are not subject to such restriction or that the transition to compliant product may produce sudden change in demand which may result in excess inventory recent legislation includes disclosure and reporting requirement for company who use conflict mineral that originate from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining country we will likely incur additional cost associated with complying with these requirement such cost related to determining the source of any conflict mineral used in our product auditing the process and reporting to our customer and the government also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenge if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origin of the subject mineral moreover we are likely to encounter challenge to satisfy those customer who require that all of the component of our product are certified conflict free and if we can not satisfy these customer they may choose competitor product in january intel announced that all of it microprocessor product are conflict free our first conflict mineral report covering the calendar year is due to the sec by june number of jurisdiction including the eu australia and china are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulation for computer and server based on energy star specification well additional energy consumption limit there is the potential for certain of our product being excluded from some of these market which could materially adversely affect while we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditure we can not assure you that future environmental legal requirement will not become more stringent or costly in the future therefore we can not assure you that our cost of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety law and our liability arising from past and future release of or exposure to hazardous substance will not have material adverse effect on our business is subject to potential tax liability we are subject to income tax in the united state canada and other foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax in the ordinary course of our business there are many transaction and calculation where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our tax estimate are reasonable we can not assure you that the final determination of any tax audit and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provision and accrual should additional tax be assessed result of an audit or litigation there could be material adverse effect on our cash income tax provision and net income in the period or period for which that determination is made item unresolved staff comment none item property at december we owned principal research and development engineering manufacturing warehouse and administrative facility located in canada china and malaysia these facility totaled approximately square foot table of content we lease our main facility with respect to our graphic and visual solution and chipset product which is located in markham ontario canada this facility consists of approximately square foot of office and research and development space we own and operate one additional facility in markham ontario which consists of approximately square foot including office space and approximately square foot of warehouse space we also currently own and operate two facility in malaysia and china comprising an aggregate of approximately square foot including office space and approximately square foot of assembly test mark and packaging facility which are described in further detail in the section entitled assembly test mark and packaging facility above in some case we lease all or portion of the land on which our facility are located we lease approximately square foot of land in suzhou china for our assembly test mark and packaging facility of december we also leased approximately million square foot of space for engineering manufacturing warehouse and administrative use including our headquarters in sunnyvale california our principal administrative facility in austin texas and number of smaller regional sale office located in commercial center near customer principally in the united state latin america europe and asia these lease expire at varying date through although some of these lease include optional renewal the lease for our headquarters in sunnyvale california expires in december and provides for two successive year optional renewal the lease for our principal administrative facility in austin texas expires in march and provides for one year optional renewal we also have approximately square foot of building space that is currently vacant we continue to have lease obligation with respect to this space that expire at various date through we are actively marketing this space for sublease we currently do not anticipate difficulty in either retaining occupancy of any of our facility through lease renewal prior to expiration or through month to month occupancy or replacing them with equivalent facility we believe that our existing facility are suitable and adequate for our present purpose and that except discussed above the productive capacity of such facility is substantially being utilized or we have plan to utilize it item legal proceeding security class action on january class action lawsuit captioned hatamian amd et al no cv wa filed against in the united state district court for the northern district of california the complaint purport to assert claim against amd and certain individual officer for alleged violation of section of the security exchange act of amended the exchange act and rule of the exchange act the plaintiff seek to represent proposed class of all person who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock during the period october through october the complaint seek damage allegedly caused by alleged materially misleading statement and or material omission by and the individual officer regarding our technology and llano product which statement and omission the plaintiff claim allegedly operated to inflate artificially the price paid for our common stock during the period the complaint seek unspecified compensatory damage attorney fee and cost based upon information presently known to management we believe that the potential liability if any will not have material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flow or result of operation environmental matter we are named responsible party on superfund clean up order for three site in sunnyvale california that are on the national priority list since we have discovered hazardous material release to the groundwater from former underground tank and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three site the chemical released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the united state in the wafer fabrication process prior to table of content in we received final site clean up requirement order from the california regional water quality control board relating to the three site we have entered into settlement agreement with other responsible party on two of the order during the term of such agreement other party have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable cost well the primary role in conducting remediation activity under the order we remain responsible for additional cost beyond the scope of the agreement well all remaining cost in the event that the other party do not fulfill their obligation under the settlement agreement to address anticipated future remediation cost under the order we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately million and have not recorded any potential insurance recovery in determining the estimated cost of the cleanup cost could also increase result of additional test and remediation obligation imposed by the environmental protection agency or california regional water quality control board the progress of future remediation effort can not be predicted with certainty and these cost may change we believe that the potential liability if any in excess of amount already accrued will not have material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flow or result of operation other matter we are defendant or plaintiff in various action that arose in the normal course of business with respect to these matter based on our current knowledge we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss if any will not either individually or in the aggregate have material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flow or result of operation item

investment company llc atic and west coast hitech wch pursuant to which we formed gf in connection with the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the master transaction agreement amd atic and gf entered into wafer supply agreement the wsa funding agreement the funding agreement and shareholder agreement the shareholder agreement on march at gf formation on march and through december gf wa deemed variable interest entity and we were deemed to be gf primary beneficiary accordingly we consolidated gf under applicable accounting rule result of certain gf governance change we deconsolidated gf and accounted for our gf ownership under the equity method of accounting of december following the deconsolidation gf became our related party in the first quarter of result of contribution to gf by an affiliate of atic and certain gf governance change noted above our ownership in gf wa diluted and we concluded that we no longer had the ability to exercise significant influence over gf accordingly we changed our accounting for our investment in gf from the equity method to the cost method of accounting and recognized dilution gain in investee of approximately million in the fourth quarter of we identified indicator of impairment in gf that were deemed other than temporary we performed valuation analysis and recorded non cash impairment charge of million the carrying value of our remaining investment in gf after the impairment charge wa million of december on march partial consideration for certain right received under second amendment to the wsa we transferred to gf all of the remaining capital stock of gf that we owned in addition of march the funding agreement wa terminated and we were no longer party to the shareholder agreement result of these transaction we no longer owned any gf capital stock of march gf continues to be related party of because mubadala development company pjsc mubadala and atic are affiliated with wch our largest stockholder wch and atic are wholly owned subsidiary of mubadala wafer supply agreement the wsa governs the term by which we purchase product manufactured by gf pursuant to the wsa we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and apu product requirement from gf with limited exception if we acquire third party business that manufacture microprocessor and apu product we will have up to two year to transition the manufacture of such microprocessor and apu product to gf table of content the wsa terminates no later than march gf ha agreed to use commercially reasonable effort to assist to transition the supply of product to another provider and to continue to fulfill purchase order for up to two year following the termination or expiration of the wsa during the transition period pricing for microprocessor and apu product will remain set forth in the wsa but our purchase commitment to gf will no longer apply on april we entered into first amendment to the wsa the primary effect of the first amendment wa to change the pricing methodology applicable to wafer delivered in for our microprocessor and apu product the first amendment also modified our existing commitment regarding the production of certain gpu and chipset product at gf on march we entered into second amendment to the wsa the primary effect of the second amendment wa to modify certain pricing and other term of the wsa applicable to wafer for our microprocessor and apu product to be delivered by gf to during under the term of the second amendment to the wsa gf granted right to contract with another wafer foundry supplier with respect to specified product for specified period of time the limited waiver of exclusivity in consideration for the limited waiver of exclusivity we recorded charge of million in the first quarter of consisting of million cash payment and million non cash charge representing the transfer to gf of our remaining investment in gf at fair value on december we entered into third amendment to the wsa pursuant to the third amendment we modified our wafer purchase commitment for the fourth quarter of made pursuant to the second amendment to the wsa in addition we agreed to certain pricing and other term of the wsa applicable to wafer for our microprocessor and apu product to be delivered by gf to from the fourth quarter of through december pursuant to the third amendment gf agreed to waive portion of our wafer purchase commitment for the fourth quarter of in consideration for this waiver we agreed to pay gf fee of million result we recorded lower of cost or market charge of million for the write down of inventory to it market value in the fourth quarter of the cash impact of this million fee wa paid over several quarter with million paid on december million paid on april and million paid on december we are currently in the process of negotiating fourth amendment to the wsa and we expect that our future purchase from gf will continue to be material our expense related to gf wafer manufacturing were million billion and million in and respectively our expense related to gf research and development activity were million million and million for and respectively critical accounting estimate our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of our financial statement requires to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount in our consolidated financial statement we evaluate our estimate on an on going basis including those related to our revenue inventory goodwill impairment and income tax we base our estimate on historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability although actual result have historically been reasonably consistent with management expectation the actual result may differ from these estimate or our estimate may be affected by different assumption or condition management belief the following critical accounting estimate are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statement and require the most difficult subjective and complex judgment table of content revenue allowance we record provision for estimated sale return and allowance on product sale for estimated future price reduction and other customer incentive in the same period that the related revenue are recorded we base these estimate on actual historical sale return allowance historical price reduction market activity and other known or anticipated trend and factor these estimate are subject to management judgment and actual provision could be different from our estimate and current provision resulting in future adjustment to our revenue and operating result inventory valuation at each balance sheet date we evaluate our ending inventory for excess quantity and obsolescence this evaluation includes analysis of sale level by product and projection of future demand these projection assist in determining the carrying value of our inventory in addition we write off inventory that are considered obsolete we adjust the remaining specific inventory balance to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value among other factor management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand competitiveness of product offering market condition and product life cycle when determining obsolescence and market value if in any period we anticipate future demand or market condition to be le favorable than our previous estimate additional inventory write down may be required and would be reflected in cost of sale in the period the revision is made this would have negative impact on our gross margin in that period if in any period we are able to sell inventory that were not valued or that had been written off in previous period related revenue would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sale resulting in net benefit to our gross margin in that period goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible asset acquired goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there are indicator of impairment present we perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year we evaluate whether goodwill ha been impaired at the reporting unit level by first determining whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is le than it carrying value and if so by determining whether the implied fair value of goodwill within the reporting unit is le than the carrying value the implied fair value of reporting unit is determined through the application of one or more valuation model common to our industry including the income market and cost approach while market valuation data for comparable company is gathered and analyzed we believe that there ha not been sufficient comparability between the peer group and the specific reporting unit to allow for the derivation of reliable indication of value using market approach therefore we have ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimate of future operating result and cash flow of each of the reporting unit discounted using estimated discount rate the key assumption we have used to determine the fair value of our reporting unit includes projected cash flow for the next year and discount rate ranging from in to in discount rate are based on our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risk associated with operation variance in the discount rate could have significant impact on the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded if any based on the result of our annual analysis of goodwill in and each reporting unit fair value exceeded it carrying value indicating that there wa no goodwill impairment for the annual goodwill impairment analysis in each reporting unit estimated fair value exceeded it carrying value ranging from approximately to approximately the computing solution reporting unit had the lowest excess of fair value over carrying value at due to the decline in the pc market and increased competition in estimating the fair value of our reporting unit we took into consideration the challenging industry and market trend that existed of september the date of the annual goodwill impairment test for each respective reporting unit estimate of fair value for all of our reporting unit can be affected by variety of external and internal factor potential event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumption we used in estimating the fair value of our computing solution reporting unit include adverse table of content change in our industry increased competition an inability to successfully introduce new product in the marketplace or to achieve internal forecast and decline in our stock price if the estimated fair value of our computing solution reporting unit decline due to any of these factor we may be required to record future goodwill impairment charge income tax in determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purpose we must make certain estimate and judgment these estimate and judgment are applied in the calculation of certain tax liability and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax asset which arise from temporary difference between the recognition of asset and liability for tax and financial statement reporting purpose we must ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset if recovery is not likely we must increase our charge to income tax expense in the form of valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we consider past performance future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategy in determining the need for valuation allowance in addition the calculation of our tax liability involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax rule and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax position by the internal revenue service or other taxing authority if our estimate of these tax are greater or le than actual result an additional tax benefit or charge will result we recognize potential accrued interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit interest expense and income tax expense result of operation management including the chief operating decision maker who is our chief executive officer review and ass our operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income loss before interest other income expense net and income tax these performance measure include the allocation of expense to the operating segment based on management judgment we use the following two reportable segment the computing solution segment comprised of microprocessor standalone device or incorporated an apu chipsets embedded processor and dense server and the graphic and visual solution segment comprised of gpus including professional graphic semi custom soc product revenue from development service and royalty for game console in addition to these reportable segment we have an all other category which is not reportable segment this category includes certain expense and credit that were not allocated to any of the operating segment because management doe not consider these expense and credit in evaluating the performance of the operating segment also included in this category are amortization of acquired intangible asset employee stock based compensation expense restructuring and other special charge net charge related to the limited waiver of exclusivity from gf and net gain from license and settlement agreement regarding patent related matter we also reported the result of former
