remeasurement of these non currency into dollar we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our asset and liability denominated in currency other than the functional currency of our subsidiary while we regularly enter into transaction to hedge foreign currency exchange risk for portion of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure it is impossible to predict or entirely eliminate the effect of this exposure any factor that reduce cross border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business cross border trade transaction where the merchant and consumer are in different country is an important source of our revenue and profit cross border transaction generally provide higher revenue and operating income than similar transaction that take place within single country or market cross border trade also represents our primary and in some case our only presence in certain important market cross border trade is subject to and may be negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation in addition the interpretation and application of law of multiple jurisdiction the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer are often extremely complicated in the context of cross border trade and foreign exchange change to or the interpretation and or application of law and regulation applicable to cross border trade and foreign exchange could impose additional requirement and restriction increase cost and impose conflicting obligation any factor that increase the cost of cross border trade for or our customer or that restrict delay

increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment card or in fee associated with our funding mix or other event or development that make it more difficult or costly for to fund transaction with lower cost funding option could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business we have entered into strategic partnership with major payment card network and or issuing bank to promote greater consumer choice and make it easier for merchant to accept and consumer to pay with these partner credit card and or debit card and to allow to gain access to these partner tokenization service for in store point of sale paypal transaction these arrangement may have an uncertain impact on our business while we anticipate that these and similar strategic partnership we may enter into in the future will result in an increase in the number of transaction and transaction volume that we process we also anticipate that greater percentage of customer transaction will be executed using payment card which would likely increase the transaction cost associated with our funding mix which could adversely affect our business result of operation and profitability the united kingdom departure from the eu could adversely affect the united kingdom held referendum in june in which majority of voter approved an exit from the european union eu commonly referred to brexit the formally exited the eu on january and transition period is in place until december during which time the will remain in both the eu custom union and single market and follow eu rule there is significant lack of clarity over the term of the future relationship with the eu after this date brexit could therefore adversely affect regional including european and worldwide economic and market condition and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign currency exchange market including volatility in the value of the british pound and euro which in turn could adversely affect or our customer and company with which we do business particularly in the brexit could lead to greater restriction on the supply and availability of good and service between the and the eea region with the potential inability of company to fulfill order which could lead to risk of increased merchant default and buyer protection claim brexit could also trigger general deterioration in credit condition downturn in consumer sentiment and overall negative economic growth any of these scenario could have an adverse effect on our business or our customer in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and increased complexity for financial service firm national law and regulation in the start to diverge from eu law and regulation in particular depending on the term of brexit we may face new regulatory cost and challenge including the following if we are unable to utilize appropriate authorization and regulatory permission our european operation could lose their ability to offer service into the market on cross border basis and for our based operation to offer service on cross border basis in the european market for example our ability to work primarily with the luxembourg regulator the lead authority for various aspect of the operation of paypal europe et cie sca paypal europe and with the swedish regulator for various aspect of the operation of izettle ab izettle may be impacted we could be required to obtain additional regulatory permission to operate in the market adding cost and potential inconsistency to our business depending on the capacity of the authority the criterion for obtaining permission and any possible transitional arrangement our business in the could be materially affected or disrupted we could be required to comply with legal and regulatory requirement in the that are in addition to or inconsistent with those of the eu leading to increased complexity and cost for our european and

reputation damage our brand and business and adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition the complexity of federal and state and international regulatory and enforcement regime coupled with the global scope of our operation and the evolving global regulatory environment could result in single event prompting large number of overlapping investigation and legal and regulatory

requires to make estimate and assumption about certain item and future event that directly affect our reported financial condition we have established detailed policy and control procedure to provide reasonable assurance that the method used to make estimate and assumption are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the accounting estimate and assumption discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statement an accounting estimate is considered critical if both the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved and the impact within reasonable range of outcome of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition senior management ha discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimate with the audit risk and compliance committee of our board of director our significant accounting policy including recent accounting pronouncement are described in note overview and summary of significant accounting policy to the consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investor the amount used to ass sensitivity are included to allow user of this report to understand general directional cause and effect of change in the estimate and do not represent management prediction of variability for all of these estimate it should be noted that future event rarely develop exactly forecasted and estimate require regular review and adjustment transaction and loan lossestransaction and loan loss include the expense associated with our customer protection program fraud chargebacks and credit loss associated with our loan receivable balance our transaction and loan loss fluctuate depending on many factor including total tpv macroeconomic condition change to our customer protection program the impact of regulatory change and the credit quality of loan receivable arising from transaction funded with our credit product which include our paypal credit consumer product and merchant loan and advance arising from our paypal working capital ppwc and paypal business loan ppbl product of contentswe establish allowance for estimated transaction loss arising from processing customer transaction such chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchant related chargebacks due to non delivery of good or service ach return buyer protection program claim account takeover and account overdraft addition to the allowance in the form of provision are reflected in transaction and loan loss on our consolidated statement of income the allowance are monitored regularly and are updated based on actual claim data the allowance are based on known fact and circumstance internal factor including experience with similar case historical trend involving loss payment pattern and the mix of transaction and loss type we also establish an allowance for loan receivable which represents our estimate of probable incurred loan loss inherent in our merchant loan and advance and consumer loan receivable increase to the allowance for loan receivable are reflected transaction and loan loss on our consolidated financial statement this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimate and judgment for our consumer loan receivables consisting primarily of our international consumer receivables the allowance is primarily based on forecasted principal balance delinquency rate roll rate roll rate are the percentage of balance which we estimate will migrate from one stage of delinquency to the next based on our historical experience well external factor such estimated bankruptcy and level of unemployment roll rate are applied to the principal amount of our consumer loan receivables for each stage of delinquency from current to day past the payment due date to estimate the principal loan which have incurred loss and are probable to be charged off for merchant loan and advance the allowance is primarily based on principal balance forecasted delinquency rate and recovery through the use of vintage based loss forecasting model the allowance for loss against the interest receivable is determined primarily by applying historical average customer account roll rate to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to project the value of account that have incurred loss and are probable to be charged off the allowance for fee receivable is primarily based on fee balance forecasted delinquency rate and recovery through the use of vintage based loss forecasting model increase to the allowance for interest receivable are reflected reduction of net revenue on our consolidated statement of income increase to the allowance for fee receivable are recognized reduction in deferred revenue included in other current liability on our consolidated balance sheet determining appropriate allowance for these loss is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate loss may vary from the current estimate we regularly update our allowance estimate new fact become known and event occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of loss the allowance are maintained at level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for loss incurred at the balance sheet date based on our result for the year ended december an aggregate ten percent increase in our transaction and loan loss rate would negatively impact transaction and loan loss by approximately million accounting for income tax our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rate and tax planning opportunity available to in the various jurisdiction in which we operate tax law are complex and subject to different interpretation by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authority significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax position including evaluating uncertainty we review our tax position quarterly and adjust the balance new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate that apply to our foreign earnings in addition to local country tax law and regulation our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the through new provision under the tax act such the gilti tax and base erosion anti abuse tax or result of our indefinite reinvestment assertion indefinite reinvestment is determined by management judgment about and intention concerning our future operation deferred tax asset represent amount available to reduce income tax payable on taxable income in future year such asset arise because of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability well from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deduction and credit by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategy these source of income rely heavily on estimate that are based on number of factor including our historical experience and short range and long range business forecast to the extent deferred tax asset are not expected to be realized we record valuation allowance we recognize and measure uncertain tax position in accordance with gaap pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement from such position are measured based on the largest benefit that ha greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we report liability for unrecognized tax benefit resulting from uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return gaap further requires that change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax position be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs we recognize interest and penalty if any related to unrecognized tax benefit in income tax expense of contentswe file annual income tax return in multiple taxing jurisdiction around the world number of year may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authority and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our reserve for income tax are adequate such that we reflect the benefit more likely than not to be sustained in an examination we adjust these reserve well the related interest and penalty where appropriate in light of changing fact and circumstance settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash based on our result for the year ended december one percentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately million loss contingencieswe are currently involved in various claim regulatory and legal proceeding and investigation of potential operating violation by regulatory oversight authority we regularly review the status of each significant matter and ass our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim legal proceeding or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we accrue liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgment are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceeding the merit of our defense and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel because of uncertainty related to these matter accrual are based only on the best information available at the time additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claim litigation or other violation and may revise our estimate due to the inherent uncertainty of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdiction in which we operate our judgment may be materially different than the actual outcome revenue recognitionapplication of the accounting principle in gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires to make judgment and estimate complex arrangement with nonstandard term and condition may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting specifically the determination of whether we are principal to transaction gross revenue or an agent net revenue can require considerable judgment further we provide incentive payment to consumer and merchant which require judgment to determine whether the payment should be recorded reduction to gross revenue change in judgment with respect to these assumption and estimate could impact the amount of revenue recognized valuation of goodwill and intangiblesthe valuation of asset acquired in business combination and asset impairment review require the use of significant estimate and assumption the acquisition method of accounting for business combination requires to estimate the fair value of asset acquired liability assumed and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired business to properly allocate purchase price consideration between asset that are depreciated and amortized and goodwill impairment testing for asset other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset requires the allocation of cash flow to those asset or group of asset and if required an estimate of fair value for the asset or group of asset our estimate are based upon assumption that we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable these valuation require the use of management assumption which do not reflect unanticipated event and circumstance that may occur we evaluate goodwill and intangible asset for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicator of impairment exist under gaap the evaluation of indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment allows for qualitative assessment to be performed which is similar to the gaap for evaluating goodwill for impairment in performing these qualitative assessment we consider relevant event and condition including but not limited to macroeconomic trend industry and market condition overall financial performance cost factor company specific event legal and regulatory factor and our market capitalization if the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset are le than their carrying amount we must perform quantitative impairment test under the quantitative impairment test if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds the fair value of the respective reporting unit goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset an impairment loss is recorded in the statement of income measurement of the fair value of reporting unit is based on one or more of the following fair value measure amount at which the unit whole could be bought or sold in current transaction between willing party present value technique of estimated future cash flow valuation technique based on multiple of earnings or revenue or similar performance measure of contentsitem

customer balance we do not pay interest on amount due to customer we have billion in fixed rate debt with varying maturity date since these note bear interest at fixed rate they do not result in any financial statement risk associated with change in interest rate however the fair value of these note fluctuates when interest rate change we also have various committed credit facility available to aggregating to approximately billion we are obligated to pay interest on loan under these facility well other customary fee including an upfront fee and an unused commitment fee based on our debt rating borrowing under these facility if any bear interest at floating rate result we are exposed to the risk related to fluctuation in interest rate to the extent of our borrowing of december we had no amount outstanding under these credit facility of december we had billion of borrowing outstanding at weighted average interest rate of for additional information see note debt in the note to the consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form kinterest rate may also adversely impact our customer spending level and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amount owed to higher interest rate often lead to higher payment obligation by customer of our credit product to or to lender under mortgage credit card and other consumer and merchant loan which may reduce our customer ability to remain current on their obligation to and therefore lead to increased delinquency charge offs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income basis point increase in interest rate would not have had material impact on our financial asset or liability at december and foreign currency exchange rate riskwe have significant operation internationally that are denominated in foreign currency primarily the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting to foreign currency exchange rate risk which may adversely impact our financial result we transact business in various foreign currency and have significant international revenue and cost in addition we charge our international subsidiary for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate service our cash flow result of operation and certain of our intercompany balance that are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation may differ materially from expectation and we may record significant gain or loss due to foreign currency fluctuation and related hedging activity we are generally net receiver of foreign currency and therefore benefit from weakening of the dollar and are adversely affected by strengthening of the dollar relative to foreign currency we have foreign currency exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposure manage these exposure and reduce the potential effect of currency fluctuation on our reported consolidated cash flow and result of operation through the execution of foreign currency exchange contract these foreign currency exchange contract are accounted for derivative instrument for additional detail related to our foreign currency exchange contract please see note derivative instrument to the consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form of contentswe use foreign currency exchange forward contract to protect our forecasted dollar equivalent earnings and our investment in foreign subsidiary from adverse change in foreign currency exchange rate these hedging contract reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement we designate these contract cash flow and net investment hedge for accounting purpose the derivative gain or loss is initially reported component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci cash flow hedge are subsequently reclassified into the financial statement line item in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the forecasted transaction affect earnings the accumulated gain and loss associated with the net investment hedge will remain in aoci until the foreign subsidiary is sold or substantially liquidated at which point they will be reclassified into earnings we considered the historical trend in foreign currency exchange rate and determined that it wa reasonably possible that change in exchange rate of for all currency could be experienced in the near term if the dollar weakened by at december and the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign currency exchange forward contract before tax would have been approximately million and million lower respectively if the dollar strengthened by at december and the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign currency exchange forward contract before tax would have been approximately million and million higher respectively we have an additional foreign currency exchange management program whereby we use foreign currency exchange contract to offset the foreign currency exchange risk on our asset and liability denominated in currency other than the functional currency of our subsidiary these contract are not designated hedging instrument and reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movement on our asset and liability the foreign currency exchange gain and loss on our asset and liability are recorded in other income expense net and are offset by the gain and loss on the foreign currency exchange contract adverse change in exchange rate of for all currency would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income tax of approximately million and million at december and respectively without considering the offsetting effect of hedging foreign currency exchange contract in place of december would have positively impacted income before income tax by approximately million resulting in net positive impact of approximately million foreign currency exchange contract in place of december would have positively impacted income before income tax by approximately million resulting in net positive impact of approximately million these reasonably possible adverse change in exchange rate of were applied to total monetary asset and liability denominated in currency other than the functional currency of our subsidiary at the balance sheet date to compute the adverse impact these change would have had on our income before income tax in the near term equity investment riskour strategic investment are subject to variety of market related risk that could substantially reduce or increase the carrying value of the portfolio of december and our strategic investment totaled billion and million respectively which represented approximately and of our total cash cash equivalent and investment portfolio at those respective date our strategic investment include marketable equity security which are publicly traded and non marketable equity security which are investment in privately held company that are not publicly traded we are required to record all adjustment to the carrying value of these strategic investment through our consolidated statement of income such we anticipate volatility to our net income in future period due to change in fair value related to our investment in marketable equity security and change in observable price related to our non marketable equity security accounted for under the measurement alternative these change could be material based on market condition hypothetical adverse change in the carrying value of our strategic investment of which could be experienced in the near term would result in decrease of approximately million to the carrying value of the portfolio we review our non marketable equity investment accounted for under the measurement alternative for impairment when event and circumstance indicate decline in fair value of such asset below carrying value

receivables are reflected component of transaction and loan loss on our consolidated financial statement the evaluation process to ass the adequacy of allowance is subject to numerous estimate and principle judgment for our consumer loan receivable the allowance is primarily based on forecasted principal balance delinquency rate roll rate roll rate are the percentage of balance which we estimate will migrate from one stage of delinquency to the next based on our historical experience well external factor such estimated bankruptcy and level of unemployment roll rate are applied to the principal amount of our consumer receivables for each stage of delinquency from current to day past the payment due date in order to estimate the principal loan which have incurred loss and are probable to be charged off we charge off consumer loan receivable balance in the month in which customer balance becomes day past the payment due date in connection with our agreement to sell our consumer credit receivables to synchrony and the designation of that portfolio held for sale in november we reversed the corresponding allowance against those loan and interest receivable balance such

primarily driven by charge offs were recorded in restructuring and other charge in our consolidated statement of income of contentspaypal holding inc note to consolidated financial statement continued for merchant loan and advance receivable the allowance is primarily based on principal balance forecasted delinquency rate and recovery through the use of vintage based loss forecasting model the determination of delinquency from current to day past due for principal balance related to merchant receivables outstanding is based on the current expected or contractual repayment period of the loan or advance and interest or fixed fee compared to the original expected or contractual repayment period for our ppwc product there is general requirement that at least of the original amount of the loan or advance plus the fixed fee must be repaid every day we calculate the repayment rate of the merchant future payment volume so that repayment of the loan or advance and fixed fee is expected to generally occur within to month from the date of the loan or advance on monthly basis we recalculate the repayment period based on the repayment activity on the receivable such actual repayment period are dependent on actual merchant payment processing volume for our ppbl product we receive fixed periodic payment over the contractual term of the loan which generally range from to month we actively monitor receivables with repayment period greater than the original expected or contractual repayment period the allowance for loss against interest receivable is primarily determined by applying historical average customer account roll rate to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to project the value of account that have incurred loss and are probable to be charged off the allowance for fee receivable is primarily based on fee balance forecasted delinquency rate and recovery through the use of vintage based loss forecasting model increase to the allowance for interest receivable are reflected reduction of net revenue in our consolidated statement of income increase to the allowance for fee receivable are recognized reduction of deferred revenue included in other current liability in our consolidated balance sheet we charge off the receivables under our ppwc product when the repayment are day past our expectation of repayment and the merchant ha not made

compared to the incurred loss framework applied today the largest driver of this increase are the change to lifetime reserve framework at the time the asset is initially recorded and the inclusion of macro economic factor within the model although the timing of the recognition of loss may result in an increase in loan loss in given period this increased allowance is not expected to result in change in our economic loss at adoption expected credit loss reserve related to our other financing receivables available for sale debt security and other financial instrument will not have material impact on our consolidated financial statement the extent of the actual impact of the adoption of this guidance at the effective date will depend on the amount and asset quality of our financial instrument current and forecasted economic condition at the time of adoption and any further refinement made to our model in the fasb issued amended guidance for simplifying certain aspect for the accounting for income tax this amended guidance is intended to remove certain exception to the general principle in current gaap reduce the cost and complexity in accounting for income tax and improve

these fee may have fixed and variable component the variable component is generally percentage of the value of the payment amount and is known at the time the transaction is processed for portion of our transaction the variable component of the fee is eligible for reimbursement when the underlying transaction is approved for refund we estimate the amount of fee refund that will be processed during the quarter and record provision against our net revenue the volume of activity processed on our payment platform which result in transaction revenue is referred to total payment volume tpv we define tpv the value of payment net of reversal successfully completed on our payment platform or enabled by paypal via partner payment solution not including gateway exclusive transaction we earn

provided our contract generally renew automatically without significant material right some of our contract include tiered pricing based primarily on volume the fee charged per transaction is adjusted up or down if the volume processed for specified period is different from prior period defined volume we have concluded that this volume based pricing approach doe not constitute future material right

are designated cash flow hedge and accordingly the derivative gain or loss is initially reported component of aoci and subsequently reclassified into revenue in the same period the forecasted transaction affect earnings we evaluate the effectiveness of our foreign currency exchange contract on quarterly basis by comparing the critical term of the derivative instrument with the critical term of the forecasted cash flow of the hedged item if the critical term are the same we conclude the hedge will be perfectly effective we did not exclude any component of the change in fair value of the derivative instrument from the assessment of hedge effectiveness we report cash flow arising from derivative instrument consistent with the classification of cash flow from the underlying hedged item that these derivative are hedging accordingly the cash flow associated with derivative designated cash flow hedge are classified in cash flow from operating activity on our consolidated statement

earnings prior to the occurrence of the hedged transaction if we elect to discontinue our cash flow hedge and it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will occur we continue to report the derivative gain or loss in aoci until the forecasted transaction affect earnings at which point we also reclassify it into earnings gain and loss on derivative held after we discontinue our cash
