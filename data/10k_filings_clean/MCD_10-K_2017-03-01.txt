have limited supplier which may increase our reliance on those supplier supply chain interruption including shortage and transportation issue and price increase can adversely affect well our supplier and franchisees whose performance may have significant impact on our result such shortage or disruption could be caused by factor beyond the control of our supplier franchisees or if we experience

of risk our success increasingly relies on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees yet we have limited influence over their operation our restaurant margin arise from two source fee from franchised restaurant rent and royalty based on percentage of sale and to lesser degree sale from company operated restaurant our franchisees manage their business independently and therefore are responsible for the day to day operation of their restaurant the revenue we realize from franchised restaurant are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sale if our franchisees do not experience sale growth our revenue and margin could be negatively affected result also if sale trend worsen for franchisees their financial result may deteriorate which could result in among other thing restaurant closure or delayed or reduced payment to our refranchising effort will increase that dependence and the effect of those factor our success also increasingly depends on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees to implement major initiative which may include financial investment and to remain aligned with on operating promotional and capital intensive reinvestment plan franchisees ability to contribute to the achievement of our plan is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rate and may be

factor whose interrelationship is complex and changing our ability to achieve the benefit of our refranchising strategy which involves shift to greater percentage of franchised restaurant in timely manner or at all will depend on various factor including our ability to timely and effectively select franchisees and or licensee that meet our rigorous standard and or to complete transaction on favorable term and to manage associated risk it will also depend on the performance of our franchisees and whether the resulting ownership mix support our financial objective challenge with respect to talent management could harm our business effective succession planning is important to our long term success failure effectively to identify develop and retain key personnel recruit high quality candidate and ensure smooth management and personnel transition could disrupt our business and adversely affect our result our success depends in part on our system ability to recruit motivate and

company operated restaurant could have negative impact on our company operated margin similar concern apply to our franchisees we are also impacted by the cost and other effect of compliance with and international regulation affecting our workforce which includes our staff and employee working in our company operated restaurant these regulation are increasingly focused on employment issue including wage and hour healthcare immigration retirement and other employee benefit and workplace practice our potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practice or condition or those of our independent franchisees or supplier or perception thereof could have negative impact on consumer perception of and our business additionally economic action such boycott protest work stoppage or campaign by labor organization could adversely affect including our ability to recruit and retain talent or the franchisees and supplier that are also part of the mcdonald system and whose performance may have material impact on our result change in commodity and other operating cost could adversely affect our result of operation the profitability of our company operated restaurant depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to change in commodity cost including food paper supply fuel utility distribution and other operating cost any volatility in certain commodity price could adversely affect our operating result by impacting restaurant profitability the commodity market for some of the ingredient we use such beef and chicken are particularly volatile due to factor such seasonal shift climate condition industry demand international commodity market food safety concern product recall and government regulation all of which are beyond our control and in many instance unpredictable we can only partially address future price risk through hedging and other activity and therefore increase in commodity cost could have an adverse impact on our profitability the global scope of our business subject to risk that could negatively affect our business we encounter differing cultural regulatory and economic environment within and among the more than country where mcdonald restaurant operate and our ability to achieve our business objective depends on the system success in these environment meeting customer expectation is complicated by the risk inherent in our global operating environment and our global success is partially dependent on our system ability to leverage operating success across market planned initiative may not have appeal across multiple market with mcdonald customer and could drive unanticipated change in customer perception and guest count disruption in operation or price volatility in market can also result from governmental action such price mcdonald corporation annual report exchange or change in trade related tariff or control government mandated closure of our our franchisees or our supplier operation and asset seizure the cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigation or inquiry whether or not they have merit may impact our result and could cause reputational or other harm our international success depends in part on the effectiveness of our strategy and brand building initiative to reduce our exposure to such governmental investigation or inquiry additionally challenge and uncertainty are associated with operating in developing market which may entail relatively higher risk of political instability economic volatility crime corruption and social and ethnic unrest such challenge may be exacerbated in many case by lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainty in local law is applied and enforced including in area most relevant to commercial transaction and foreign investment an inability to manage effectively the risk associated with our international operation could have material adverse effect on our business and financial condition we may also face challenge and uncertainty in developed market for example result of the decision to leave the european union through negotiated exit over period of time it is possible that there will be increased regulatory complexity well potential referendum in the and or other european country that could cause uncertainty in european or worldwide economic condition in the short term the decision created volatility in certain foreign currency exchange rate and the resulting depression in those exchange rate may continue any of these effect and others we can not anticipate could adversely affect our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow change in tax law and unanticipated tax liability could adversely affect the tax we pay and our profitability we are

or elsewhere we are also impacted by settlement of pending or any future adjustment proposed by taxing authority outside of the or the irs in connection with our tax audit all of which will depend on their timing nature and scope any increase in income tax rate change in income tax law or unfavorable resolution of tax matter could have material adverse impact on our financial result information technology system failure or interruption or breach of network security may interrupt our operation we are increasingly reliant on technological system such point of sale and other in store system or platform well technology that facilitate communication and collaboration internally with affiliated entity or with independent third party to conduct our business including technology enabled solution provided to by third party any failure of these system could significantly impact our operation and customer perception despite the implementation of security measure those technology system and solution could become vulnerable to damage disability or failure due to theft fire power loss telecommunication failure or other catastrophic event the third party solution also present the risk faced by the third party business if those system or solution were to fail or otherwise be unavailable and we were unable to recover in timely way we could experience an interruption in our operation furthermore security breach involving our system the system of the party we communicate or collaborate with or those of third party provider may occur such unauthorized access denial of service

financial proprietary and other confidential information related to our business an actual or alleged security breach could result in system disruption shutdown theft or unauthorized disclosure of

increasing regulatory complexity may adversely affect restaurant operation and our financial result our regulatory environment worldwide expose to complex compliance and similar risk that could affect our operation and result in material way in many of our market we are subject to increasing regulation which ha increased our cost of business we are affected by the cost compliance and other risk associated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulation we face including where inconsistent standard imposed by multiple governmental authority can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigation or proceeding our success depends in part on our ability to manage the impact of new potential or changing regulation that can affect our business plan and operation these regulation include product packaging marketing the nutritional content and safety of our food and other product labeling and other disclosure practice and compliance effort may be affected by ordinary variation in food preparation among our own restaurant and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third party supplier particularly given varying requirement and practice for testing and disclosure additionally we are working to manage the risk and cost to our franchisees and our supply chain of the effect of climate change greenhouse gas and diminishing energy and water resource these risk include the increased public focus including by governmental and nongovernmental organization on these and other environmental sustainability matter such packaging and waste animal health and welfare deforestation and land use these risk also include the increased pressure to make commitment set target or

arising from contract with customer the standard will be effective for the company beginning january with early adoption permitted the standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized of the date of adoption modified retrospective method the company currently expects to apply the modified retrospective transition method upon adoption the company doe not believe the standard will impact it recognition of revenue from company operated restaurant or it recognition of royalty from restaurant operated by franchisees or licensed to affiliate and developmental licensee which are based on percent of sale while we continue to ass the potential impact to other le significant revenue transaction we currently believe the standard will change the way initial fee from franchisees for new restaurant opening or new franchise term are recognized noted above the company current accounting policy is to recognize initial franchise fee when earned per the contract term which is currently when new store open or at the start of new franchise term in accordance with the new guidance the initial franchise service are not distinct from the continuing right or service offered during the term of the franchise agreement and will therefore be treated single performance obligation such initial fee received will likely be recognized over the franchise term we do not anticipate this impact to be material to the company consolidated statement of income and the cumulative catch up adjustment to be recorded deferred revenue upon adoption is expected to be approximately of the company consolidated long term liability no impact to the company consolidated statement of cash flow is expected the initial fee
