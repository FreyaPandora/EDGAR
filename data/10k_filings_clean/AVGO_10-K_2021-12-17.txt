motivate and retain our workforce the source of our technological and product innovation our engineering and technical personnel are significant asset competition for these and other talented employee is significant in many location where we operate such silicon valley and southeast asia we measure our employee engagement by our voluntary attrition rate and employee feedback our global voluntary attrition rate in fiscal year wa approximately below the technology industry benchmark aon salary increase and turnover study second edition september we also track the portion of our workforce in research and development role of october we had approximately employee worldwide with approximately in research and development role by geography approximately of our employee are located in north america in asia and in europe the middle east and africa governmental regulationour semiconductor manufacturing operation and research and development involve the use of hazardous substance and are regulated under international federal state and local law governing health safety and the environment these regulation include limitation on discharge of pollutant to air water and soil remediation requirement product chemical content limitation manufacturing chemical use and handling restriction pollution control requirement waste minimization consideration and treatment transport storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste we are also subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration and similar health and safety law in other jurisdiction we believe that our property and operation at our facility comply in all material respect with applicable environmental law and worker health and safety law however the risk of environmental liability can not be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental health and safety law to our business will not require to incur significant expenditure we are also regulated under number of international federal state and local law regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirement including legislation enacted in the european union and china among growing number of jurisdiction which have placed greater restriction on the use of lead among other substance in electronic product which affect material composition and semiconductor packaging in addition our business is subject to various import export regulation such the export administration regulation and applicable executive order and rule of industrial standard body like the international standard organization well regulation by other agency such the federal trade commission ftc these law regulation and order are complex may change frequently and with limited notice have generally and may continue to become more stringent over time we may incur significant expenditure in future period result seasonalityhistorically our net revenue ha typically been higher in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half primarily due to seasonality in our wireless communication product these product have historically experienced seasonality due to launch of new mobile handset manufactured by our oem customer however from time to time typical seasonality and industry cyclicality are overshadowed by other factor such wider macroeconomic effect the timing of significant product transition and launch by large oems particularly with our wireless communication product we have diversified business portfolio and we believe that our overall revenue is le

condition result of operation cash flow and the trading price of our common stock and preferred stock many of the following risk and uncertainty are and will continue to be exacerbated by the covid pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment result the following material factor among others could cause our actual result to differ materially from historical result and those expressed in forward looking statement made by or on our behalf in filing with the sec press release communication with investor and oral statement risk factor summarythe following is summary of the principal risk that could adversely affect our business operation and financial result risk related to our business the ongoing covid pandemic ha disrupted and will likely continue to disrupt normal business activity the majority of our sale come from small number of customer and reduction in demand or loss of one or more of our significant customer may adversely affect our business dependence on contract manufacturing and supplier of critical component within our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring product to market we purchase significant amount of the material used in our product from limited number of supplier our business is subject to various governmental regulation and trade restriction compliance with these regulation may cause to incur significant expense and if we fail to maintain compliance we may be forced to cease manufacture and distribution of certain product or subjected to administrative proceeding and civil or criminal penalty adverse global economic condition could have negative effect on we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry global political and economic condition and other factor related to our international operation could adversely affect we are subject to risk associated with our distributor and other channel partner including product inventory level and product sell through our dependence on senior management and if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively we may pursue acquisition investment joint venture and disposition which could adversely affect our result of operation we may be involved in legal proceeding including ip security litigation and employee related claim our operating result are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuation failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customer demand could adversely affect our result of operation winning business in the semiconductor solution industry is subject to lengthy process that often requires to incur significant expense from which we may ultimately generate no revenue competition in our industry could prevent from growing our revenue prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facility research and development facility warehouse or other significant operation or those of our supplier could have material adverse effect on we may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity or product yield at our own manufacturing facility any failure of our it system or one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendor to provide necessary service could have material adverse effect on our business our ability to maintain or improve gross margin our ability to protect the significant amount of ip in our business incompatibility of our software product with operating environment platform or third party product demand for our product and service could decrease failure to enter into software license agreement on satisfactory basis could adversely affect of content licensed third party software used in our product may not be available to in the future which may delay product development and production or cause to incur additional expense use of open source code source which under certain circumstance could materially adversely affect we are subject to warranty claim product recall and product liability the complexity of our product could result in unforeseen delay or expense or undetected defect or bug we make substantial investment in research and development and unsuccessful investment could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation we collect use store or otherwise process personal information which subject to privacy and data security law and contractual commitment and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such law and commitment could harm our business we are subject to environmental health and safety law which could increase our cost restrict our operation and require expenditure social and environmental responsibility regulation policy and provision well customer and investor demand may make our supply chain more complex and may adversely affect our relationship with customer and investor the average selling price of semiconductor product in our market have often decreased rapidly and may do so in the future breach of our security system may have material adverse effect on our business fluctuation in foreign exchange rate could result in loss risk relating to tax change in tax legislation or policy could materially impact our financial position and result of operation our corporate income tax could significantly increase if we are unable to maintain our tax concession or if our assumption and interpretation regarding tax law and concession prove to be incorrect our income tax and overall cash tax cost are affected by number of factor that could materially adversely affect financial result risk relating to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to execute our business strategy the instrument governing our indebtedness impose certain restriction on our business servicing our debt requires significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt risk relating to owning our common stock volatility of our stock price could result in substantial loss for our investor well class action litigation against and our management the amount and frequency of our stock repurchase may fluctuate substantial amount of our stock is held by small number of large investor there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividend for more complete discussion of the material risk facing our business see below risk related to our businessthe ongoing covid pandemic ha disrupted and will likely continue to disrupt normal business activity which may have an adverse effect on our result of operation the global spread of covid and the effort to control it have disrupted and reduced the efficiency of normal business activity in much of the world the pandemic ha resulted in authority around the world implementing numerous unprecedented measure such travel restriction quarantine shelter in place order factory and office shutdown and vaccine mandate these measure have impacted and will likely continue to impact our workforce and operation and those of our customer contract manufacturer cm supplier and logistics provider of contentswe have been and expect to continue experiencing some disruption to part of our global semiconductor supply chain including procuring necessary component and input such wafer and substrate in timely fashion with supplier increasing lead time or placing product on allocation and raising price in addition our primary warehouse and number of our key supplier particularly assembly and test service provider are in malaysia while our malaysia warehouse ha remained fully operational many of the facility of our key supplier and other service provider were shut or operated at reduced capacity for extended period this resulted in significant logistical challenge and product delay which could recur in the event of any future closure of or period of reduced operation at our warehouse or the facility of our supplier and provider any similar disruption at our fort collins colorado manufacturing facility would severely impact our ability to manufacture our fbar product and adversely affect our wireless business in addition disruption to commercial transportation infrastructure have increased delivery time for material and component to our facility transfer of our product to our key supplier and in some case our ability to timely ship our product to customer result of these supply chain disruption we have increased customer order lead time and placed some product on allocation we are also largely building semiconductor product to order demand continues to outpace supply this ha limited and may continue to limit our ability to fulfill order and satisfy all of the demand for our product which may adversely affect our relationship with our customer in response to governmental directive and recommended safety measure we modified our workplace practice globally which ha resulted in many of our employee working remotely for extended period of time working remotely for extended period may reduce our employee efficiency and productivity which may cause product development delay hamper new product innovation and have other unforeseen adverse effect on our business in addition if significant number of our employee or employee and third party performing key function including our chief executive officer and member of our board of director become ill our business may be adversely impacted while we have implemented personal safety measure at all of our facility where our employee are working onsite we may need to modify our business practice and policy in manner that may adversely impact our business especially if the spread of covid including any variant worsen significantly and existing and new precautionary measure could negatively impact our operation in addition any action we take may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of infection and could result in significant number of covid related claim change to state worker compensation law such those in california may increase our potential liability for such claim while we continue to see robust demand in our semiconductor solution segment and record profitability driven by the supply imbalance and have seen little impact to our software business from the covid pandemic the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and it may not be sustainable over the longer term the degree to which the pandemic ultimately impact our business and result of operation will depend on future development beyond our control including the extent of action to contain the virus including any variant availability and efficacy of the vaccine or other treatment public acceptance of the vaccine including booster and how quickly and to extent normal economic and operating condition resume the majority of our sale come from small number of customer and reduction in demand or loss of one or more of our significant customer may adversely affect our business we are dependent on small number of end customer oems their respective cm and certain distributor for majority of our business revenue and result of operation for fiscal year sale to distributor accounted for of our net revenue we believe aggregate sale through all channel to apple and our top five end customer accounted for approximately and more than of our net revenue for fiscal year respectively this customer concentration increase the risk of quarterly fluctuation in our operating result and our sensitivity to any material adverse development experienced by our significant customer the term and condition under which we do business with most of our semiconductor customer generally do not include commitment to purchase any specific quantity of product even in those instance where we have an arrangement under which customer agrees to source an agreed portion of it product need from provided we meet our contractual obligation the arrangement often includes pricing schedule or methodology that apply regardless of the volume of product purchased and those customer may not purchase the amount of product we expect result we may not generate the amount of revenue or achieve the level of profitability we expect under such arrangement moreover our top customer purchasing power ha in some case given them the ability to make greater demand on with regard to pricing and contractual term in general we expect this trend to continue which may adversely affect our gross margin on certain product and should we fail to perform under these arrangement we could also be liable for significant monetary damage the loss of or any substantial reduction in sale to any of our major customer could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow of contentsdependence on contract manufacturing and supplier of critical component within our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring product to market damage our reputation and adversely affect our result of operation we operate primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes cm such third party wafer foundry and module assembly and test capability our semiconductor product require wafer manufacturer with state of the art fabrication equipment and technique and most of our product are designed to be manufactured in specific process typically at one particular fab or foundry either our own or with particular cm we depend on our cm to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our need to produce product of acceptable quality at acceptable yield and to deliver those product to on timely basis we do not generally have long term capacity commitment with our cm and substantially all of our manufacturing service are on purchase order basis with no minimum quantity further our cm may fail to timely develop new advanced manufacturing process including transition to smaller geometry process technology or from time to time will cease to or will become unable to manufacture component for lead time to identify qualify and establish reliable production at acceptable yield with new cm is typically lengthy there is often no readily available alternative source and there may be other constraint on our ability to change cm in addition qualifying such cm is often expensive and they may not produce product cost effectively our current supplier tsmc one of our cm manufactured approximately of the wafer manufactured by our cm during fiscal year our wafer requirement represent significant portion of the total production capacity of tsmc however tsmc also fabricates wafer for other company including certain of our competitor and could choose or be required to prioritize capacity for other customer or reduce or eliminate delivery to on short notice in addition tsmc ha and may in the future raise their price to if any of the foregoing circumstance occur we may be unable to meet our customer demand or to the extent our competitor fail to meet our contractual obligation or forgo revenue opportunity this ha in the past damaged and may in the future damage our relationship with our customer this could also result in litigation for alleged failure to meet our obligation payment of significant damage and our net revenue could decline adversely affecting our business financial condition result of operation and gross margin further any substantial disruption in the contract manufacturing service that we utilize including tsmc supply of wafer to result of natural disaster climate change water shortage political unrest military conflict geopolitical turmoil trade tension government order medical epidemic such the covid pandemic economic instability equipment failure or other cause could materially harm our business customer relationship and result of operation we purchase significant amount of the material used in our product from limited number of supplier our manufacturing process and those of our cm rely on many material including silicon gaas and inp wafer copper lead frame precious and rare earth metal mold compound ceramic package and various chemical and gas we purchase significant portion of our material component and finished good used in our product from material provider some of which are single source supplier certain material are highly specialized the lead time needed to identify and qualify new supplier is typically lengthy and there is often no readily available alternative source during fiscal year we purchased approximately two third of our manufacturing material from five material provider we do not generally have long term contract with our material provider and substantially all of our purchase are on purchase order basis supplier may extend lead time limit supply place product on allocation or increase price due to commodity price increase capacity constraint inflation or other factor any of which could lead to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry for example due to the covid pandemic we have experienced some supply constraint and increase in price including with respect to wafer and substrate additionally the supply of these material may be negatively impacted by increased trade tension between the and it trading partner particularly china these supply constraint have had and may continue to have negative impact on our customer relationship further continued supply constraint for these or any other reason could result in loss of revenue opportunity and adversely impact our business financial condition and result of operation our business is subject to various governmental regulation and compliance with these regulation may cause to incur significant expense if we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulation we may be forced to cease the manufacture and distribution of certain product and we could be subject to administrative proceeding and civil or criminal penalty our business is subject to various domestic and international law and other legal requirement including anti competition and import export regulation such the export administration regulation and applicable executive order these law regulation and order are complex may change frequently and with limited notice have generally and may continue to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with or to remedy violation of these regulation in addition if our customer fail to comply with these regulation we may be of contentsrequired to suspend sale to these customer which could damage our reputation and negatively impact our result of operation the government may also add company to it restricted entity list and or technology to it list of prohibited export to specific country which have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our product and our revenue for example huawei technology co ltd one of our customer is subject to certain export restriction which ha required to suspend sale to huawei until we obtain license from the department of commerce we may be unable to obtain or maintain the necessary license to allow to export product to them these restrictive governmental action and any similar measure that may be imposed on company by other government especially in light of ongoing trade tension with china will likely limit or prevent from doing business with certain of our customer or supplier and harm our ability to compete effectively or otherwise negatively affect our ability to sell our product and adversely affect our business and result of operation our product and operation are also subject to regulation by and non regulatory agency such the federal trade commission ftc from time to time we may also be involved or required to participate in regulatory investigation or inquiry such the ongoing investigation by the korean fair trade commission into certain of our contracting and business practice which may evolve into legal or other administrative proceeding growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporation is likely to result in increased anti competition legislation regulation administrative rule making and enforcement activity involvement in regulatory investigation or inquiry can be costly lengthy complex and time consuming diverting the attention and energy of our management and technical personnel if any pending or future governmental investigation result in an unfavorable resolution we could be required to cease the manufacture and sale of the subject product or technology pay fine or disgorge profit or other payment and or cease certain conduct and or modify our contracting or business practice which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former director or employee or former director or employee of company that we have acquired in connection with regulatory investigation these liability could be substantial and may include among other thing the cost of government law enforcement or regulatory investigation and civil or criminal fine and penalty in addition the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductor must comply with various law and adapt to change in regulatory requirement they occur for example if country in which our product are manufactured or sold set technical standard that are not widely shared it may require to stop distributing our product commercially until they comply with such new standard lead certain of our customer to suspend import of their product into that country require manufacturer in that country to manufacture product with different technical standard and disrupt cross border manufacturing relationship any of which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation if we fail to comply with these requirement we could also be required to pay civil penalty or face criminal prosecution adverse global economic condition could have negative effect on our business result of operation and financial condition and liquidity general slowdown in the global economy or in particular region or industry an increase in trade tension with trading partner inflation or tightening of the credit market could negatively impact our business financial condition and liquidity adverse global economic condition have from time to time caused or exacerbated significant slowdown in the industry and market in which we operate which have adversely affected our business and result of operation macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for to accurately forecast revenue gross margin and expense and may make it more difficult to raise or refinance debt an escalation of trade tension between the and china ha resulted in trade restriction and increased tariff that harm our ability to participate in chinese market or compete effectively with chinese company sustained uncertainty about or worsening of current global economic condition and further escalation of trade tension between the and it trading partner especially china and possible decoupling of the and china economy could result in global economic slowdown and long term change to global trade such event may also cause our customer and consumer to reduce delay or forgo technology spending ii result in customer sourcing product from other supplier not subject to such restriction or tariff iii lead to the insolvency or consolidation of key supplier and customer and iv intensify pricing pressure any or all of these factor could negatively affect demand for our product and our business financial condition and result of operation we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change and price erosion evolving technical standard frequent new product introduction short product life cycle for semiconductor and for many of the end product in which they are used and wide fluctuation in product supply and demand from time to time these factor together with change in general economic condition cause significant upturn and downturn in the industry in general and in our business in particular the industry ha experienced significant upturn due to the supply imbalance resulting in record profitability and increase in average selling price which may not be sustainable in the longer term of contentsconversely period of industry downturn have been characterized by diminished demand for end user product high inventory level and period of inventory adjustment under utilization of manufacturing capacity change in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling price we expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturn even overall economic condition are relatively stable if we can not offset industry or market downturn our net revenue may decline and our financial condition and result of operation may suffer global political and economic condition and other factor related to our international operation could adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation majority of our product are produced sourced and sold internationally and our international revenue represents significant percentage of our overall revenue in addition of october approximately of our employee were located outside the multiple factor relating to our international operation and to particular country in which we operate could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation these factor include change in political regulatory legal or economic condition or geopolitical turmoil including terrorism war or political or military coup or civil disturbance or political instability foreign and domestic restrictive governmental action such restriction on the transfer or repatriation of fund and foreign investment data privacy regulation imposition of climate change regulation and trade protection measure including increasing protectionism import export restriction import export duty and quota trade sanction and custom duty and tariff all of which have increased in recent year difficulty in obtaining product distribution and support and transportation delay potential inability to localize software product for significant number of international market difficulty in conducting due diligence with respect to business partner in certain international market public health or safety concern medical epidemic or pandemic such covid and other natural or man made disaster nationalization of business and expropriation of asset and change in and foreign tax law significant legal risk associated with conducting business internationally is compliance with the various and differing law and regulation of the many country in which we do business in addition the law in various country are constantly evolving and may in some case conflict with each other although our policy prohibit our employee and our agent from engaging in unethical business practice there can be no assurance that all of our employee distributor or other agent will refrain from acting in violation of our related anti corruption or other policy and procedure any such violation could have material adverse effect on our business we are subject to risk associated with our distributor and other channel partner including product inventory level and product sell through we sell our product through direct sale force and select network of distributor and other channel partner globally sale to distributor accounted for of our net revenue in the fiscal year ended october and are subject to number of risk including fluctuation in demand based on our distributor product inventory level and end customer demand in given quarter our distributor and other channel partner are generally not subject to minimum sale requirement or any obligation to market our product to their customer our distributor and other channel partner agreement are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our product to end customer and our distributor and other channel partner may market and distribute competing product and may place greater emphasis on the sale of these product in addition we are selling our semiconductor product through an increasingly limited number of distributor which expose to additional customer concentration and related credit risk of contentswe do not always have direct relationship with the end customer of our product result our semiconductor product may be used in application for which they were not necessarily designed or tested including for example medical device and they may not perform anticipated in such application in such event failure of even small number of part could result in significant liability to damage our reputation and harm our business and result of operation our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing member of our senior management team our success depends in large part on the continued contribution of our senior management team and in particular the service of mr hock tan our president and chief executive officer effective succession planning is also important for our long term success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transition involving senior management could hinder our strategic planning and execution none of our senior management is bound by written employment contract in addition we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our senior management the loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market condition in which we operate if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel especially our engineering and technical personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively our future success depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the source of our technological and product innovation our engineering and technical personnel including cyber security expert are significant asset competition for these employee is significant in many area of the world in which we operate particularly in silicon valley and southeast asia where qualified engineer are in high demand in addition current or future immigration law may make it more difficult to hire or retain qualified engineer further limiting the pool of available talent further our employee may decide not to continue working for and may leave with little or no notice we believe equity award provide powerful long term retention incentive and have historically granted these award to the substantial majority of our employee however the amendment to our stock incentive plan approved by our stockholder at our annual meeting of stockholder significantly reduced the number of share available for equity award result we may need to change our current equity granting philosophy which could impair our effort to attract and retain necessary personnel any inability to retain attract or motivate such personnel could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation we may pursue acquisition investment joint venture and disposition which could adversely affect our result of operation our growth strategy includes acquiring or investing in business that offer complementary product service and technology or enhance our market coverage or technological capability any acquisition we may undertake and their integration involve risk and uncertainty such unexpected delay challenge and related expense and disruption of our business diversion of management attention from daily operation and the pursuit of other opportunity incurring significant restructuring charge and amortization expense assuming liability some of which may be unexpected and ongoing or new lawsuit related to the transaction or otherwise potential impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible asset and increasing our expense and working capital requirement the potential for deficiency in internal control at the acquired business well implementing our own management information system operating system and internal control for the acquired operation our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issue with the acquired company product financial disclosure accounting practice legal tax and other contingency compliance with local law and regulation and interpretation thereof in the and multiple international jurisdiction additional acquisition related debt which could increase our leverage and potentially negatively affect our credit rating resulting in more restrictive borrowing term or increased borrowing cost thereby limiting our ability to borrow dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholder difficulty integrating the acquired business or company and in managing and retaining acquired employee vendor and customer and inaccuracy in our original estimate and assumption used to ass transaction which may result in not realizing the expected financial or strategic benefit of any such transaction of contentsin addition the current and the proposed change to the and foreign regulatory approval process and requirement in connection with an acquisition may cause approval to take longer than anticipated to obtain not be forthcoming or contain burdensome condition which may jeopardize delay or reduce the anticipated benefit of the transaction to and could impede the execution of our business strategy from time to time we may also seek to divest or wind down portion of our business either acquired or otherwise or we may exit minority investment any of which could materially affect our cash flow and result of operation such disposition involve risk and uncertainty including our ability to sell such business on term acceptable to or at all disruption to other part of our business potential loss of employee or customer or exposure to unanticipated liability or ongoing obligation to following any such disposition in addition disposition may include the transfer of technology and or the licensing of certain ip right to third party purchaser which could limit our ability to utilize such ip right or assert these right against such third party purchaser or other third party we may be involved in legal proceeding including ip security litigation and employee related claim which could among other thing divert effort of management and result in significant expense and loss of our ip right we are often involved in legal proceeding including case involving our ip right and those of others commercial matter acquisition related suit security class action suit employee related claim and other action litigation or settlement of such action regardless of their merit can be costly lengthy complex and time consuming diverting the attention and energy of our management and technical personnel the industry in which we operate are characterized by company holding large number of patent copyright trademark and trade secret and by the vigorous pursuit protection and enforcement of ip right including action by patent holding company that do not make or sell product from time to time third party assert against and our customer and distributor their ip right to technology that are important to our business for example in august judgment wa entered against broadcom and apple for infringement of certain patent pursuant to which california institute of technology wa awarded past damage of million from broadcom and million from apple for which apple is seeking indemnification from broadcom although we are appealing this judgment there are no assurance that we will be successful many of our customer agreement and in some case our asset sale agreement and or the law of certain jurisdiction may require to indemnify our customer or purchaser for third party ip infringement claim including cost to defend those claim and payment of damage in the case of adverse ruling however our cm and supplier may or may not be required to indemnify should we or our customer be subject to such third party claim claim of this sort could also harm our relationship with our customer and might deter future customer from doing business with if any pending or future proceeding result in an adverse outcome we could be required to cease the manufacture use or sale of the infringing product process or technology and or make change to our process or product pay substantial damage for past present and future use of the infringing technology including to treble damage if willful infringement is found expend significant resource to develop non infringing technology license technology from the third party claiming infringement which license may not be available on commercially reasonable term or at all enter into cross license with our competitor which could weaken our overall ip portfolio and our ability to compete in particular product category pay substantial damage to our direct or end customer to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non infringing technology or relinquish ip right associated with one or more of our patent claim any of the foregoing result could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation in addition we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former director or employee or former director or employee of company that we have acquired in connection with such litigation these liability could be substantial and may include among other thing the cost of defending lawsuit against these individual well stockholder derivative suit civil or criminal fine and penalty legal and other expense and expense associated with the remedial measure if any which may be imposed of contentsour operating result are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuation our operating result have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future these fluctuation may occur on quarterly and annual basis and are due to number of factor many of which are beyond our control in addition to many of the risk described elsewhere in this risk factor section these factor include among others the timing of launch by our customer of new product in which our product are included and change in end user demand for our customer the product fluctuation in the level of component or product inventory held by our customer the shift to cloud based it solution and service such hyperscale computing which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sale of our product for use in traditional enterprise data center the timing of new software contract and renewal well the timing of any termination of software contract that require to refund to customer any pre paid amount under the contract our ability to timely develop introduce and market new product and technology the timing and extent of our software license and subscription revenue and other non product revenue new product announcement and introduction by or our competitor seasonality or other fluctuation in demand in our market timing and amount of research and development and related new product expenditure and the timing of receipt of any research and development grant monies and timing of any regulatory change particularly with respect to trade sanction and custom duty and tariff and tax reform the foregoing factor are often difficult to predict and these well other factor could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating result in addition significant amount of our operating expense are relatively fixed in nature any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our result of operation result we believe that quarter to quarter comparison of our revenue and operating result may not be meaningful or reliable indicator of our future performance if our operating result in one or more future quarter fail to meet the expectation of security analyst or investor significant decline in the trading price of our common stock may occur which may happen immediately or over time failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customer demand could adversely affect our result of operation we make significant decision including determining the level of business that we will seek and accept production schedule level of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirement based on our estimate of customer requirement which may not be accurate during the covid pandemic we have moved largely to build to order model and have extended customer lead time substantially in light of supply chain challenge more typically however to ensure the availability of our semiconductor product we start manufacturing based on customer forecast which are not binding result we incur inventory and manufacturing cost in advance of anticipated sale that may be substantially lower than expected if actual demand for our product is lower than forecast we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating cost and product obsolescence certain of our sale research and development and internal manufacturing overhead expense are relatively fixed reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income conversely customer often require rapid increase in production on short notice if we are unable to meet such increase in demand this could damage our customer relationship reduce revenue growth and margin subject to additional liability harm our reputation and prevent from taking advantage of opportunity winning business in the semiconductor solution industry is subject to lengthy process that often requires to incur significant expense from which we may ultimately generate no revenue our semiconductor business is dependent on winning competitive bid selection process known design win these selection process are typically lengthy and can require to dedicate significant development expenditure and scarce engineering resource in pursuit of single customer opportunity failure to obtain particular design win may prevent from obtaining design win in subsequent generation of particular product this can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection process of contentswinning product design doe not guarantee sale to customer delay or cancellation of customer plan could materially and adversely affect our financial result we incur significant expense in the design process and may generate little or no revenue from it in addition the timing of design win is unpredictable and implementing production for major design win or multiple design win at the same time may strain our resource and those of our cm in such event we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resource and incur additional cost and expense further often customer will only purchase limited number of evaluation unit until they qualify the product and or the manufacturing line for those product the qualification process can take significant time and resource delay in qualification or failure to qualify our product may cause customer to discontinue use of our product and result in significant loss of revenue finally customer could choose at any time to stop using our product or could fail to successfully market and sell their product which could reduce demand for our product and cause to hold excess inventory materially adversely affecting our business financial condition and result of operation these risk are exacerbated by the fact that many of our product and the end product into which our product are incorporated often have very short life cycle competition in our industry could prevent from growing our revenue the industry in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standard change in customer requirement often aggressive pricing practice and in some case new delivery method we expect competition in these industry to continue to increase existing competitor improve or expand their product offering or new competitor enter our market some of our competitor have longer operating history greater name recognition larger installed customer base larger technical staff more established relationship with vendor or supplier or greater manufacturing distribution financial research and development technical and marketing resource than we also face competition from numerous smaller company that specialize in specific aspect of the highly fragmented software industry open source author who provide software and ip for free competitor who offer their product through try and buy or freemium model and customer who develop competing product in addition the trend toward consolidation is changing the competitive landscape we expect this trend to continue which may result in combined competitor greater resource than some of our competitor may also receive financial and other support from their home country government or may have greater presence in key market larger customer base more comprehensive ip portfolio or better patent protection than the action of our competitor in the area of pricing and product bundling in particular could have substantial adverse impact on further competitor may leverage their superior market position well ip or other proprietary information including interface interoperability or technical information in new and emerging technology and platform that may inhibit our ability to compete effectively if we are unable to compete successfully we may lose market share for our product or incur significant reduction in our gross margin either of which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facility research and development facility warehouse or other significant operation or those of our supplier could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation although we operate primarily outsourced manufacturing business model we also rely on our own manufacturing facility in particular in fort collins colorado singapore and breinigsville pennsylvania we use these internal fabrication facility for product utilizing our innovative and proprietary process our fort collins and breinigsville facility are the sole source for the fbar component used in many of our wireless device and for the indium phosphide based wafer used in our fibre optic product respectively many of our facility and those of our cm and supplier are located in california and the pacific rim region which have average seismic activity and severe weather activity in addition significant majority of our research and development personnel are located the czech republic india israel singapore and the with the expertise of the personnel at each such location tending to be focused on one or two specific area and our primary warehouse is in malaysia prolonged disruption at or shut down of one or more of our manufacturing facility or warehouse especially our colorado singapore malaysia and pennsylvania facility or those of our cm or supplier due to natural or man made disaster or other event outside of our control such equipment malfunction or widespread outbreak of acute illness including covid or for any other reason would limit our capacity to meet customer demand and delay new product development until replacement facility and equipment if necessary were found any such event would likely disrupt our operation delay production shipment and revenue result in unable to timely satisfy customer demand expose to claim by our customer result in significant expense to repair or replace our affected facility and in some instance could significantly curtail our research and development effort in particular product area or target market result we could forgo revenue opportunity potentially lose market share damage our customer relationship and be subject to of contentslitigation and additional liability all of which could materially and adversely affect our business although we purchase insurance to mitigate certain loss such insurance often carry high deductible amount and any uninsured loss could negatively affect our operating result in addition even if we were able to promptly resume production of our affected product if our customer can not timely resume their own manufacturing following such an event they may cancel or scale back their order from and this may in turn adversely affect our result of operation such event could also result in increased fixed cost relative to the revenue we generate and adversely affect our result of operation we may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity or product yield at our own manufacturing facility which could adversely affect our relationship with our customer and our business financial condition and result of operation we must maintain appropriate capacity and product yield at our own manufacturing facility to meet anticipated customer demand from time to time this requires to invest in expansion or improvement of those facility which often involves substantial cost and other risk such expanded manufacturing capacity may still be insufficient or may not come online soon enough to meet customer demand and we may have to put customer on product allocation forgo sale or lose customer result conversely if we overestimate customer demand we would experience excess capacity and fixed cost at these facility will not be fully absorbed all of which could adversely affect our result of operation similarly reduced product yield due to design or manufacturing issue or otherwise may involve significant time and cost to remedy and cause delay in our ability to supply product to our customer all of which could cause to forgo sale incur liability or lose customer and harm our result of operation in addition current and future government restriction imposed result of the covid pandemic that limit our manufacturing capability could severely impact our ability to manufacture our proprietary product adversely affecting our wireless business any failure of our it system or one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendor to provide necessary service could have material adverse effect on our business our business depends on various it system and outsourced it service we rely on third party vendor to provide critical corporate infrastructure service and to adequately address cyber security threat to their own system service provided by these third party include service related to financial reporting product order and shipping human resource benefit plan administration it network development and network monitoring while we may be entitled to damage if our vendor fail to perform under their agreement with any award may be insufficient to cover the actual cost incurred by and result of vendor failure to perform we may be unable to collect any damage any failure of these internal or third party system and service to operate effectively could disrupt our operation and could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation our gross margin is dependent on number of factor including our product mix price erosion acquisition we may make level of capacity utilization and commodity price our gross margin is highly dependent on product mix which is susceptible to seasonal and other fluctuation in our market shift in sale mix away from our higher margin product well the timing and amount of our software licensing and non product revenue could adversely affect our future gross margin percentage in addition increased competition and the existence of product alternative more complex engineering requirement lower demand or reduction in our technological lead compared to our competitor and other factor have in the past and may in the future lead to further price erosion lower revenue and lower margin conversely period of robust demand that create supply imbalance we have seen recently can lead to higher gross margin that may not be sustainable over the longer term in addition semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment leading to high fixed cost including depreciation expense if we are unable to utilize our owned manufacturing facility at high level the fixed cost associated with these facility will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit cost and lower gross margin furthermore we do not hedge our exposure to commodity price some of which are very volatile and sudden or prolonged increase in commodity price may adversely affect our gross margin our gross margin may also be adversely affected if business or company that we acquire have different gross margin profile and by expense related to such acquisition we utilize significant amount of ip in our business if we are unable or fail to protect our ip our business could be adversely affected our success depends in part upon protecting our ip to accomplish this we rely on combination of ip right including patent copyright trademark and trade secret well customary contractual protection with our customer supplier employee and consultant we spend significant resource to monitor and protect our ip right including the unauthorized of contentsuse of our product usage rate of the software seat license and subscription that we sell and even with significant expenditure we may not be able to protect the ip right that are valuable to our business we are unable to predict or assure that our ip right will not lapse or be invalidated circumvented challenged or in the case of third party ip right licensed to be licensed to others our ip right will provide competitive advantage to right previously granted by third party to ip licensed or assigned to including portfolio cross license will not hamper our ability to assert our ip right or hinder the settlement of currently pending or future dispute any of our pending or future patent trademark or copyright application will be issued or have the coverage originally sought our ip right will be enforced in certain jurisdiction where competition is intense or where legal protection may be weak or we have sufficient ip right to protect our product or our business effective ip protection may be unavailable or more limited in other jurisdiction relative to those protection available in the and may not be applied for or may be abandoned in one or more relevant jurisdiction in addition when patent expire we lose the protection and competitive advantage they provided to we also generate revenue from licensing royalty payment and from technology claim settlement relating to certain of our ip licensing of our ip right particularly exclusive license may limit our ability to assert those ip right against third party including the licensee of those right in addition we may acquire company with ip that is subject to licensing obligation to other third party these licensing obligation may extend to our own ip following any such acquisition and may limit our ability to assert our ip right from time to time we pursue litigation to assert our ip right including in some case against our customer and supplier claim of this sort could also harm our relationship with our customer and might deter future customer from doing business with conversely third party have and may in the future pursue ip litigation against including result of our ip licensing business an adverse decision in such type of legal action could limit our ability to assert our ip right and limit the value of our technology including the loss of opportunity to sell or license our technology to others or to collect royalty payment which could otherwise negatively impact our business financial condition and result of operation from time to time we may need to obtain additional ip license or renew existing license agreement we are unable to predict whether these license agreement can be obtained or renewed on acceptable term or at all if our software product do not remain compatible with ever changing operating environment platform or third party product demand for our product and service could decrease which could materially adversely affect our business we may be required to make substantial modification of our product to maintain compatibility with operating system system software and computer hardware used by our customer or to provide our customer with desired feature or capability we must also continually address the challenge of dynamic and accelerating market trend and competitive development such the emergence of advanced persistent threat in the security space to compete effectively there can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt our product in response to these development further our software solution interact with variety of software and hardware developed by third party if we lose access to third party code and specification for the development of code this could negatively impact our ability to develop compatible software in addition if software provider and hardware manufacturer including some of our largest vendor adopt new policy restricting the use or availability of their code or technical documentation for their operating system application or hardware or otherwise impose unfavorable term and condition for such access this could result in higher research and development cost for the enhancement and modification of our existing product or development of new product any additional restriction could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result and cash flow failure to enter into software license agreement on satisfactory basis could materially adversely affect our business many of our existing customer have multi year enterprise software license agreement some of which involve substantial aggregate fee amount customer renewal rate may decline or fluctuate result of number of factor including the level of customer satisfaction with our solution or customer support customer budget and the pricing of our solution compared with the solution offered by our competitor any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected if at all the failure to renew customer agreement of similar scope on term that are commercially attractive to could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result and cash flow of contentscertain software that we use in our product is licensed from third party and may not be available to in the future which may delay product development and production or cause to incur additional expense some of our solution contain software licensed from third party some of which may not be available to in the future on term that are acceptable to or allow our product to remain competitive the loss of these license or the inability to maintain any of them on commercially acceptable term could delay development of future product or the enhancement of existing product certain software we use is from open source code source which under certain circumstance could materially adversely affect our business financial condition operating result and cash flow some of our product contain software from open source code source the use of which may subject to certain condition including the obligation to offer such product for no cost or to make the proprietary source code of those product publicly available further although some open source vendor provide warranty and support agreement it is common for such software to be available is with no warranty indemnity or support although we monitor our use of such open source code to avoid subjecting our product to unintended condition such use under certain circumstance could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result and cash flow including if we are required to take remedial action that may divert resource away from our development effort we are subject to warranty claim product recall and product liability from time to time we may be subject to warranty or product liability claim that may lead to significant expense our customer contract typically contain warranty and indemnification provision and in certain case may also contain liquidated damage provision relating to product quality issue the potential liability associated with such provision are significant and in some case including in agreement with some of our largest customer are potentially unlimited any such liability may greatly exceed any revenue we receive from the relevant product cost payment or damage incurred or paid by in connection with warranty and product liability claim and product recall could materially adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation we may also be exposed to such claim result of any acquisition we may undertake in the future product liability insurance is subject to significant deductible and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claim or we may elect to self insure with respect to certain matter for example it is possible for one of our customer to recall product containing one of our semiconductor device in such an event we may incur significant cost and expense including among others replacement cost contract damage claim from our customer and reputational harm although we maintain reserve for reasonably estimable liability and purchase product liability insurance our reserve may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claim conversely in some case amount we reserve may ultimately exceed our actual liability for particular claim and may need to be reversed the complexity of our product could result in unforeseen delay or expense or undetected defect or bug which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new product damage our reputation with current or prospective customer and materially and adversely affect our operating cost highly complex product such those we offer may contain defect and bug when they are first introduced or new version software documentation or enhancement are released or their release may be delayed due to unforeseen difficulty during product development if any of our product or third party component used in our product contain defect or bug or have reliability quality or compatibility problem we may not be able to successfully design workarounds furthermore if any of these problem are not discovered until after we have commenced commercial production or deployment of new product we may be required to incur additional development cost and product recall repair or replacement cost significant technical challenge also arise with our software product because our customer license and deploy our product across variety of computer platform and integrate them with number of third party software application and database result if there is system wide failure or an actual or perceived breach of information integrity security or availability occurs in one of our end user customer system it can be difficult to determine which product is at fault and we could ultimately be harmed by the failure of another supplier product consequently our reputation may be damaged and customer may be reluctant to buy our product which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customer and attract new customer to resolve these problem we may have to invest significant capital and other resource and we would likely lose or experience delay in market acceptance of the affected product or product these problem may also result in claim against by our customer or others for example if delay in the manufacture and delivery of our product cause the delay of customer end product delivery we may be required under the term of our agreement with that customer to compensate the customer for the adverse effect of such delay result our financial result could be materially adversely affected of contentswe make substantial investment in research and development and unsuccessful investment could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation the industry in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change change in customer requirement frequent new product introduction and enhancement short product cycle and evolving industry standard and new delivery method in addition semiconductor product transition over time to increasingly smaller line width geometry and failure to successfully transition to smaller geometry process technology could impair our competitive position in order to remain competitive we have made and expect to continue to make significant investment in research and development if we fail to develop new and enhanced product and technology if we focus on technology that do not become widely adopted or if new competitive technology that we do not support become widely accepted demand for our product may be reduced increased investment in research and development or unsuccessful research and development effort could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our product which would have negative impact on our financial result we collect use store or otherwise process personal information which subject to privacy and data security law and contractual commitment and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such law and commitment could harm our business we collect use and store collectively process high volume variety and velocity of certain personal information in connection with the operation of our business this creates various level of privacy risk across different part of our business depending on the type of personal information the jurisdiction in question and the purpose of their processing the personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal state local and foreign law and regulation regarding privacy and data security well contractual commitment privacy legislation and other data protection regulation enforcement and policy activity in this area are expanding rapidly in many jurisdiction and creating complex regulatory compliance environment sectoral legislation certification requirement and technical standard applying to certain category of our customer such those is the financial service or public sector are likely to further exacerbate this trend the cost of complying with and implementing these privacy related and data governance measure could be significant they may create additional burdensome security business process business record or data localization requirement concern about government interference sovereignty expanding privacy cyber security and data governance legislation could adversely affect our customer and our product and service particularly in cloud computing artificial intelligence and our own data management practice the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by to run our business could result in significantly increased business and security cost or cost related to defending legal claim any inadvertent failure or perceived failure by to comply with privacy data governance or cyber security obligation may result in governmental enforcement action litigation substantial fine and damage and could cause our customer to lose trust in which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business we are subject to environmental health and safety law which could increase our cost restrict our operation and require expenditure that could have material adverse effect on our result of operation and financial condition we are subject to variety of international law and regulation relating to the use disposal clean up of and human exposure to hazardous material compliance with environmental health and safety requirement could among other thing require to modify our manufacturing process restrict our ability to expand our facility or require to acquire pollution control equipment all of which can be very costly any failure by to comply with such requirement could result in the limitation or suspension of the manufacture of our product and could result in litigation against and the payment of significant fine and damage by in the event of significant adverse judgment in addition complying with any cleanup or remediation obligation for which we are or become responsible could be costly and have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation changing requirement relating to the material composition of our semiconductor product including the restriction on lead and certain other substance in electronic product sold in various country including the china and japan and in the european union increase the complexity and cost of our product design and procurement operation and may require to re engineer our product such re engineering may result in excess inventory or other additional cost and could have material adverse effect on our result of operation we may also experience claim from employee from time to time with regard to exposure to hazardous material or other workplace related environmental claim social and environmental responsibility regulation policy and provision well customer and investor demand may make our supply chain more complex and may adversely affect our relationship with customer and investor there is an increasing focus on corporate social and environmental responsibility in the semiconductor industry particularly with oems that manufacture consumer electronics number of our customer have adopted or may adopt procurement policy that include social and environmental responsibility provision or requirement that their supplier should comply with or they may seek to include such provision or requirement in their procurement term and condition of contentsan increasing number of investor are also requiring company to disclose corporate social and environmental policy practice and metric in addition various jurisdiction are developing climate change based law or regulation that could cause to incur additional direct cost for compliance well indirect cost resulting from our customer supplier or both incurring additional compliance cost that are passed on to these legal and regulatory requirement well investor expectation on corporate environmental and social responsibility practice and disclosure are subject to change can be unpredictable and may be difficult and expensive for to comply with given the complexity of our supply chain and our significant outsourced manufacturing if we are unable to comply or are unable to cause our supplier or cm to comply with such policy or provision or meet the requirement of our customer and investor customer may stop purchasing product from or an investor may sell their share and may take legal action against which could harm our reputation revenue and result of operation in addition part of their corporate social and environmental responsibility program an increasing number of oems are seeking to source product that do not contain mineral sourced from area where proceeds from the sale of such mineral are likely to be used to fund armed conflict such in the democratic republic of congo this could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of mineral used in the manufacture of semiconductor device including our product result we may face difficulty in satisfying these customer demand which may harm our sale and operating result the average selling price of semiconductor product in our market have often decreased rapidly and may do so in the future which could harm our revenue and gross profit the semiconductor product we develop and sell are used for high volume application result the price of those product have often decreased rapidly gross profit on our product may be negatively affected by among other thing pricing pressure from our customer in the past we have reduced the average selling price of our product in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressure new product introduction by or our competitor and other factor in addition some of our customer agreement provide for volume based pricing and product pricing roadmaps which can also reduce the average selling price of our product over time our margin and financial result will suffer if we are unable to offset any reduction in our average selling price by increasing our sale volume reducing manufacturing cost or developing new and higher value added product on timely basis breach of our security system may have material adverse effect on our business our security system are designed to protect and secure our facility and our customer supplier and employee confidential information well our own proprietary information however we are also dependent on number of third party cloud based and other service provider of critical corporate infrastructure service relating to among other thing human resource electronic communication service and certain finance function and we are out of necessity dependent on the security system of these provider in addition all software including the security technology produced by have had occasionally in the past and may have in the future vulnerability that if left unmanaged could reduce the overall level of security accidental or willful security breach or other unauthorized access of our facility our information system or the system of our service provider or the existence of computer virus or malware such ransomware in our or their data or software could expose to risk of information loss business disruption and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information including information relating to our product or customer and the personal information of our employee we have from time to time been subject to or there have been attempt of unauthorized network intrusion and malware on our own it network result of the covid pandemic remote access to our network and system ha increased substantially while we have taken step to secure our network and system we may be more vulnerable to successful cyber attack or information security incident when our workforce work remotely certain aspect of our software product are intended to manage and secure it infrastructure and environment and result we expect these product to be ongoing target of cyber security attack open source code or other third party software used in these product could also be targeted additionally we use third party data center which may also be subject to hacking or accidental incident although we continually seek to improve our countermeasure to prevent such incident we may be unable to anticipate every scenario and it is possible that certain cyber threat or vulnerability will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack or an accidental incident on and our customer cyber security attack could require significant expenditure of our capital and diversion of our resource additionally effort by malicious cyber actor or others could cause interruption delay or cessation of our product licensing or modification of our software which could cause to lose existing or potential customer successful cyber security attack involving our product and it infrastructure could also negatively impact the market perception of their effectiveness and adversely affect our reputation relationship with our customer and our financial result any theft accidental loss or misuse of confidential personally identifiable or proprietary information could disrupt our business and result in among other thing unfavorable publicity damage to our reputation loss of our trade secret and of contentsother competitive information difficulty in marketing our product allegation by our customer that we have not performed our contractual obligation litigation by affected party and possible financial obligation for liability and damage related to the theft or misuse of such information well fine and other sanction resulting from any related breach of data privacy regulation such the general data protection regulation any of which could have material adverse effect on our business profitability and financial condition interruption in our operation and service or disruption to the functionality provided by our software could adversely impact our revenue or cause customer to cease doing business with in addition our business would be harmed if any of the event of this nature caused our customer and potential customer to believe our service are unreliable our operation are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity event that could have significant disruptive effect on our operation since the technique used to obtain unauthorized access to system or to otherwise sabotage them change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against target we may be unable to anticipate these technique or to implement adequate preventative measure fluctuation in foreign exchange rate could result in loss we operate global business and our consolidated financial result are reported in dollar however some of the revenue and expense of our foreign subsidiary are denominated in local currency fluctuation in foreign exchange rate against the dollar could result in substantial change in reported revenue and operating result due to the foreign exchange impact of translating these transaction into dollar in the normal course of business we employ various hedging strategy to partially mitigate these risk including the use of derivative instrument these strategy may not be effective in protecting against the effect of fluctuation in foreign exchange rate result fluctuation in foreign exchange rate could result in financial loss risk related to our taxeschanges in tax legislation or policy could materially impact our financial position and result of operation corporate tax reform anti base erosion rule and tax transparency continue to be high priority in many jurisdiction result policy regarding corporate income and other tax in numerous jurisdiction are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation ha been and will likely continue to be proposed or enacted in number of jurisdiction in which we operate after enactment of the tax cut and job act the tax reform act most of our income is taxable in the with significant portion taxable under the global intangible low taxed income gilti regime beginning in fiscal year the deduction allowable under the gilti regime will decrease from to which will increase the effective tax rate imposed on our income if the tax rate increase or the deduction allowable under the gilti regime is further reduced or eliminated or additional limitation are put on our ability to deduct interest expense our provision for income tax net income and cash flow would be adversely impacted in addition many country are implementing legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rule with the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd base erosion and profit shifting recommendation and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy including change to cross border tax transfer pricing documentation rule and nexus based tax incentive practice the oecd is also continuing discussion surrounding fundamental change in allocation of profit among tax jurisdiction in which company do business well the implementation of global minimum tax namely the pillar one and pillar two proposal result of this heightened scrutiny prior decision by tax authority regarding treatment and position of corporate income tax could be subject to enforcement activity and legislative investigation and inquiry which could also result in change in tax policy or prior tax ruling any such change may also result in the tax we previously paid being subject to change further many jurisdiction have passed and may pas additional legislation intended to alleviate the economic burden of covid and to fund economic recovery and growth including various temporary tax incentive or relief and restricted tax measure which could result in future tax increase we can not predict the extent to which the covid pandemic will impact our tax liability and are continuing to evaluate the impact of the new legislation to our financial statement any substantial change in domestic or international corporate tax policy regulation or guidance enforcement activity or legislative initiative may materially adversely affect our business the amount of tax we are required to pay and our financial condition and result of operation generally of contentsif the tax incentive or tax holiday arrangement we have negotiated change or cease to be in effect or applicable for any reason or if our assumption and interpretation regarding tax law and incentive or holiday arrangement prove to be incorrect our corporate income tax could significantly increase our operation are currently structured to benefit from the various tax incentive extended to in various jurisdiction to encourage investment or employment for example absent our principal tax incentive from the singapore economic development board which is scheduled to expire in the corporate income tax rate that would apply to our singapore taxable income would be we also have tax holiday on our qualifying income in malaysia which is scheduled to expire in fiscal year each tax incentive and tax holiday is subject to our compliance with various operating and other condition and may in some instance be amended or terminated prior to their scheduled termination date by the relevant governmental authority if we can not or elect not to comply with the operating condition included in any particular tax incentive or tax holiday we could in some instance be required to refund previously realized material tax benefit or if such tax incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to it expiration absent new incentive applying we will lose the related tax benefit earlier than scheduled in addition we may be required or elect to modify our operational structure and tax strategy in order to keep an incentive which could result in decrease in the benefit of the incentive our tax incentive and tax holiday taking into consideration foreign tax credit decreased the provision for income tax by approximately million in the aggregate and increased diluted net income per share by for fiscal year our interpretation and conclusion regarding the tax incentive are not binding on any taxing authority and if our assumption about tax and other law are incorrect or if these tax incentive are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequence which would increase our expense reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flow our income tax and overall cash tax cost are affected by number of factor that could materially adversely affect financial result significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax in the ordinary course of our business there are many transaction where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain additionally our calculation of income tax payable currently and on deferred basis are based on our interpretation of applicable tax law in the jurisdiction in which we are required to file tax return although we believe our tax estimate are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different than what is reflected in our income tax provision and accrual our income tax are subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by numerous factor including reorganization or restructuring of our business tangible and intangible asset outstanding indebtedness and corporate structure jurisdictional mix of our income and asset change in the allocation of income and expense including adjustment related to change in our corporate structure acquisition or tax law change in and foreign tax law and regulation change to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiary taxation of income generated from foreign source the deductibility of expense attributable to income and foreign tax credit rule tax effect of increase in non deductible employee compensation and change in tax accounting rule or principle and in the valuation of deferred tax asset and liability we have adopted transfer pricing policy that call for the provision of service the sale of product the arrangement of financing and the grant of license from one affiliate to another at price that we believe are negotiated on an arm length basis our taxable income is dependent upon acceptance by local authority that our operational practice and intercompany transfer pricing are on an arm length basis due to inconsistency in application of the arm length standard among taxing authority well lack of comprehensive treaty based protection transfer pricing challenge by tax authority could if successful result in adjustment for prior or future year the effect of any such change could subject to higher tax and our earnings result of operation and cash flow would be adversely affected in addition we are subject to and are under tax audit in various jurisdiction and such jurisdiction may ass additional income tax against although we believe our tax position are reasonable the final determination of tax audit could be materially different from our income tax provision and accrual the ultimate result of an audit could have material adverse effect on our result of operation and cash flow in the period or period for which that determination is made of contentsrisks related to our indebtednessour substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to execute our business strategy of october the aggregate indebtedness under our senior note wa million we expect to maintain significant level of indebtedness going forward our substantial indebtedness could have important consequence including increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry condition exposing to interest rate risk due to our variable rate term facility which we do not typically hedge against limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to change in the economy and the semiconductor industry placing at competitive disadvantage compared to our competitor with le indebtedness making it more difficult to borrow additional fund in the future to fund growth acquisition working capital capital expenditure and other purpose and potentially requiring to dedicate substantial portion of our cash flow from operation to payment on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund our other business need we receive debt rating from the major credit rating agency in the factor that may impact our credit rating include debt level planned asset purchase or sale and near term and long term production growth opportunity liquidity asset quality cost structure reserve mix and commodity pricing level could also be considered by the rating agency while we are focused on maintaining investment grade rating from these agency we may be unable to do so any downgrade in our credit rating or the rating of our indebtedness or adverse condition

limitation on our ability to incur certain secured debt enter into certain sale and lease back transaction and consolidate merge sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our asset in addition the instrument contain customary event of default upon the occurrence of which after any applicable grace period the indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable in such event we may not have sufficient available cash to repay such debt at the time it becomes due or be able to refinance such debt on acceptable term or at all any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation servicing our debt requires significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt our ability to make scheduled payment of the principal of to pay interest on and to refinance our debt depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factor our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operation in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligation under our current indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditure if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternative such reducing or delaying investment or capital expenditure selling asset refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on term that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance our outstanding indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on the capital market and our financial condition at such time we may not be able to engage in any of these activity or engage in these activity on desirable term when needed which could result in default on our indebtedness of contentsrisks related to owning our common stockat time our stock price ha been volatile and it may fluctuate substantially in the future which could result in

annual report on form for fiscal year filed with the security and exchange commission the sec on december overview we are global technology leader that design develops and supply broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solution we develop semiconductor device with focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based device and analog iii based product we have history of innovation in the semiconductor industry and offer thousand of product that are used in end product such enterprise and data center networking home connectivity set top box broadband access telecommunication equipment smartphones and base station data center server and storage system factory automation power generation and alternative energy system and electronic display our infrastructure software solution enable customer to plan develop automate manage and secure application across mainframe distributed mobile and cloud platform our portfolio of industry leading infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize optimize and secure the most complex hybrid environment enabling scalability agility automation insight resiliency and security we also offer mission critical fibre channel storage area networking fc san product and related software in the form of module switch and subsystem incorporating multiple semiconductor product we have two reportable segment semiconductor solution and infrastructure software result of change in our organizational structure during fiscal year our semiconductor solution segment includes all of our product line and intellectual property ip licensing our infrastructure software segment includes our mainframe distributed and cyber security solution and our fc san business during fiscal year we refined our allocation methodology for certain selling general and administrative expense to more closely align these cost with the segment benefiting from the shared expense our strategy is to combine best of breed technology leadership in semiconductor and infrastructure software solution with unmatched scale on common sale and administrative platform to deliver comprehensive suite of infrastructure technology product to the world leading business and government customer we seek to achieve this through responsibly financed acquisition of category leading business and technology well investing extensively in research and development to ensure our product retain their technology leadership this strategy result in robust business model designed to drive diversified and sustainable operating and financial result the demand for our product ha been affected in the past and is likely to continue to be affected in the future by various factor including the following gain or loss of significant customer general economic and market condition in the industry and market in which we compete our distributor product inventory and end customer demand the rate at which our present and future customer and end user adopt our product and technology in our target market and the rate at which our customer product that include our technology are accepted in their market the shift to cloud based information technology solution and service such hyperscale computing which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sale of our product for use in traditional enterprise data center and the timing rescheduling or cancellation of expected customer order covid updatein response to the ongoing covid pandemic and the various resulting government directive we have taken extensive measure to protect the health and safety of our employee and contractor at our facility we modified our workplace practice globally which resulted in some of our employee working remotely for an extended period of time and some of are still working remotely while we have implemented personal safety measure at all of our facility where of contentsour employee are working on site we may need to modify our business practice and policy we continue to monitor the implication of the covid pandemic on our business well our customer and supplier business the demand environment for our semiconductor product wa consistent with our expectation for the fourth quarter of fiscal year with continued demand for product and infrastructure customer invest in technology to support remote or hybrid tele work and learning arising from covid well the transition to office re opening while we continue to see robust demand in this area and record profitability driven by the supply imbalance the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and it may not be sustainable over the longer term we continue to experience various constraint in our supply chain due to the pandemic including with respect to wafer and substrate while supply lead time have stabilized we continue to have difficulty in obtaining some necessary component and input in timely manner to meet increased demand to date the impact of covid on the demand environment for our software product ha been limited we have also taken various action to de risk our business in light of the ongoing uncertainty and strengthen our balance sheet including closely managing working capital and our debt instrument overall in light of the changing nature and continuing uncertainty around the covid pandemic our ability to predict the impact of covid on our business in future period remains limited the effect of the pandemic on our business are unlikely to be fully realized or reflected in our financial result until future period

annual report on form acquisition of ca inc on november we acquired ca inc ca for billion in aggregate cash purchase consideration and assumed billion of outstanding unsecured bond we financed the acquisition of ca with billion of term loan well cash on hand of the combined company we also assumed all eligible unvested ca equity award in the transaction on december we sold veracode inc subsidiary of ca and provider of application security testing solution to thoma bravo llc for cash consideration of million before working capital adjustment net revenuea majority of our net revenue is derived from sale of broad range of semiconductor device that are incorporated into electronic product well from module switch and subsystem net revenue is also generated from the sale of software solution that enable our customer to plan develop automate manage and secure application across mainframe distributed mobile and cloud platform our overall net revenue well the percentage of total net revenue generated by sale in our semiconductor solution and infrastructure software segment have varied from quarter to quarter due largely to fluctuation in end market demand including the effect of seasonality which are discussed in detail in part item business under seasonality of this annual report on form original equipment manufacturer oems or their contract manufacturer and distributor typically account for the substantial majority of our semiconductor sale to serve customer around the world we have strategically developed relationship with large global electronic component distributor complemented by number of regional distributor with customer relationship based on their respective product range we have established strong relationship with leading oem customer across multiple target market our direct sale force focus on supporting our large oem customer and ha specialized product and service knowledge that enables to sell specific offering at key level throughout customer organization certain customer require to contract with them directly and with specified intermediary such contract of contentsmanufacturers many of our major customer relationship have been in place for many year and are often the result of year of collaborative product development this ha enabled to build our extensive ip portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our customer requirement including substantial system level knowledge this collaboration ha provided with key insight into our customer business and ha enabled to be more efficient and productive and to better serve our target market and customer we recognize revenue upon the delivery of our product to the distributor which can cause our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly such revenue is reduced for estimated return and distributor allowance our software customer generally consist of large enterprise that have computing environment from multiple vendor and are highly complex we believe our enterprise wide license model will continue to offer our customer reduced complexity more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth cost and expensescost of product sold cost of product sold consists primarily of the cost for semiconductor wafer and other material well the cost of assembling and testing those product and material such cost include personnel and overhead related to our manufacturing operation which include stock based compensation expense related occupancy computer service equipment cost manufacturing quality order fulfillment warranty adjustment inventory adjustment including write down for inventory obsolescence and acquisition cost which include direct transaction cost and acquisition related cost although we outsource significant portion of our manufacturing activity we do have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facility if we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facility at desired level the fixed cost associated with these facility will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit cost and lower gross margin cost of subscription and service cost of subscription and service consists of personnel project cost associated with professional service or support of our subscription and service revenue and allocated facility cost and other corporate expense personnel cost include stock based compensation expense total cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquisition related intangible asset and restructuring charge research and development research and development expense consists primarily of personnel cost for our engineer engaged in the design and development of our product and technology including stock based compensation expense these expense also include project material cost third party fee paid to consultant prototype development expense allocated facility cost and other corporate expense and computer service cost related to supporting computer tool used in the engineering and design process selling general and administrative selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated cost for sale and marketing personnel

finance human resource and other administrative personnel including stock based compensation expense outside professional fee allocated facility cost acquisition related cost and other corporate expense amortization of acquisition related intangible asset in connection with our acquisition we recognize intangible asset that are being amortized over their estimated useful life we also recognize goodwill which is not amortized and in process research and development ipr which is initially capitalized an indefinite lived intangible asset in connection with the acquisition upon completion of each underlying project ipr asset are reclassified amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized over their estimated useful life restructuring impairment and disposal charge restructuring impairment and disposal charge consist primarily of compensation cost associated with employee exit program alignment of our global manufacturing operation rationalizing product development program cost facility and lease abandonment fixed asset impairment ipr impairment and other exit cost including curtailment of service or supply agreement interest expense interest expense includes coupon interest commitment fee accretion of original issue discount amortization of debt premium and debt issuance cost and expense related to debt modification or extinguishments other income net other income net includes interest income gain or loss on investment foreign currency remeasurement and other miscellaneous item provision for benefit from income tax we have structured our operation to maximize the benefit from tax incentive extended to in various jurisdiction to encourage investment or employment our tax incentive from the singapore economic development board provide that any qualifying income earned in singapore is subject to tax incentive or reduced rate of singapore income tax subject to our compliance with the condition specified in these incentive and of contentslegislative development these singapore tax incentive are presently expected to expire in november the corporate income tax rate in singapore that would otherwise apply to would be we also have tax holiday on our qualifying income in malaysia which is scheduled to expire in fiscal year each tax incentive and tax holiday is also subject to our compliance with various operating and other condition if we can not or elect not to comply with any such operating condition specified we could in some instance be required to refund previously realized material tax benefit or if such tax incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to it expiration absent new incentive applying we will lose the related tax benefit earlier than scheduled we may elect to modify our operational structure and tax strategy which may not be beneficial to the benefit provided under the present tax concession arrangement before taking into consideration the effect of the tax cut and job act and other indirect tax impact the effect of these tax incentive and tax holiday wa to decrease the provision for income tax by approximately million for fiscal year and increase the benefit from income tax by approximately million for fiscal year our interpretation and conclusion regarding the tax incentive are not binding on any taxing authority and if our assumption about tax and other law are incorrect or if these tax incentive are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequence which would increase our expense reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flow in addition taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practice and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authority being on an arm length basis due to inconsistency in application of the arm length standard among taxing authority well lack of adequate treaty based protection transfer pricing challenge by tax authority could if successful substantially increase our income tax expense critical accounting estimatesthe preparation of financial statement in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle in the united state gaap requires to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability and disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period we base our estimate and assumption on current fact historical experience and various other factor that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability and the accrual of cost and expense that are not readily apparent from other source our actual financial result may differ materially and adversely from our estimate our critical accounting policy are those that affect our historical financial statement materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgment by management those policy include revenue recognition business combination valuation of goodwill and long lived asset inventory valuation income tax retirement and post retirement benefit plan assumption stock based compensation and employee bonus program see note summary of significant accounting policy included in part ii item of this annual report on form for further information on our critical accounting policy and estimate revenue recognition we account for contract with customer when both party have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligation each party right can be identified payment term can be identified the contract ha commercial substance and it is probable we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to revenue is recognized when or performance obligation are satisfied by transferring control of promised product or service to customer our product and service can be broadly categorized sale of product and subscription and service we recognize product revenue from sale to direct customer and distributor when control transfer to the customer an allowance for distributor credit covering price adjustment is made based on our estimate of historical experience rate well considering economic condition and contractual term to date actual distributor claim activity ha been materially consistent with the provision we have made based on our historical estimate however because of the inherent nature of estimate there is always risk that there could be significant difference between actual amount and our estimate different judgment or estimate could result in variance that might be significant to reported operating result we also record reduction of revenue for rebate in the same period that the related revenue is recorded we accrue of potential rebate at the time of sale we reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amount specific rebate program contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebate are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid thus the reversal of unclaimed rebate may have positive impact on our net revenue and net income in subsequent period our contract may contain more than one of our product and service each of which is separately accounted for distinct performance obligation when available we use directly observable transaction to determine the standalone selling price for performance obligation our estimate of standalone selling price for each performance obligation require judgment that considers multiple factor including not limited to historical discounting trend for product and service and pricing practice through different sale channel gross margin objective internal cost competitor pricing strategy technology lifecycles and market condition of contentswe also estimate the standalone selling price of our material right our estimate of the value of the customer option to purchase or receive additional product or service at discounted price includes estimating the incremental discount the customer would obtain when exercising the option and the likelihood that the option would be exercised certain contract contain right of return that allows the customer to cancel all or portion of the product or service and receive credit we estimate return based on historical return data which is constrained to an amount for which material revenue reversal is not probable we do not recognize revenue for product or service that are expected to be returned business combination accounting for business combination requires management to make significant estimate and assumption especially at the acquisition date for intangible asset contractual obligation assumed restructuring liability pre acquisition contingency and contingent consideration where applicable although we believe the assumption and estimate we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain critical estimate in valuing certain of the intangible asset we have acquired include but are not limited to future expected cash flow from product sale customer contract and acquired technology revenue growth rate customer ramp up period technology obsolescence rate expected cost to develop ipr into commercially viable product estimated cash flow from the project when completed and discount rate the discount rate used to discount expected future cash flow to present value are typically derived from weighted average cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risk unanticipated event and circumstance may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumption estimate or actual result valuation of goodwill and long lived asset we perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year and more frequently if we believe indicator of impairment exist the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment to review for impairment we first ass qualitative factor to determine whether event or circumstance lead to determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting unit is le than it carrying amount our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill whether performed annually or based on specific event or circumstance considers various macroeconomic industry specific and company specific factor these factor include severe adverse industry or economic trend ii significant company specific action including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operation iii current historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance or iv sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value after assessing the totality of event and circumstance if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting unit is le than it carrying amount no further assessment is performed if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting unit is le than it carrying amount we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit net book value determining the fair value of reporting unit involves the use of significant estimate and assumption our goodwill impairment test us both the income approach and the market approach to estimate reporting unit fair value the income approach is based on the discounted cash flow method that us the reporting unit estimate for forecasted future financial performance including revenue operating expense and tax well working capital and capital asset requirement these estimate are developed part of our long term planning process based on assumed market segment growth rate and our assumed market segment share estimated cost based on historical data and various internal estimate projected cash flow are then discounted to present value employing discount rate that properly account for the estimated market weighted average cost of capital well any risk unique to the subject cash flow the market approach is based on weighting financial multiple of comparable company and applies control premium reporting unit carrying value represents the assignment of various asset and liability excluding certain corporate asset and liability such cash and debt we ass the impairment of long lived asset including purchased ipr property plant and equipment and intangible asset whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable factor we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating result ii significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business or iii significant negative industry or economic trend the process of evaluating the potential impairment of long lived asset under the accounting guidance on property plant and equipment and other intangible asset is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment in order to estimate the fair value of long lived asset we typically make various assumption about the future prospect of our business or the part of our business that the long lived asset relates to we also consider market factor specific to the business and estimate future cash flow to be generated by the business which requires significant judgment it is based on assumption about market demand for our product over number of future year based on these assumption and estimate we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the long lived asset stated on our consolidated balance sheet of contentsto reflect it estimated fair value assumption and estimate about future value and remaining useful life are complex and often subjective they can be affected by variety of factor including external factor such the real estate market industry and economic trend and internal factor such change in our business strategy and our internal forecast although we believe the assumption and estimate we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate change in assumption and estimate could materially impact our reported financial result inventory valuation we regularly review inventory quantity on hand and record provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirement demand for our product can fluctuate significantly from period to period significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantity on hand in addition our industry is characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantity on hand additionally our estimate of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate which may cause to understate or overstate both the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory and cost of product sold therefore although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecast of future product demand any significant unanticipated change in demand or technological development could have significant impact on the value of our inventory and our result of operation income tax significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for or benefit from income tax including the determination of deferred tax asset and liability and any valuation allowance that might be required against the deferred tax asset we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategy in assessing the need for valuation allowance an adjustment to the valuation allowance will either increase or decrease our provision for or benefit from income tax in the period such determination is made in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing position we accrue an income tax liability when such position do not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition the calculation of our tax liability involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax law and regulation in multitude of jurisdiction we recognize potential liability for anticipated tax audit issue in the and other tax jurisdiction based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax interest and penalty will be due if our estimate of income tax liability prof to be le than the actual amount ultimately assessed further charge to tax expense would be required if the payment of these amount ultimately prof to be unnecessary the reversal of the accrued liability would result in tax benefit being recognized in the period when we determine the liability no longer exist retirement and post retirement benefit plan assumption retirement and post retirement benefit plan obligation represent liability that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future retirement and post retirement benefit plan cost over the employee average expected future service to based on the term of the plan and investment and funding decision to estimate the impact of these future payment and our decision concerning funding of these obligation we are required to make assumption using actuarial concept within the framework of gaap one assumption is the discount rate used to calculate the estimated plan obligation other assumption include the expected long term return on plan asset expected future salary increase the health care cost trend rate expected future increase to benefit payment expected retirement date employee turnover retiree mortality rate and portfolio composition we evaluate these assumption at least annually for our and non plan we use october the month end closest to our fiscal year end the annual discount rate measurement date to determine the present value of future benefit payment the discount rate are based on the result of matching expected plan benefit payment with cash flow from hypothetical yield curve constructed with

yield depending on the availability of sufficient quantity of quality corporate bond lower discount rate increase present value of the pension liability and subsequent year pension expense higher

derivative financial instrument for speculative or trading purpose outstanding derivative are recognized either asset or liability at their fair value based on level input defined in the fair value hierarchy the accounting for gain and loss resulting from change in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and it hedging designation for derivative instrument designated fair value hedge the change in fair value are recognized in other income net in the period of change and are offset by the change in fair value of the hedged item for derivative instrument designated cash flow hedge the change in fair value of the effective portion are initially recognized in other comprehensive income loss net of tax in the period of change and are subsequently reclassified and recognized in the same line item the hedged item when either the hedged transaction affect earnings or it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur the change in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the derivative instrument are recognized in other income net in the period of change which have not been material to date for derivative instrument not designated hedge the change in fair value are recognized in other income net in the period of change we did not have any outstanding derivative instrument of october or november of contentsproperty plant and equipment property plant and equipment are stated at cost le accumulated depreciation and amortization addition improvement and major renewal are capitalized and maintenance repair and minor renewal are expensed incurred asset are held in construction in progress until placed in service upon which date we begin to depreciate these asset when asset are retired or disposed of the asset and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from our property plant and equipment balance and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operation building and leasehold improvement are generally depreciated over to year or over the lease period whichever is shorter and machinery and equipment are generally depreciated over to year we use the straight line method of depreciation for all property plant and equipment lease we determine if an arrangement is lease or contains lease at the inception of the arrangement and evaluate whether the lease is an operating lease or finance lease at the commencement date we recognize right of use rou asset and lease liability for operating and finance lease with term greater than month and account for the lease and non lease component single component rou asset represent our right to use an asset for the lease term while lease liability represent our obligation to make lease payment operating and finance lease rou asset and liability are recognized based on the present value of lease payment over the lease term at the lease commencement date we use the implicit interest rate or if not readily determinable our incremental borrowing rate of the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payment the incremental borrowing rate is based on our unsecured borrowing rate adjusted for the effect of collateral operating and finance lease rou asset are recognized net of any lease prepayment and incentive lease term may include option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option operating lease expense is recognized on straight line basis over the lease term finance lease expense is recognized based on the effective interest method over the lease term fair value measurement fair value is defined the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date three level hierarchy is applied to prioritize the input to valuation technique used to measure fair value the hierarchy give the highest priority to unadjusted quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable input level measurement the three level of the fair value hierarchy under the guidance for fair value measurement are described below level level input are quoted price unadjusted in active market for identical asset or liability that the reporting entity ha the ability to access at the measurement date our level asset include cash equivalent banker acceptance trading security investment and investment fund we measure trading security investment and investment fund at quoted market price they are traded in active market with sufficient volume and frequency of transaction level level input are input other than quoted price included within level that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly if the asset or liability ha specified contractual term level input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability level level input are unobservable input for the asset or liability in which there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date level asset and liability include investment in equity security without readily determinable fair value goodwill intangible asset and property plant and equipment which are measured at fair value using discounted cash flow approach when they are impaired quantitative information for level asset and liability reviewed at each reporting period includes indicator of significant deterioration in the earnings performance credit rating asset quality business prospect of the investee and financial indicator of the investee ability to continue going concern of contentsbusiness combination we account for business combination under the acquisition method of accounting which requires to recognize separately from goodwill the asset acquired and the liability assumed at their acquisition date fair value while we use our best estimate and assumption to accurately value asset acquired and liability assumed at the acquisition date well contingent consideration where applicable our estimate are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustment to the asset acquired and liability assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the value of asset acquired or liability assumed whichever come first any subsequent adjustment are recognized in our consolidated statement of operation accounting for business combination requires our management to make significant estimate and assumption especially at the acquisition date including our estimate for intangible asset contractual obligation assumed restructuring liability pre acquisition contingency and contingent consideration where applicable although we believe the assumption and estimate we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain critical estimate in valuing certain acquired intangible asset under the income approach include growth in future expected cash flow from product sale customer contract and acquired technology revenue growth rate customer ramp up period technology obsolescence rate expected cost to develop in process research and development ipr into commercially viable product estimated cash flow from the project when completed and discount rate unanticipated event and circumstance may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumption estimate or actual result goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related cost over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible asset of business acquired goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicator arise for impairment to review for impairment we first ass qualitative factor to determine whether event or circumstance lead to determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting unit is le than it carrying amount our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill whether performed annually or based on specific event or circumstance considers various macroeconomic industry specific and company specific factor those factor include severe adverse industry or economic trend ii significant company specific action including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operation iii current historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance or iv sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value after assessing the totality of event and circumstance if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting unit is le than it carrying amount no further assessment is performed if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting unit is le than it carrying amount we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit net book value if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than it net book value there is no impairment otherwise we calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible asset excluding goodwill of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is le than the carrying value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference determining the fair value of reporting unit involves the use of significant estimate and assumption long lived asset purchased finite lived intangible asset are carried at cost le accumulated amortization amortization is recognized over the period during which the intangible asset are expected to contribute to our cash flow purchased ipr project are capitalized at fair value an indefinite lived intangible asset and assessed for impairment thereafter upon completion of each underlying project ipr asset are reclassified amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized over their estimated useful life if an ipr project is abandoned we recognize the carrying value of the related intangible asset in our consolidated statement of operation in the period it is abandoned on quarterly basis we monitor factor and change in circumstance that could indicate carrying amount of long lived asset including purchased intangible asset and property plant and equipment may not be recoverable factor we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating result ii significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business and iii significant negative industry or economic trend an impairment loss must be measured if the sum of the expected future cash flow undiscounted and before interest from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group is le than the net book value of the asset or asset group the amount of the impairment loss will generally be measured the difference between the net book value of the asset or asset group and the estimated fair value warranty we accrue for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time revenue is recognized product warranty cost are estimated based upon our historical experience and specific identification of the product requirement which may fluctuate based on product mix additionally we accrue for warranty cost associated with occasional or unanticipated product quality issue if loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated of contentsrevenue recognition we account for contract with customer when both party have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligation each party right can be identified payment term can be identified the contract ha commercial substance and it is probable we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to revenue is recognized when or performance obligation are satisfied by transferring control of promised product or service to customer nature of product and servicesour product and service can be broadly categorized sale of product and subscription and service the following is description of the principal activity from which we generate revenue product we recognize revenue from sale to direct customer and distributor when control transfer to the customer rebate and incentive offered to distributor which are earned when sale to end customer are completed are estimated at the point of revenue recognition we have elected to exclude from the transaction price any tax collected from customer and to account for shipping and handling activity performed after customer obtains control of the product activity to fulfill the promise to transfer the product from time to time certain customer agree to pay secure supply fee in exchange for prioritized fulfillment of product order such fee are included in the transaction price of the product order and are recognized revenue in the period that control over the product is transferred to the customer subscription and service our subscription and service revenue consists of sale and royalty from software arrangement support service professional service transfer of ip and non recurring engineering nre arrangement revenue from software arrangement primarily consists of fee which may be paid either at contract inception or in installment over the contract term that provide customer with right to use the software access general support and maintenance and utilize our professional service our software license have standalone functionality from which customer derive benefit and the customer obtains control of the software when it is delivered or made available for download we believe that for the majority of software arrangement customer derive significant benefit from the ongoing support we provide the majority of our subscription and service arrangement permit our customer to unilaterally terminate or cancel these arrangement at any time at the customer convenience referred to termination for convenience provision without substantive termination penalty and receive pro rata refund of any prepaid fee accordingly we account for arrangement with these termination for convenience provision series of daily contract resulting in ratable revenue recognition of software revenue over the contractual period support service consist primarily of telephone support and the provision of unspecified update and upgrade on when and if available basis support service represent stand ready obligation for which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement professional service consist of implementation consulting customer education and customer training service the obligation to provide professional service is generally satisfied over time with the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefit we satisfy our performance obligation right to our ip are either sold or licensed to customer ip revenue recognition is dependent on the nature and term of each agreement we recognize ip revenue upon delivery of the ip if there are no substantive future obligation to perform under the arrangement sale based or usage based royalty from the license of ip are recognized at the later of the period the sale or usage occur or the satisfaction of the performance obligation to which some or all of the sale based or usage based royalty have been allocated there are two main category of nre contract that we enter into with our customer nre contract in which we develop custom chip and nre contract in which we accelerate our development of new chip upon the customer request the majority of our nre contract revenue meet the over time criterion such revenue is recognized over the development period with the measure of progress using the input method based on cost incurred to total cost cost to cost the service are provided for nre contract that do not meet the over time criterion revenue is recognized at point in time when the nre service are complete material right contract with customer may also include material right that are also performance obligation these include the right to renew or receive product or service at discounted price in the future revenue allocated to material right is recognized when the customer exercise the right or the right expires arrangement with multiple performance obligationsour contract may contain more than one of the product and service listed above each of which is separately accounted for distinct performance obligation of contentsallocation of consideration we allocate total contract consideration to each distinct performance obligation in bundled arrangement on relative standalone selling price basis the standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstance and to similar customer standalone selling price when available we use directly observable transaction to determine the standalone selling price for performance obligation our estimate of standalone selling price for each performance obligation require judgment that considers multiple factor including but not limited to historical discounting trend for product and service and pricing practice through different sale channel gross margin objective internal cost competitor pricing strategy technology lifecycles and market condition we separately determine the standalone selling price by product or service type additionally we segment the standalone selling price for product where the pricing strategy differ and where there are difference in customer and circumstance that warrant segmentation we also estimate the standalone selling price of our material right lastly we estimate the value of the customer option to purchase or receive additional product or service at discounted price by estimating the incremental discount the customer would obtain when exercising the option and the likelihood that the option would be exercised other policy and judgmentscontract modification we may modify contract to offer customer additional product or service each of the additional product and service is generally considered distinct from those product or service transferred to the customer before the modification we evaluate whether the contract price for the additional product and service reflects the standalone selling price adjusted for fact and circumstance applicable to that contract in these case we account for the additional product or service separate contract in other case where the pricing in the modification doe not reflect the standalone selling price adjusted for fact and circumstance applicable to that contract we account for the additional product or service part of the existing contract on prospective basis on cumulative catch up basis or combination of both based on the nature of the modification in instance where the pricing in the modification offer the customer credit for prior arrangement we adjust our variable consideration reserve for return and other concession right of return certain contract contain right of return that allows the customer to cancel all or portion of the product or service and receive credit we estimate return based on historical return data which is constrained to an amount for which material revenue reversal is not probable we do not recognize revenue for product or service that are expected to be returned practical expedient elected we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligation for contract with an original expected length of one year or le and ii contract for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for service performed for contract that were modified before the beginning of the earliest reporting period presented we have not retrospectively restated the contract for those modification we have disclosed the aggregate effect of all modification when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligation for purpose of determining the transaction price and allocating the transaction price at transition research and development research and development expense consists primarily of personnel cost for our engineer and third party engaged in the design and development of our product software and technology including salary bonus and stock based compensation expense project material cost service and depreciation such cost are charged to research and development expense they are incurred stock based compensation expense we recognize compensation expense for time based restricted stock unit rsus using the straight line amortization method based on the fair value of rsus on the date of grant the fair value of rsus is the closing market price of broadcom common stock on the date of grant reduced by the present value of dividend expected to be paid on broadcom common stock prior to vesting we recognize compensation expense for time based stock option and employee stock purchase plan right under the broadcom inc employee stock purchase plan amended espp based on the estimated grant date fair value determined using the black scholes valuation model with straight line amortization method certain equity award include both service and market condition the fair value of market based award is estimated on the date of grant using the monte carlo simulation technique compensation expense for market based award is amortized based upon graded vesting method over the service period we estimate forfeiture expected to occur and recognize stock based compensation expense for such award expected to vest change in the estimated forfeiture rate can have significant effect on stock based compensation expense since the effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed of contentsshipping and handling cost our shipping and handling cost charged to customer are included in net revenue and the associated expense is included in cost of revenue for all period presented litigation and settlement cost we are involved in legal action and other matter arising in our recent business acquisition and in the normal course of business we recognize an estimated loss contingency when the outcome is probable prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statement and we are able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any possible loss income tax we account for income tax under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax asset and liability for the expected future tax consequence of event that have been included in the consolidated financial statement under this method deferred tax asset and liability are determined based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement and tax basis of asset and liability using enacted tax rate in effect for the year in which the difference are expected to reverse the effect of change in tax rate on deferred tax asset and liability is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date we recognize net deferred tax asset to the extent we believe these asset will more likely than not be realized in making such determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liability projected future taxable income tax planning strategy and recent financial operation if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred income tax asset in the future in excess of their net carrying value we adjust the valuation allowance and reduce the provision for income tax or increase the benefit from income tax likewise if we determine that we are not able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset we increase the provision for income tax or decrease the benefit from income tax in the period such determination is made we account for uncertainty in income tax in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on income tax this guidance provides that tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeal or litigation process based on the technical merit net income per share basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock by the weighted average number of share of common stock outstanding during the period diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock by the weighted average number of share of common stock and potentially dilutive share of common stock outstanding during the period diluted share outstanding include the dilutive effect of unvested rsus in the money stock option and espp right together referred to equity award well convertible preferred stock potentially dilutive share whose effect would have been antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share the dilutive effect of equity award is calculated based on the average stock price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method under the treasury stock method the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock option and purchasing share under the espp and the amount of compensation cost for future service that we have not yet recognized are collectively assumed to be used to repurchase share the dilutive effect of convertible preferred stock is calculated using the if converted method the if converted method assumes that these security were converted at the beginning of the reporting period to the extent that the effect is dilutive recent accounting guidance not yet adoptedin october the financial accounting standard board issued accounting standard update asu business combination topic accounting for contract asset and contract liability from contract with customer the new guidance requires contract asset and contract liability acquired in business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with accounting standard codification revenue from contract with customer if it had originated the contract this approach differs from the current requirement to measure contract asset and contract liability acquired in business combination at fair value the new guidance will be effective for the first quarter of our fiscal year ending october with early adoption permitted the adoption impact of the new standard will depend on the magnitude of future acquisition the standard will not impact acquired contract asset or liability from business combination occurring prior to the adoption date revenue from contract with customer

and it expense shared expense are primarily allocated based on revenue and headcount during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year we refined our allocation methodology for certain selling general and administrative expense to more closely align these cost with the segment benefiting from the shared expense prior period segment result have been recast to conform to the current presentation unallocated expensesunallocated expense include amortization of acquisition related intangible asset stock based compensation expense restructuring impairment and disposal charge acquisition related

based on the physical location of the asset october in million long lived asset united state total long lived asset significant customer informationwe sell our product through our direct sale force

contractual obligation and commitment of october fiscal year purchase commitmentsother contractual commitment in million thereafter total purchase commitment represents unconditional purchase obligation that include agreement to purchase good or service primarily inventory that are enforceable and legally binding on and that specify all significant term including fixed or minimum quantity to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provision and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligation exclude agreement that are cancelable without penalty other contractual commitment represents amount payable pursuant to agreement related to it human resource and other service agreement due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflow associated with our unrecognized tax benefit at october we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore million of unrecognized tax benefit and accrued interest and penalty classified within other long term liability on our consolidated balance sheet of october have been excluded from the table above contingenciesfrom time to time we are involved in litigation that we believe is of the type common to company engaged in our line of business including commercial dispute employment issue tax dispute and dispute involving claim by third party that our activity infringe their patent copyright trademark or other ip right well regulatory investigation or of contentsinquiries legal proceeding and regulatory investigation or inquiry are often complex may require the expenditure of significant fund and other resource and the outcome of such proceeding is inherently uncertain with material adverse outcome possible ip property claim generally involve the demand by third party that we cease the manufacture use or sale of the allegedly infringing product process or technology and or pay substantial damage or royalty for past present and future use of the allegedly infringing ip claim that our product or process infringe or misappropriate any third party ip right including claim arising through our contractual indemnification of our customer often involve highly complex technical issue the outcome of which is inherently uncertain moreover from time to time we pursue litigation to assert our ip right regardless of the merit or resolution of any such litigation complex ip litigation is generally costly and diverts the effort and attention of our management and technical personnel lawsuit relating to california institute of technologycalifornia institute of technology caltech filed complaint against broadcom and apple inc on may in the united state district court for the central district of california the central district court and an amended complaint adding cypress semiconductor corporation defendant on august the amended complaint alleged that chip that support certain error correction code specified in ieee standard and willfully infringed four patent related to error correction coding patent no and patent prior to trial caltech dismissed it claim against cypress and withdrew it infringement allegation to patent the complaint sought preliminary and permanent injunction damage pre and post judgment interest well attorney fee cost and expense the trial wa held in january and on january the jury issued it verdict finding infringement and awarding caltech past damage of million from broadcom and million from apple for which apple is seeking indemnification from broadcom on august the central district court issued it judgment awarding caltech past damage in the amount awarded by the jury well pre and post judgment interest additionally the central district court awarded caltech an unspecified amount of ongoing royalty to be determined after the anticipated appeal process is resolved neither the jury nor the central district court found willful infringement which if it had could have resulted in enhanced damage up to three time the amount awarded broadcom and apple have appealed to the united state court of appeal for the federal circuit the federal circuit court and oral argument were heard on september we are unable to predict the date on which the federal circuit court will issue it decision we believe that the evidence and the law do not support the central district court finding of infringement or the award of damage including ongoing royalty and do not believe material loss is probable at this time we believe that there are strong ground for appeal and we intend to vigorously challenge the central district court judgment and ruling result we have not recorded reserve with respect to this litigation in accordance with the applicable accounting standard we believe the low end of the possible range of loss is zero but we can not reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome number of factor including the appeal by broadcom and apple could significantly change the assessment of damage other mattersin addition to the matter discussed above we are currently engaged in number of legal action in the ordinary course of our business contingency assessmentwe do not believe based on currently available fact and circumstance that the final outcome of any pending legal proceeding or ongoing regulatory investigation taken individually or whole will have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statement however lawsuit may involve complex question of fact and law and may require the expenditure of significant fund and other resource to defend the result of litigation or regulatory investigation are inherently uncertain and material adverse outcome are possible from time to time we may enter into confidential discussion regarding the potential settlement of such lawsuit any settlement of pending litigation could require to incur substantial cost and other ongoing expense such future royalty payment in the case of an ip dispute during the period presented no material amount have been accrued or disclosed in the accompanying consolidated financial statement with respect to loss contingency associated with any other legal proceeding or regulatory investigation potential loss for such matter are not considered probable and range of loss are not reasonably estimable these matter are subject to many uncertainty and the ultimate outcome are not predictable there can be no assurance that the actual amount required to satisfy any liability arising from the matter described above will not have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statement of contentsother indemnificationsas is customary in our industry and provided for in local law in the and other jurisdiction many of our standard contract provide remedy to our customer and others with whom we enter into contract such defense settlement or payment of judgment for ip claim related to the use of our product from time to time we indemnify customer well our supplier contractor lessor lessee company that purchase our business or asset and others with whom we enter into contract against combination of loss expense or liability arising from various triggering event related to the sale and the use of our product the use of their good and service the use of facility and state of our owned facility the state of the asset and business that we sell and other matter covered by such contract usually up to specified maximum amount in addition from time to time we also provide protection to these party against claim related to undiscovered liability additional product liability or environmental obligation in our experience claim made under such indemnification are rare and
