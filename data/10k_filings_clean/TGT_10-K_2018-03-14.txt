competitive and reputational risksour continued success is dependent on positive perception of target which if eroded could adversely affect our business and our relationship with our guest and team member we believe that one of the reason our guest prefer to shop at target our team member choose target place of employment and our vendor choose to business with is the reputation we have built many year for serving our four primary constituency guest team member shareholder and the community in which we operate to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve target reputation reputational value is based in large part on perception and broad access to social medium make it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that influence perception of target it may be difficult to control negative publicity regardless of whether it is accurate reputation may take decade to build any negative incident can quickly erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in negative mainstream and social medium publicity consumer boycott governmental investigation or litigation in addition vendor and others with we choose to do business may affect our reputation for example cv operates clinic and pharmacy within our store and our guest perception of and experience with cv may affect our reputation negative reputational incident could adversely affect our business through lost sale loss of new store and technology development opportunity or team member retention and recruiting difficulty if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailer our result of operation could be adversely affected in the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guest shopping experience through careful combination of price merchandise assortment store environment convenience guest service loyalty program and marketing effort our ability to create personalized guest experience through the collection and use of accurate and relevant guest data is important to our ability to differentiate from other retailer guest perception regarding the cleanliness and safety of our store the functionality reliability and speed of our digital channel and fulfillment option our in stock level the effectiveness of our promotion the attractiveness of our third party offering such the clinic and pharmacy owned and operated by cv and other factor also affect our ability to compete no single competitive factor is dominant and action by our competitor on any of factor or the failure of our strategy could adversely affect our sale gross margin and expense we sell many product under our owned and exclusive brand which help differentiate from other retailer generally carry higher margin than equivalent national brand product and represent significant portion of our overall sale if we are unable to successfully develop support and evolve our owned and exclusive brand if one or more of these brand experience loss of consumer acceptance or confidence or if we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property right in these brand our sale and gross margin could be adversely affected the continuing migration of retailing to digital channel ha increased our challenge in differentiating ourselves from other retailer in particular consumer are able to quickly and conveniently comparison shop and determine real time product availability using digital tool which can lead to decision based solely on price the functionality of the digital tool or combination of factor we must compete by offering consistent convenient shopping experience and value for our guest regardless of sale channel and by providing our guest and team member with reliable effective and easy to use digital tool any difficulty in executing our differentiation effort action by our competitor in response to these effort or failure by vendor in managing their channel content and technology system could hurt our ability to differentiate ourselves from other retailer and adversely affect our sale gross margin and expense if we are unable to successfully provide relevant and reliable experience for our guest regardless of where our guest demand is ultimately fulfilled our sale result of operation and reputation could be adversely affected our business ha evolved from an in store experience to interaction with guest across multiple channel in store online mobile and social medium among others our guest are using variety of electronic device and platform to in our store and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspect of our business we must anticipate and meet changing guest expectation and counteract new development and technology investment by our competitor our evolving retailing effort include implementing new technology software and process to be able to cost effectively fulfill guest order directly from our vendor and from any point within our system of store and distribution center providing flexible fulfillment option is complex and may not meet guest expectation for accurate order fulfillment faster and guaranteed delivery time and low price or free shipping if we are unable to attract and retain team member contract with third party or make selective acquisition to obtain the specialized skill needed to support these effort collect accurate relevant and usable guest data to support our personalization effort allow real time and accurate visibility to product availability guest are ready to purchase quickly and efficiently fulfill order using the fulfillment and payment method guest demand or provide convenient and consistent experience for our guest across all sale channel our ability to compete and our result of operation could be adversely affected in addition if target com and our other technology system do not appeal to our guest integrate with our vendor or other third party reliably function designed integrate across all sale channel or maintain the privacy of data we may experience loss of guest confidence and lost sale which could adversely affect our reputation and result of operation if we do not anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preference our sale gross margin and profitability could suffer large part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend right decision and effectively manage our inventory in broad range of merchandise category including apparel accessory home décor electronics toy seasonal offering food and other merchandise if we do not obtain accurate and relevant data on guest preference predict changing consumer taste preference spending pattern and other lifestyle decision emphasize the correct category implement competitive and effective pricing and promotion strategy or personalize our offering to our guest we may experience lost sale spoilage and increased inventory markdowns which would adversely affect our result of operation by reducing our gross margin and hurting our profitability investment and infrastructure risksif our capital investment in remodeling existing store building new store and improving technology and supply chain infrastructure do not achieve appropriate return our competitive position financial condition and result of operation may be adversely affected our business depends in part on our ability to remodel existing store and build new store in manner that achieves appropriate return on our capital investment our current store remodel program is larger than historic level and is implemented using custom approach based on the condition of each store and characteristic of the surrounding neighborhood when building new store we compete with other retailer and business for suitable location for our store many of our expected new store site are smaller non standard footprint located in fully developed market which require change to our supply chain practice and are generally more time consuming expensive and uncertain undertaking than expansion into undeveloped suburban and ex urban market pursuing the wrong remodel or new store opportunity any delay cost increase disruption or other uncertainty related to those opportunity and lower than expected sale from those opportunity could adversely impact our result of operation our business also relies on investment in technology and selective acquisition and the return on these investment can be le predictable than remodeling and building store we are currently making and expect to continue to make significant investment in technology and selective acquisition to improve guest experience across sale channel and improve our supply chain and inventory management system these investment might not provide the anticipated benefit or desired return in addition if we are unable to successfully protect any intellectual property right resulting from our investment the value received from those investment may be eroded which could adversely affect our financial condition targeting the wrong investment opportunity failing to successfully meet our strategic objective when making the correct investment being unable to make new concept scalable making an investment commitment significantly above or below our need or failing to effectively incorporate acquired business into our business could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely affect our financial condition or result of operation significant disruption in our computer system and our inability to adequately maintain and update those system could adversely affect our operation and our ability to maintain guest confidence we rely extensively on our computer system to manage and account for inventory process guest transaction manage and maintain the privacy of guest data communicate with our vendor and other third party service target branded credit and debit card account and summarize and analyze result we also rely on continued and unimpeded access to the internet to use our computer system our system are subject to damage or interruption from power outage telecommunication failure computer virus malicious attack security breach and catastrophic event if our system are damaged or fail to function properly or reliably we may incur substantial repair or replacement cost experience data loss or theft and impediment to our ability to manage inventory or process guest transaction engage in additional promotional activity to retain our guest and encounter lost guest confidence which could adversely affect our result of operation we continually invest to maintain and update our computer system implementing significant system change increase the risk of computer system disruption the potential problem and interruption associated with implementing technology initiative well providing training and support for those initiative could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency and could negatively impact guest experience and guest confidence data security and privacy risksif our effort to protect the security of information about our guest team member vendor and other third party are unsuccessful we may face additional costly government enforcement action and private litigation and our sale and reputation could suffer we regularly receive and store information about our guest team member vendor and other third party we have program in place to detect contain and respond to data security incident however because the technique used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage system change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long period of time we may be unable to anticipate these technique or implement adequate preventive measure in addition hardware software or application we develop or procure from third party or through open source solution may contain defect in design or manufacture or other problem that could unexpectedly compromise information security unauthorized party may also attempt to gain access to our system or facility or those of third party with whom we do business through fraud trickery or other form of deceiving our team member contractor and vendor the data breach we experienced in the fourth quarter of all incident we encountered were insignificant the data breach we experienced in wa significant and went undetected for several week we and our vendor data security incident subsequent to the data breach however to date these other incident have not been material to our consolidated financial statement based on the prominence and notoriety of the data breach even minor additional data security incident could draw greater scrutiny if we our vendor or other third party with whom we do business experience additional significant data security breach or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breach we could be exposed to additional government enforcement action and private litigation in addition our guest could lose confidence in our ability to protect their information which could cause to discontinue using our redcards or loyalty program or stop shopping with altogether supply chain and third party riskschanges in our relationship with our vendor change in tax policy or trade relation interruption in our supply chain or increased commodity or supply chain cost could adversely affect our result of operation we are dependent on our vendor to supply merchandise to our distribution center store and guest we continue to add capability operating our fulfillment network becomes more complex and challenging if our fulfillment network not operate properly or if vendor fails to deliver on it commitment we could experience merchandise of stock delivery delay or increased delivery cost which could lead to lost sale and decreased guest confidence and adversely affect our result of operation large portion of our merchandise is sourced directly or indirectly from outside the united state with china our single largest source any major change in tax policy or trade relation such the imposition of additional tariff duty on imported product could adversely affect our business result of operation effective income tax rate liquidity and net income political or financial instability currency fluctuation change in trade policy trade restriction tariff or duty the outbreak of pandemic labor unrest transport capacity and cost port security weather condition natural disaster or other event that could slow or disrupt port activity and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could materially disrupt our supply of merchandise increase our cost and or adversely affect our result of operation have been periodic labor dispute impacting the united state port that have caused to make alternative arrangement to continue the flow of inventory and if these type of dispute recur worsen or occur in other country through which we source product it may have material impact on our cost or inventory supply change in the cost of procuring commodity used in our merchandise or the cost related to our supply chain including vendor cost labor fuel tariff duty currency exchange rate and supply chain transparency initiative could have an adverse effect on gross margin expense and result of operation change in our relationship with our vendor also have the potential to increase our expense and adversely affect result of operation disruption in relationship with third party service provider could adversely affect our operation we rely on third party to support our business including portion of our technology development and support our digital platform and fulfillment operation credit and debit card transaction processing extension of credit for our redcard reward loyalty program the clinic and pharmacy operated by cv within our store the infrastructure supporting our guest contact center aspect of our food offering and delivery service if we are unable to contract with third party the specialized skill needed to support those strategy or integrate their product and service with our business if we fail to properly manage those third party if they fail to meet our performance standard and expectation including with respect to data security our reputation sale and result of operation could be adversely affected in addition we could face increased cost or be limited in finding replacement provider or hiring and retaining team member to provide these service in house for example if our guest unfavorably view cv operation or if our relationship with cv doe not meet our strategic objective our ability to discontinue the relationship is limited and our result of operation may be adversely affected legal regulatory global and other external risksour earnings depend on the state of macroeconomic condition and consumer confidence in the united state virtually all of our sale are in the united state making our result highly dependent on united state consumer confidence and the health of the united state economy in addition significant portion of our total sale is derived from store located in five state california texas florida minnesota and illinois resulting in dependence on local economic condition in these state deterioration in macroeconomic condition or consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many way including slowing sale growth reducing overall sale and reducing gross margin these consideration impact the success of our credit card program although we no longer own consumer credit card receivables portfolio we share in the profit generated by the credit card program with td bank group td which owns the receivables generated by our proprietary credit card deterioration in macroeconomic condition could adversely affect the volume of new credit account the amount of credit card program balance and the ability of credit card holder to pay their balance these condition could result in receiving lower profit sharing payment uncharacteristic or significant weather condition alone or together with natural disaster could adversely affect our operation uncharacteristic or significant weather condition can affect consumer shopping pattern particularly in apparel and seasonal item which could lead to lost sale or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our short term result of operation in addition our three largest state by total sale are california texas and florida area where natural disaster are more prevalent natural disaster in those state or in other area where our sale are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our store distribution center or key vendor and cause delay in the distribution of merchandise from our vendor to our distribution center store and guest which could adversely affect our result of operation by increasing our cost and lowering our sale rely on large global and changing workforce of team member contractor and temporary staffing if we do not effectively manage our workforce and the concentration of work in certain global location our labor cost and result of operation could be adversely affected with over team member our workforce cost represent our largest operating expense and our business is dependent on our ability to attract train and retain the appropriate mix of qualified team member contractor and temporary staffing and effectively organize and manage those resource our business and strategic priority change many team member are in entry level or part time position with historically high turnover rate our ability to meet our changing labor need while controlling our cost is subject to external factor such labor law and regulation unemployment level prevailing wage rate collective bargaining effort health care and other benefit cost changing demographic and our reputation and relevance within the labor market if we are unable to attract and retain adequate number and an appropriate mix of qualified team member contractor and temporary staffing our operation guest service level support function and competitiveness could suffer those factor together with increasing wage and benefit cost could adversely affect our result of operation we are periodically subject to labor organizing effort if we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreement in the future it could adversely affect our labor cost and we operate our business we have office in india and china where there ha generally been greater political financial environmental and health instability than the united state an extended disruption of our operation in india or office in china could adversely affect our operation and financial result failure to address product safety and sourcing concern could adversely affect our sale and result of operation if our merchandise offering do not meet applicable safety standard or target or our guest expectation regarding safety supply chain transparency and integrity of source of supply we could experience lost sale and increased cost and be exposed to legal and reputational risk all of our vendor must comply with applicable product safety law and we are dependent on them to ensure that the product we buy comply with all safety standard event that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concern including food or drug contamination could expose to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recall and other liability our sourcing vendor must also meet our expectation across multiple area of social compliance including supply chain transparency and source of supply we have social compliance audit process but we are also dependent on our vendor to ensure that the product we buy comply with our standard negative guest perception regarding the safety of the product we sell and event that give rise to actual potential or perceived social compliance concern could hurt our reputation result in lost sale cause our guest to seek alternative source for their need and make it difficult and costly for to regain the confidence of our guest our failure to comply with federal state local and international law or change in these law could increase our cost reduce our margin and lower our sale our business is subject to wide array of law and regulation in the united state and other country in which we operate our expense could increase and our operation could be adversely affected by significant legislative change to workforce related issue including an employer obligation to recognize collective bargaining unit the process by which collective bargaining agreement are negotiated or imposed the classification of exempt and non exempt employee the distinction employee and contractor minimum wage requirement advance scheduling notice requirement and health care mandate in addition change in the regulatory environment affecting privacy and information security product safety payment method and related fee responsible sourcing supply chain transparency or environmental protection among others could cause our expense to increase without an ability to pas through any increased expense through higher price in addition if we fail to comply with other applicable law and regulation including wage and hour law the foreign corrupt practice act and local anti bribery law we could be subject to reputation and legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our result of operation by increasing our cost reducing our margin and lowering our sale riskschanges in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our business result of operation liquidity and net income number of factor influence our effective income tax rate including change in tax law and related regulation tax treaty interpretation of existing law and our ability to sustain our reporting position on examination change in any of those factor could change our effective tax rate which could adversely affect our net income in addition our operation outside of the united state may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate if we are unable to access the capital market or obtain bank credit our financial position liquidity and result of operation could suffer we are dependent on stable liquid and well functioning financial system to fund our operation and capital investment our continued access to financial market depends on multiple factor including the condition of debt capital market our operating performance and maintaining strong credit rating if rating agency lower our credit rating it could adversely impact our ability to access the debt market our cost of fund and other term for new debt issuance each of the credit rating agency review it rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same in addition we use variety of derivative product to manage our exposure to market risk principally interest rate and equity price

offset by million of deferred income tax expense from our foreign operation in due to change effected by the tax act and other reason we have not asserted indefinite reinvestment in our foreign operation certain other provision of the tax act not expected to have material impact on net income are follows through the tax act allows company to immediately deduct the cost of certain capital expenditure from taxable income instead of deducting the cost over time this provision phase out over the tax act implement territorial tax system and imposes one time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated accumulated foreign earnings of december the one time repatriation tax did not materially affect our net tax expense because in the aggregate our foreign entity have an accumulated earnings deficit driven by our discontinued operation although the tax act generally eliminates federal income tax on dividend from foreign subsidiary it creates new requirement that certain income referred to global intangible low taxed income earned by controlled foreign corporation must be included currently in the gross income of the entity shareholder the tax act limit the deductibility of interest executive compensation and certain other expense described in note of the financial statement certain aspect of our income tax provision related to the tax act amount are provisional we expect effective tax rate of percent to percent we expect corresponding operating cash flow benefit from the lower rate and to lesser degree additional operating cash flow benefit from the immediate

february million of cash and cash equivalent were held at entity located outside the united state there are no substantial tax or restriction to repatriate these holding for domestic use our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short term investment this policy allows investment in large money market fund or in highly rated direct short term instrument that mature in day or le we also place dollar limit on our investment in individual fund or instrument capital allocationwe follow disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation based on the following priority ranked in order of importance first we fully invest in opportunity to profitably grow our business create sustainable long term value and maintain our current operation and asset second we maintain competitive quarterly dividend and seek to grow it annually and finally we return any excess cash to shareholder by repurchasing share within the limit of our credit rating goal operating cash flowsoperating cash flow provided by continuing operation wa million in compared with million in the operating cash flow increase is due to increased payable leverage primarily driven by change in vendor payment term in partially offset by an inventory increase in compared to decrease during the operating cash flow increase is also partially due to the payment of approximately million of tax during related to the pharmacy transaction inventoryyear end inventory wa million compared with million in we increased inventory in to support higher sale expenditure in addition to these cash investment we entered into lease related to new store in and with total future minimum lease payment of million million and million respectively capital expenditure increased in from the prior year primarily due to increased investment in existing store we accelerated our current store remodel program this investment acceleration follows an increase in compared to due to increased remodels and guest experience enhancement in these increase were partially offset by capital expenditure reduction driven by efficiency gain in technology we expect capital expenditure in to increase to approximately billion we accelerate the rate of store remodels continue our current rate of small format store opening and continue to make supply chain investment we also expect to continue our current rate of investment in store lease dividendswe paid dividend totaling million per share in and million per share in per share increase of percent we declared dividend totaling million per share in per share increase of percent over we declared dividend totaling million per share in per share increase of percent over we have paid dividend every quarter since our initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future share repurchasesduring and we returned million million and million respectively to shareholder through share repurchase see part ii item of this annual report on form and note to the financial statement for more information financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital market to maintain balanced spectrum of debt maturity and to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility within these parameter we seek to minimize our borrowing cost our ability to access the long term debt and commercial paper market ha provided with ample source of liquidity our continued access to these market depends on multiple factor including the condition of debt capital market our operating performance and maintaining strong credit rating of february our credit rating were follows credit ratingsmoody sstandard and poor sfitchlong term commercial paperp our credit rating were lowered our ability to access the debt market our cost of fund and other term for new debt issuance could be adversely impacted each of the credit rating agency review it rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same described above in we transitioned to longer payment term with many of our supplier because of these change we expect le variability in our working capital need throughout the year we continue to better match payable to inventory level in we funded our holiday sale period working capital need through internally generated fund in we funded our peak holiday sale period working capital need through internally generated fund and the issuance of commercial paper we have additional liquidity through committed billion revolving credit facility obtained through group of bank in october in october we extended this credit facility by one year to expire in october this unsecured revolving credit facility replaced billion unsecured revolving credit facility that wa scheduled to expire in october no balance were outstanding under either credit facility at any time during or most of our long term debt obligation contain covenant related to secured debt level in addition to secured debt level covenant our credit facility also contains debt leverage covenant we are and expect to remain in compliance with these covenant additionally at february no note or debenture contained provision requiring acceleration of payment upon credit rating downgrade except that certain outstanding note allow the note holder to put the note to if within matter of month of each other we experience both change in control and ii our long term credit rating are either reduced and the resulting rating is non investment grade or our long term credit rating are placed on watch for possible reduction and those rating are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non investment grade note of the financial statement provides more information about financing

reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement see note of the financial statement for further information purchase obligation include all legally binding contract such firm minimum commitment for inventory purchase merchandise royalty equipment purchase marketing related contract software acquisition license commitment and service contract we issue inventory purchase order in the normal course of business which represent authorization to purchase that are cancelable by their term we do not consider purchase order to be firm inventory commitment therefore they are excluded from the table above if we choose to cancel purchase order we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlay incurred prior to cancellation we also issue trade letter of credit in the ordinary course of business which are excluded from this table these obligation are conditioned on term of the letter of credit being met real estate obligation include commitment for the purchase construction or remodeling of real estate and facility we have not included obligation under our pension plan in the contractual obligation table above because no additional amount are required to be funded of february our historical practice regarding these plan ha been to contribute amount necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirement plus periodic discretionary amount determined to be appropriate off balance sheet arrangement other than the unrecorded contractual obligation noted above we do not have any arrangement or relationship with entity that are not consolidated into the financial statement critical accounting estimatesour consolidated financial statement are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires to make estimate and apply judgment that affect the reported amount in the note to consolidated financial statement we describe the significant accounting policy used in preparing the consolidated financial statement our management ha discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimate with the audit finance committee of our board of director the following item require significant estimation or judgment inventory and cost of sale our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market we reduce inventory for estimated loss related to shrink and markdowns our shrink estimate is based on historical loss verified by physical inventory count historically our actual physical inventory count result have shown our estimate to be reliable market adjustment for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise ha diminished we believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turn in le than three month inventory wa million and million at february and january respectively and is further described in note of the financial statement income we receive various form of consideration from our vendor vendor income principally earned result of volume rebate markdown allowance promotion and advertising allowance substantially all vendor income is recorded reduction of cost of sale we establish receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on the agreement in place this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned the majority of the year end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that the assumption used in our estimate will change significantly historically adjustment to our vendor income receivable have not been material vendor income receivable wa million and million at february and january respectively vendor income is described further in note of the financial statement long lived asset long lived asset are reviewed for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flow independent of other asset an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flow from the operation and or disposition of the asset are le than their carrying amount measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over it fair value fair value is measured using discounted cash flow or independent opinion of value appropriate we recorded impairment of million million and million in and respectively which are described further in note of the financial statement goodwill we perform an impairment test of goodwill at least annually and more frequently if event or circumstance occur that would indicate reduced fair value in our reporting unit could exist typically we perform qualitative assessment in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the fair value of the goodwill during our qualitative assessment we make significant estimate assumption and judgment including but not limited to the macroeconomic condition industry and market condition cost factor including product and sg cost overall financial performance of the company change in our share price and relevant company specific event if we determine that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the fair value of the goodwill we perform the first step of the impairment process which compare the fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying amount including the goodwill we have not been required to perform quantitative analysis of goodwill in or we recorded million impairment of goodwill in related to the wind down of noncore operation insurance self insurance we retain substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability worker compensation property loss and team member medical and dental claim however we maintain stop loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risk liability associated with these loss include estimate of both claim filed and loss incurred but not yet reported we use actuarial method which consider number of factor to estimate our ultimate cost of loss general liability and worker compensation liability are recorded at our estimate of their net present value other liability referred to above are not discounted our worker compensation and general liability accrual wa million and million at february and january respectively we believe that the amount accrued are appropriate however our liability could be significantly affected if future occurrence or loss development differ from our assumption for example five percent increase or decrease in average claim cost would impact our self insurance expense by million in historically adjustment to our estimate have not been material refer to item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk for further disclosure of the market risk associated with these exposure we maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain event including network security matter income tax we pay income tax based on the tax statute regulation and case law of the various jurisdiction in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amount of deductible and taxable item and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matter in dispute with tax authority we recognized the income tax effect of the tax act in our financial statement in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no which provides sec staff guidance for the application of asc topic income tax in the reporting period in which the president signed the tax act into law note of the financial statement provides additional information the benefit of uncertain tax position are recorded in our financial statement only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax position would withstand challenge by taxing authority we periodically reassess these probability and record any change in the financial statement appropriate liability for uncertain tax position including interest and penalty were million and million at february and january respectively primarily relate to continuing operation we believe the resolution of these matter will not have material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statement income tax are described further in note of the financial statement pension accounting we maintain funded qualified defined benefit pension plan well several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plan for certain current and retired team member the cost for these plan are determined based on actuarial calculation using the assumption described in the following paragraph eligibility and the level of benefit varies depending on team member full time or part time status date of hire age and or length of service the benefit obligation and related expense for these plan are determined based on actuarial calculation using assumption about the expected long term rate of return the discount rate and compensation growth rate the assumption with adjustment made for any significant plan or participant change are used to determine the period end benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year our expected long term rate of return on plan asset of percent is determined by the portfolio composition historical long term investment performance and current market condition one percentage point decrease in our expected long term rate of return would increase annual expense by million the discount rate used to determine benefit obligation is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bond using yield for maturity that are in line with the duration of our pension liability our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with change in interest rate percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million based on our experience we use graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger shorter service pension eligible team member than it doe for older longer service pension eligible team member pension benefit are further described in note of the financial statement legal and other contingency we believe the accrual recorded in our consolidated financial statement properly reflect loss exposure that are both probable and reasonably estimable we do not believe any of the currently identified claim or litigation may materially affect our result of operation cash flow or financial condition however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainty and unfavorable ruling could occur if an unfavorable ruling were to occur it may cause material adverse impact on the result of operation cash flow or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs or future period refer to note of the financial statement for further information on contingency new accounting pronouncementsrefer to note note note and note of the financial statement for description of new accounting pronouncement related to revenue lease pension expense and accumulated other comprehensive income respectively we do not expect any other recently issued accounting pronouncement will have material effect on our financial statement looking statementsthis report contains forward looking statement which are based on our current assumption and expectation these statement are typically accompanied by the word expect may could believe would might anticipates or word of similar import the principal forward looking statement in this report include our financial performance statement regarding the adequacy of and cost associated with our source of liquidity the expected impact of the pharmacy transaction on our financial performance the continued execution of our share repurchase program our expected capital expenditure and new lease commitment the impact of change in the expected effective income tax rate on net income including those resulting from the tax act the impact of certain tax act provision on our cash flow the expected compliance with debt covenant the expected impact and timing of adopting new accounting pronouncement our intention regarding future dividend contribution and payment related to our pension plan the expected return on pension plan asset the expected timing and recognition of compensation expense the effect of macroeconomic condition the adequacy of our reserve for general liability worker compensation and property loss the expected outcome of and adequacy of our reserve for investigation inquiry claim and litigation expected change to our contractual obligation and liability the expected ability to recognize deferred tax asset and liability and the timing of such recognition the resolution of tax matter and change in our assumption and expectation all such forward looking statement are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statement contained in the private security litigation reform act of amended although we believe there is reasonable basis for the forward looking statement our actual result could be materially different the most important factor which could cause our actual result to differ from our forward looking statement are set forth on our description of risk factor in item to this form which should be read in conjunction with the forward looking statement in this report forward looking statement speak only of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskat february our exposure to market risk wa primarily from interest rate change on our debt obligation of which are at libor plus floating rate our interest rate exposure is primarily due to difference between our floating rate debt obligation compared to our floating rate short term investment at february our floating rate short term investment exceeded our floating rate debt by approximately million based on our balance sheet position at february the annualized effect of percentage point increase in floating interest rate on our floating rate debt obligation net of our floating rate short term investment would not be significant in general we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short term investment over time but that may vary in different interest rate environment see further description of our debt and derivative instrument in note and to the financial statement we record our general liability and worker compensation liability at net present value therefore these liability fluctuate with change in interest rate based on our balance sheet position at february the annualized effect of percentage point decrease in interest rate would be to decrease earnings before income tax by million in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuation on our qualified defined benefit pension plan the value of our pension liability is inversely related to change in interest rate percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million to protect decline in interest rate we hold high quality long duration bond and interest rate swap in our pension plan trust at year end we had hedged percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status more fully described in note and to the financial statement we are exposed to market return on accumulated team member balance in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan we control the risk of offering the nonqualified plan by making investment in life insurance contract and prepaid forward contract on our own common stock that offset substantial portion of our economic exposure to the return on these plan the annualized effect of one percentage point change in market return on our nonqualified defined contribution plan inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicle used to manage our economic exposure would not be significant there have been no other material change in our primary risk exposure or management of market risk since the prior year financial statement and supplementary datareport of management on
