biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design and related field we also utilize research committee and advisory board made of athlete coach trainer equipment manager

raw material in bulk for the manufacturing of our footwear apparel and equipment product most raw material are available and purchased by those independent contractor and supplier in the country manufacturing take place we have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirement since sojitz corporation of america sojitz america large japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock ha performed significant import export financing service for during fiscal sojitz america provided financing and purchasing service for nike brand product sold in argentina uruguay canada brazil india indonesia the philippine malaysia south africa china korea and thailand excluding product produced and sold in the same country approximately of nike brand sale occurred in those country any failure of sojitz america to provide these service or any failure of sojitz america bank could disrupt our ability to acquire product from our supplier and to deliver product to our customer in those jurisdiction such disruption could result in cancelled order that would adversely affect sale and profitability however we believe that any such disruption would be short term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative source of financing at competitive rate our current agreement with sojitz america expire on may table of content international operation and trade our international operation and source of supply are subject to the usual risk of business abroad such possible revaluation of currency export and import duty anti dumping measure quota safeguard measure trade restriction restriction on the transfer of fund and in certain part of the world political instability and terrorism we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk can not predict the likelihood of such development occurring the global economic recession resulted in significant slow in international trade and sharp rise in protectionist action around the world these trend are affecting many global manufacturing and service sector and the footwear and apparel industry whole are not immune company in our industry are facing trade protectionist challenge in many different region and in nearly all case we are working together to address trade issue to reduce the impact to the industry while observing applicable competition law notwithstanding our effort such action if implemented could result in increase in the cost of our product which may in turn adversely affect our sale or profitability and the imported footwear and apparel industry whole accordingly we are actively monitoring the development described footwear import into the european union in at the request of the european domestic footwear industry the european commission ec initiated investigation into leather footwear imported from china and vietnam together with other company in our industry we took the position that special technology athletic footwear staf not be within the scope of the investigation and ii not meet the legal requirement of injury and price in an anti dumping investigation our argument were successful and the eu agreed in october on definitive duty of for china and for vietnam for non staf leather footwear but excluded staf from the final measure prior to the scheduled expiration in october of the measure imposed on the non staf footwear the domestic industry requested and the ec agreed to review petition to extend these restriction on non staf leather footwear in december following review of the ongoing restriction eu member state voted to extend the measure for an additional month march in early the ec declined to extend the measure and since april these restriction have been terminated the ec noted at the time that would monitor leather footwear import from vietnam and china the next month no new trade defense action have been taken by the ec on february the chinese government announced it would seek to refer the eu decision both on the original measure and subsequent review decision to the world trade organization wto for it further review and decision on may the dispute settlement body of the wto agreed to establish panel to rule on china claim the eu with respect to the above anti dumping measure on october the wto issued ruling in which it supported china position on number of issue neither party ha filed an appeal footwear apparel and equipment import into brazil and argentina at the request of certain domestic footwear industry participant both brazil and argentina have initiated independent anti dumping investigation against footwear made in china over the last two year we have been working with broad coalition of other company in our industry to challenge these case on the basis that the athletic footwear imported from china should not be within the scope of the investigation and ii doe not meet the legal requirement of injury and price in an anti dumping investigation in the case of argentina in the final determination made by the administering authority wa favorable to in the case of brazil the administering authority agreed to impose an anti dumping duty against nearly all footwear from china which we believe will impact all brand in the footwear industry this decision doe not materially affect in october the brazilian government initiated an anti circumvention investigation to determine whether chinese made product or component were subject to minimal assembly or finishing in vietnam or indonesia to evade anti dumping duty on chinese made product in july the brazilian government found no circumvention wa taking place and this matter is closed many product including footwear apparel and equipment that we and others in our industry import into argentina and brazil are subject to the wto non automatic licensing requirement which mean that it may take up to day for those product to clear custom and enter into those jurisdiction from time to time in addition to these wto licensing requirement these jurisdiction impose further importation restriction or limitation result we have experienced delay in our ability to import our product or it ha taken longer the time allowed under the wto for to import our product to date our business ha not been materially affected by these restriction or delay in the future however if we are unable to import our product into these jurisdiction due to these or other restriction or if we experience increasing or more frequent delay beyond the wto permitted day to import our product our business could be materially affected footwear apparel and equipment import into turkey in turkey introduced safeguard measure in the form of additional duty on all imported footwear into turkey with the goal of protecting it local shoe manufacturing industry until august in june turkish shoe manufacturer submitted and the turkish government agreed to review request for extension of the safeguard measure claiming that the rehabilitation process of the local turkish industry wa interrupted due to the continuing increase of footwear import despite the importer opposition to the continuation of the safeguard measure the turkish authority extended these safeguard measure until august but reduced the duty from per pair of footwear to per pair of footwear in june the government of turkey launched an expiry review on the footwear safeguard to ass if they should be extended for three additional year until august together with other company in our industry we are advocating for exclusion of certain footwear product staf shoe that can not be manufactured in turkey and therefore should not be subject to higher import duty in two new safeguard measure and review were initiated by the turkish undersecretariat of foreign trade uft on apparel and equipment import in january the uft began an investigation on apparel import that could result in increase in import duty applied to imported apparel product regardless of country of origin and with exception for eu table of content and country that are included in cross cumulation of origin system in the framework of the free trade agreement to which turkey is party subject to evidence of preferential origin in july these higher import duty were approved and will be in place through july together with other company in our industry we advocated for exclusion of certain apparel product used for sporting activity that can not be manufactured in turkey and therefore should not be subject to higher import duty but no exclusion ha been granted in february the uft began review of existing safeguard measure on travel good handbag and similar accessory and container listed under applicable regulation one turkish bag manufacturer association ha requested the continuation of the safeguard measure through april with the application of an additional import duty of kg max unit to kg max unit regardless of country of origin in october these higher import duty were approved and will be in place through april together with other company in our industry we advocated for the exclusion of non leather bag from the scope of the continued safeguard but no exclusion ha been granted trade relation with china china represents an important sourcing country and consumer marketing country for many government around the world are concerned about china growing and fast paced economy compliance with wto rule currency valuation and high trade surplus result wide range of legislative proposal have been introduced to address these concern we are working with broad coalition of global business and trade association representing wide variety of sector service manufacturing and agriculture to help ensure any legislation enacted and implemented address legitimate and core concern ii is consistent with international trade rule and iii reflects and considers china domestic economy and the important role it ha in the global economic community we believe other company in our industry well most other multi national company are in similar position regarding these trade measure in the event any of these trade protection measure are implemented we believe that we have the ability to develop over period of time adequate alternative source of supply for the product obtained from our present supplier if event prevented from acquiring product from our supplier in particular country our operation could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe we could abate any such disruption and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of short term nature we believe our principal competitor are subject to similar risk competition the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the united state and on worldwide basis we compete internationally with significant number of athletic and leisure shoe company athletic and leisure apparel company sport equipment company and large company diversified line of athletic and leisure shoe apparel and equipment including adidas puma and others the intense competition and the rapid change in technology and consumer preference in the market for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factor in our operation nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world performance and reliability of shoe apparel and equipment new product development price product identity through marketing and promotion and customer support and service are important aspect of competition in the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry to help market our product we contract with prominent and influential athlete coach team college and sport league to endorse our brand and use our product and we actively sponsor sporting event and clinic we believe that we are competitive in all of these area trademark and patent we utilize trademark on nearly all of our product and believe having distinctive mark that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating market for our good in identifying our brand and the company and in distinguishing our good from the good of others we consider our nike and swoosh design trademark to be among our most valuable asset and we have registered these trademark in almost jurisdiction in addition we own many other trademark that we utilize in marketing our product we continue to vigorously protect our trademark against infringement nike ha an exclusive worldwide license to make and sell footwear using patented air technology the process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane some of the early nike air

patent and thousand of and foreign design patent covering component manufacturing technique and feature used in various athletic and leisure shoe apparel athletic equipment digital device and golf product these patent expire at various time and patent issued for application filed this year will last from to for design patent and from now to for utility patent we believe our success depends

online advertising if we do not successfully market our product or if advertising and promotional cost increase these factor could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation we rely on technical innovation and high quality product to compete in the market for our product technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our product research and development play key role in technical innovation we rely upon specialist in the field of biomechanics exercise physiology engineering industrial design and related field well research committee and advisory board made up of athlete coach trainer equipment manager orthopedist podiatrist and other expert to develop and test cutting edge performance product while we strive to produce product that help to reduce injury enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our product consumer demand for our product could decline and if we experience problem with the quality of our product we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problem failure to continue to obtain high quality endorser of our product could harm our business we establish relationship with professional athlete sport team and league to evaluate promote and establish product authenticity with consumer if certain endorser were to stop using our product contrary to their endorsement agreement our business could be adversely affected in addition action taken by athlete team or league associated with our product that harm the reputation of those athlete team or league could also harm our brand image with consumer and result could have an adverse effect on our sale and financial condition in addition poor performance by our endorser failure to continue to correctly identify promising athlete to use and endorse our product or failure to enter into cost effective endorsement arrangement with prominent athlete and sport organization could adversely affect our brand and result in decreased sale of our product failure of our contractor or our licensee contractor to comply with our code of conduct local law and other standard could harm our business we work with hundred of contractor outside of the united state to manufacture our product and we also have license agreement that permit unaffiliated party to manufacture or contract to manufacture product using our trademark we impose and require our licensee to impose on those contractor code of conduct and other environmental health and safety standard for the benefit of worker we also require these contractor to comply with applicable standard for product safety however from time to time contractor may not comply with such standard or applicable local law or our licensee may not require their contractor to comply with such standard or applicable local law significant or continuing noncompliance with such standard and law by one or more contractor could harm our reputation or result in product recall and result could have an adverse effect on our sale and financial condition global capital and credit market condition and resulting decline in consumer confidence and spending could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition the uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact business around the world the current political and economic global environment ha resulted in continued economic unpredictability particularly in europe where there are concern regarding the increased debt level of certain country and their ability to meet future financial obligation well the overall stability of the euro currency continuing volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit market have led to tightening of business credit and liquidity contraction of consumer credit business failure higher unemployment and decline in consumer confidence and spending in many part of the world if global economic and financial market condition deteriorate or remain weak for an extended period of time the following factor could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our product reduced order from retailer for our product order cancellation lower revenue increased inventory and lower gross margin we may be unable to find suitable investment that are safe liquid and provide reasonable return this could result in lower interest income or longer investment horizon disruption to capital market or the banking system may also impair the value of investment or bank deposit we currently consider safe or liquid we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital market at reasonable rate in the event we find it desirable to do the failure of financial institution counterparties to honor their obligation to under credit and derivative instrument could jeopardize our ability to rely on and benefit from those instrument our ability to replace those instrument on the same or similar term may be limited under poor market condition we conduct transaction in various currency which increase our exposure to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate relative to the dollar continued volatility in the market and exchange rate for foreign currency and contract in foreign currency could have significant impact on our reported financial result and condition continued volatility and availability in the market and price for commodity and raw material we use in our product and in our supply chain such petroleum could have material adverse effect on our cost gross margin and profitability if retailer of our product experience declining revenue or retailer experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit market to purchase our product this could result in reduced order for our product order cancellation inability of retailer to timely meet their payment obligation to extended payment term higher account receivable reduced cash flow greater expense associated with collection effort and increased bad debt expense if retailer of our product experience severe financial difficulty some may become insolvent and cease business operation which could reduce the availability of our product to consumer if contract manufacturer of our product or other participant in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit market to purchase raw material or to finance general working capital need it may result in delay or non delivery of shipment of our product our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuation in our operating result and stock price we experience moderate fluctuation in aggregate sale volume during the year historically revenue in the first and fourth fiscal quarter have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarter however the mix of product sale may vary considerably from time to time result of change in seasonal and geographic demand for particular type of footwear apparel and equipment in addition our customer may cancel order change delivery schedule or change the mix of product ordered with minimal notice result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sale accordingly our result of operation are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period this seasonality along with other factor that are beyond our control including general economic condition change in consumer table of content preference weather condition availability of import quota and currency exchange rate fluctuation could adversely affect our business and cause our result of operation to fluctuate our operating margin are also sensitive to number of factor that are beyond our control including manufacturing and transportation cost shift in product sale mix geographic sale trend and currency exchange rate fluctuation all of which we expect to continue result of operation in any period should not be considered indicative of the result to be expected for any future period future order may not be an accurate indication of our future revenue we make substantial use of our future ordering program which allows retailer to order five to six month in advance of delivery with the commitment that their order will be delivered within set period of time at fixed price our future ordering program allows to minimize the amount of product we hold in inventory purchasing cost the time necessary to fill customer order and the risk of non delivery we report change in future order in our periodic financial report although we believe future order are an important indicator of our future revenue reported future order are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of change in revenue for any future period this is because the mix of order can shift between future and at once order in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation order cancellation shipping timing return and discount can cause difference in the comparison between future order and actual revenue moreover significant portion of our revenue is not derived from future order including at once and close out sale of nike brand footwear and apparel sale of nike brand equipment sale from our direct to consumer operation and sale from our other business our future ordering program doe not prevent excess inventory or inventory shortage which could result in decreased operating margin and harm to our business we purchase product from manufacturer outside of our future ordering program and in advance of customer order which we hold in inventory and resell to customer there is risk we may be unable to sell excess product ordered from manufacturer inventory level in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write down and the sale of excess inventory at discounted price could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating result and financial condition conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our product or if our manufacturer fail to supply product we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortage inventory shortage might delay shipment to customer negatively impact retailer and distributor relationship and diminish brand loyalty the difficulty in forecasting demand also make it difficult to estimate our future result of operation and financial condition from period to period failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our product could adversely affect our net revenue and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effect with any certainty in advance we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our retailer we extend credit to our customer based on an assessment of customer financial condition generally without requiring collateral to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal product we offer customer the ability to place order five to six month ahead of delivery under our future ordering program these advance order may be cancelled and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially ailing retailer or retailer struggling with economic uncertainty in the past some customer have experienced financial difficulty which have had an adverse effect on our business result retailer may be more cautious than usual with order result of weakness in the retail economy slowing economy in our key market could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customer which in turn could have an adverse effect on our result of operation and financial condition in addition product sale are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing store environment to attract consumer which requires continuing investment by retailer retailer who experience financial difficulty may fail to make such investment or delay them resulting in lower sale and order for our product consolidation of retailer or concentration of retail market share among retailer may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell our product the athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail market in some country are dominated by few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailer with many store these retailer have in the past increased their market share and may continue to do so in the future by expanding through acquisition and construction of additional store these situation concentrate our credit risk with relatively small number of retailer and if any of these retailer were to experience shortage of liquidity it would increase the risk that their outstanding payable to may not be paid in addition increasing market share concentration among one or few retailer in particular country or region increase the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchase of our product we may be unable to find sufficient number of other retail outlet for our product to sustain the same level of sale and revenue failure to adequately protect our intellectual property right could adversely affect our business we utilize trademark on nearly all of our product and believe that having distinctive mark that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating market for our good in identifying and in distinguishing our good from the good of others we consider our nike and swoosh design trademark to be among our most valuable asset and we have registered these trademark in almost jurisdiction in addition we own many other trademark that we utilize in marketing our product we believe that our trademark patent and other intellectual property right are important to our brand our success and our competitive position we periodically discover product that are counterfeit reproduction of our product or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property right if we are unsuccessful in challenging party product on the basis of trademark or design or utility patent infringement continued sale of these product could adversely affect our sale and our brand and result in the shift of consumer preference away from our product the action we take to establish and protect trademark patent and other intellectual property right may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our product by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sale of our product violation of proprietary right we may be subject to liability if third party successfully claim that we infringe their trademark patent or other intellectual property right defending infringement claim could be expensive and time consuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreement we also may be subject to significant damage or injunction against development and sale of certain product in addition the law of certain foreign country may not protect intellectual property right to the same extent the law of the united state we may face significant expense and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property right outside the united state and if we are unable to successfully protect our right or resolve intellectual property conflict with others our business or financial condition may be adversely affected we are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceeding which could result in unexpected expense of time and resource from time to time we are called upon to defend against lawsuit and regulatory action relating to our business due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation and regulatory proceeding we can not accurately table of content predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceeding an unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operation in addition any significant litigation in the future regardless of it merit could divert management attention from our operation and result in substantial legal fee our international operation involve inherent risk which could result in harm to our business virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the united state and the majority of our product are sold outside of the united state accordingly we are subject to the risk generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad which include foreign law and regulation varying consumer preference across geographic region political unrest disruption or delay in cross border shipment and change in economic condition in country in which we manufacture or sell product in addition disease outbreak terrorist act and military conflict have increased the risk of doing business abroad these factor among others could affect our ability to manufacture product or procure material our ability to import product our ability to sell product in international market and our cost of doing business if any of these or other factor make the conduct of business in particular country undesirable or impractical our business could be adversely affected in addition many of our imported product are subject to duty tariff or quota that affect the cost and quantity of various type of good imported into the united state and other country any country in which our product are produced or sold may eliminate adjust or impose new quota duty tariff safeguard measure anti dumping duty cargo restriction to prevent terrorism restriction on the transfer of currency climate change legislation product safety regulation or other charge or restriction any of which could have an adverse effect on our result of operation and financial condition change in tax law and unanticipated tax liability could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability we are subject to income tax in the united state and numerous foreign jurisdiction our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by number of factor including change in the mix of earnings in country with differing statutory tax rate change in the valuation of deferred tax asset and liability change in tax law the outcome of income tax audit in various jurisdiction around the world and any repatriation of non earnings for which we have not previously provided for tax we regularly ass all of these matter to determine the adequacy of our tax provision which is subject to significant discretion currency exchange rate fluctuation could result in lower revenue higher cost and decreased margin and earnings majority of our product are sold outside of the united state result we conduct transaction in various currency which increase our exposure to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate relative to the dollar our international revenue and expense generally are derived from sale and operation in foreign currency and these revenue and expense could be affected by currency fluctuation including amount recorded in foreign currency and translated into dollar for consolidated financial reporting currency exchange rate fluctuation could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturer that produce our product by making their purchase of raw material more expensive and more difficult to finance foreign currency fluctuation could have an adverse effect on our result of operation and financial condition our hedging activity see note risk management and derivative in the accompanying note to the consolidated financial statement which are designed to minimize and delay but not to completely eliminate the effect of foreign currency fluctuation may not sufficiently mitigate the impact of foreign currency on our financial result factor that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activity include accuracy of sale forecast volatility of currency market and the availability of hedging instrument since the hedging activity are designed to minimize volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of stronger dollar but they also reduce the positive impact of weaker dollar our future financial result could be significantly affected by the value of the dollar in relation to the foreign currency in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial result are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activity our product are subject to risk associated with overseas sourcing manufacturing and financing the principal material used in our apparel product natural and synthetic fabric and thread plastic and metal hardware and specialized performance fabric designed to repel rain retain heat or efficiently transport body moisture are available in country where our manufacturing take place the principal material used in our footwear product natural and synthetic rubber plastic compound foam cushioning material nylon leather canvas and polyurethane film are also locally available to manufacturer nike contractor and supplier buy raw material in bulk there could be significant disruption in the supply of fabric or raw material from current source or in the event of disruption we might not be able to locate alternative supplier of material of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all in addition we can not be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturer will be able to fill our order in timely manner if we experience significant increase in demand or reduction in the availability of material or need to replace an existing manufacturer there can be no assurance that additional supply of fabric or raw material or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on term that are acceptable to or at all or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to in order to meet our requirement in addition even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or source of material we may encounter delay in production and added cost result of the time it take to train supplier and manufacturer in our method product quality control standard and labor health and safety standard any delay interruption or increased cost in the supply of material or manufacture of our product could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our product and result in lower revenue and net income both in the short and long term because independent manufacturer manufacture majority of our product outside of our principal sale market our product must be transported by third party over large geographic distance delay in the shipment or delivery of our product due to the availability of transportation work stoppage port strike infrastructure congestion or other factor and cost and delay associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturer could adversely impact our financial performance in addition manufacturing delay or unexpected demand for our product may require to use faster but more expensive transportation method such aircraft which could adversely affect our profit margin the cost of fuel is significant component in manufacturing and transportation cost so increase in the price of petroleum product can adversely affect our profit margin in addition sojitz america performs significant import export financing service for most of the nike brand product sold outside of the united state europe middle east africa and japan excluding product produced and sold in the same country any failure of sojitz america to provide these service or any failure of sojitz america bank could disrupt our ability to acquire product from our supplier and to deliver product to our customer outside of the united state europe middle east africa and japan such disruption could result in cancelled order that would adversely affect sale and profitability natural disaster could negatively impact our operating result and financial condition natural disaster such earthquake hurricane tsunami or other adverse weather and climate condition whether occurring in the or abroad and the consequence and effect thereof including energy shortage and public health issue could disrupt our operation or the operation of our vendor and other supplier or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating result and financial condition table of content our success depends on our global distribution facility we

basis to address those risk that are material to nike inc we manage these exposure by taking advantage of natural offset and currency correlation that exist within the portfolio and where practical by hedging portion of the remaining material exposure using derivative instrument such forward contract and option described below the implementation of our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk on portfolio basis by increasing the natural offset and currency correlation benefit that exist within our portfolio of aggregate foreign exchange exposure our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate change on the underlying net exposure being hedged where hedged our program ha the effect of delaying the impact of current market rate on our consolidated financial statement the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizon we do not hold or issue derivative instrument for trading purpose transactional exposure we conduct business in various currency and have transaction which subject to foreign currency risk our most significant transactional foreign currency exposure are product cost nike product cost are exposed to fluctuation in foreign currency in the following way non functional currency denominated product purchase certain nike entity purchase product from the nike trading company ntc wholly owned centralized sourcing hub that buy nike branded product from external factory predominantly in dollar the ntc whose functional currency is the dollar then sell the product to nike entity in their respective functional currency when the ntc sell to nike entity with different functional currency the result is foreign currency exposure for the ntc other nike entity purchase product directly from external factory in dollar these purchase generate foreign currency exposure for those nike entity with functional currency other than the dollar in both purchasing scenario weaker dollar reduces the inventory cost incurred by nike whereas stronger dollar increase it cost factory input cost in january nike implemented foreign currency adjustment program with certain factory the program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factory foreign currency exposure some of which are natural offset to our existing foreign currency exposure under this program our payment to these factory are adjusted for rate fluctuation in the basket of currency factory currency exposure index in which the labor material and

net cash outflow of million for fiscal compared to net cash outflow of million for fiscal our investment in working capital increased primarily due to an increase in inventory and prepaid expense inventory at the end of fiscal increased compared to fiscal primarily due to higher product input cost well change in product mix which more than offset the favorable impact of change in currency exchange rate inventory unit for the nike brand grew compared to the prior year driven by growth in future order and improved factory delivery the increase in prepaid expense wa primarily driven by higher prepaid demand creation expense around the european football championship and london summer olympics cash provided by investing activity wa million during fiscal compared to use of cash of

fiscal we have repurchased million share for billion under this program we continue to expect funding of share repurchase will come from operating cash flow excess cash and or debt the timing and the amount of share purchased will be dictated by our capital need and stock market condition capital resource on november we entered into committed credit facility agreement with syndicate of bank which provides for up to billion of borrowing pursuant to revolving credit facility with the option to increase borrowing to billon with lender approval the facility matures in november with one year extension option prior to both the second and third anniversary of the closing date provided that extension shall not extend beyond november this facility replaces the prior billion committed credit facility agreement that would have expired in december of and for the year ended may we had no amount outstanding under our new committed revolving credit facility we currently have long term debt rating of and from standard and poor corporation and moody investor service respectively if our long term debt rating were to decline the facility fee and interest rate under our committed revolving credit facility would increase conversely if our long term debt rating were to improve the facility fee and interest rate would decrease change in our long term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowing or any future borrowing under the committed credit facility under this committed revolving credit facility we have agreed to various covenant these covenant include limit on our disposal of fixed asset the amount of debt secured by lien we may incur well minimum capitalization ratio in the event we were to have any borrowing outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain waiver from majority of the bank in the syndicate any borrowing would become immediately due and payable of may we were in full compliance with each of these covenant and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenant in the foreseeable future liquidity is also provided by our billion commercial paper

fixed income investment are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk all of our investment are investment grade to minimize our credit risk while individual security have varying duration the average duration of our entire cash equivalent and short term investment portfolio is le than day of may despite recent uncertainty in the financial market to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit market or incurred higher interest cost future volatility in the capital market however may increase cost associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instrument or affect our ability to access those market we believe that existing cash cash equivalent short term investment and cash generated by operation together with access to external source of fund described above will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital need in the foreseeable future we utilize variety of tax planning and financing strategy to manage our worldwide cash and deploy fund to location where they are needed we routinely repatriate portion of our foreign earnings for which tax have previously been provided we also indefinitely reinvest significant portion of our foreign earnings and our current plan do not demonstrate need to repatriate these earnings should we require additional capital in the we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign fund or raise capital in the through debt if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign fund we would be required to accrue and pay additional tax le applicable foreign tax credit if we elect to raise capital in the through debt we would incur additional interest expense balance sheet arrangement in connection with various contract and agreement we provide routine indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property right coverage for legal issue that arise and other item where we are acting the guarantor currently we have several such agreement in place however based on

obligated to furnish our endorser with nike product for their use it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis the contract generally do not stipulate specific amount of cash to be spent on the product the amount of product provided to the endorser will depend on many factor including general playing condition the number of sporting event in which

under certain self insurance and other program recently adopted accounting standard in april the financial accounting standard board fasb issued new guidance to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirement between gaap and international financial reporting standard this new guidance which became effective for beginning march amends current gaap fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to include increased transparency around valuation input and investment categorization the adoption did not have material impact on our consolidated financial position or result of operation in january the fasb issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirement related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurement the guidance requires additional disclosure about the different class of asset and liability measured at fair value the valuation technique and input used the activity in level fair value measurement and the transfer between level and of the fair value measurement hierarchy this guidance became effective for beginning march except for disclosure relating to purchase sale issuance and settlement of level asset and liability which became effective for beginning june this guidance only requires expanded disclosure the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or result of operation in october the fasb issued new standard that revised the guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverable these new standard impact the determination of when the individual deliverable included in multiple element arrangement may be treated separate unit of accounting additionally these new standard modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverable by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration these new standard became effective for beginning june the adoption did not have material impact on our consolidated financial position or result of operation table of content recently issued accounting standard in december the fasb issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirement surrounding the nature of an entity right to offset and related arrangement associated with it financial instrument and derivative instrument this new guidance requires company to disclose both gross and net information about instrument and transaction eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instrument and transaction subject to master netting arrangement this new guidance is effective for beginning june this guidance only requires expanded disclosure we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or result of operation in september the fasb issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment this guidance will allow company to ass qualitative factor to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standard this new guidance is effective for beginning june we do not expect the adoption will have material effect on our consolidated financial position or result of operation in june the fasb issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income this new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and it component in the statement of shareholder equity company will now be required to present the component of net income and other comprehensive income in either one continuous statement referred to the statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statement this guidance also required company to present reclassification adjustment out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented however in december the fasb issued guidance which indefinitely defers the requirement related to the presentation of reclassification adjustment both issuance on the presentation of comprehensive income are effective for beginning june this guidance only amends the presentation of the component of comprehensive income we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or result of operation critical accounting policy our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america the preparation of these financial statement requires to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent asset and liability we believe that the estimate assumption and judgment involved in the accounting policy described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statement so we consider these to be our critical accounting policy because of the uncertainty inherent in these matter actual result could differ from the estimate we use in applying the critical accounting policy certain of these critical accounting policy affect working capital account balance including the policy for revenue recognition the allowance for uncollectible account receivable inventory reserve and contingent payment under endorsement contract these policy require that we make estimate in the preparation of our financial statement of given date however since our business cycle is relatively short actual result related to these estimate are generally known within the six month period following the financial statement date thus these policy generally affect only the timing of reported amount across two to three fiscal quarter within the context of these critical accounting policy we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely event or circumstance that would result in materially different amount being reported revenue recognition we record wholesale revenue when title pass and the risk and reward of ownership have passed to the customer based on the term of sale title pass generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer retail store revenue are recorded at the time of sale in some instance we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer our revenue may fluctuate in case when our customer delay accepting shipment of product for period of up to several week in certain country outside of the precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available in these case we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery time by geographic location on the basis of our test of actual transaction we have no indication that these estimate have been materially inaccurate historically part of our revenue recognition policy we record estimated sale return discount and miscellaneous claim from customer reduction to revenue at the time revenue are recorded we base our estimate on historical rate of product return discount and claim specific identification of outstanding claim and outstanding return not yet received from customer and estimated return discount and claim expected but not yet finalized with our customer actual return discount and claim in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimate if actual or expected future return discount and claim were significantly greater or lower than the reserve we had established we would record reduction or increase to net revenue in the period in which we made such determination allowance for uncollectible account receivable we make ongoing estimate relating to the ability to collect our account receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated loss resulting from the inability of our customer to make required payment in determining the amount of the allowance we consider our historical level of credit loss and make judgment about the creditworthiness of significant customer based on ongoing credit evaluation since we can not predict future change in the financial stability of our customer actual future loss from uncollectible account may differ from our estimate if the financial condition of our customer were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payment larger allowance might be required in the event we determine that smaller or larger allowance is appropriate we would record credit or charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such determination is made inventory reserve we also make ongoing estimate relating to the net realizable value of inventory based upon our assumption about future demand and market condition if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is le than the cost of the inventory recorded on our book we record reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded charge to cost of sale if change in market condition result in reduction in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such determination and record charge to cost of sale table of content contingent payment under endorsement contract significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payment under endorsement contract in general endorsement payment are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract however certain contract element may be accounted for differently based upon the fact and circumstance of each individual contract some of the contract provide for contingent payment to endorser based upon specific achievement in their sport winning championship we record selling and administrative expense for these amount when the endorser achieves the specific goal some of the contract provide for payment based upon endorser maintaining level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time maintaining top ranking in sport for year these amount are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period in these instance to the extent that actual payment to the endorser differ from our estimate due to change in the endorser athletic performance increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in future period some of the contract provide for royalty payment to endorser based upon predetermined percentage of sale of particular product we expense these payment in cost of sale the related sale occur in certain contract we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payment for contractual obligation for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fee through sale of product we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sale of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period property plant and equipment and definite lived asset property plant and equipment including building equipment and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost including in some case the cost of internal labor and are depreciated over the estimated useful life change in circumstance such technological advance or change to our business operation can result in difference between the actual and estimated useful life in those case where we determine that the useful life of long lived asset should be shortened we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset net book value to it salvage value we review the carrying value of long lived asset or asset group to be used in operation whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of the asset might not be recoverable factor that would necessitate an impairment assessment include significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used significant adverse change in legal factor or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such fact indicate potential impairment we would ass the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodology that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flow any impairment would be measured the difference between the asset group carrying amount and it estimated fair value goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset we perform annual impairment test on goodwill and intangible asset with indefinite life in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when event occur or circumstance change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below it carrying value event or change in circumstance that may trigger interim impairment review include significant change in business climate operating result planned investment in the reporting unit planned divestiture or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among other factor the impairment test requires to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit if the carrying value of reporting unit exceeds it fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over it implied fair value if any we generally base our measurement of the fair value of reporting unit on blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flow and the market valuation approach the discounted cash flow model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flow that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future our significant estimate in the discounted cash flow model include our weighted average cost of capital long term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit business and working capital effect the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded company in similar line of business significant estimate in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar company with comparable business factor such size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiple in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit indefinite lived intangible asset primarily consist of acquired trade name and trademark in measuring the fair value for these intangible asset we utilize the relief from royalty method this method assumes that trade name and trademark have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalty for the benefit received from them this method requires to estimate the future revenue for the related brand the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital on may we announced our intention to divest of the cole haan and umbro business of may cole haan had no goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset on our balance sheet while umbro had million of goodwill and million of trademark and other intangible asset of may both asset group for cole haan and umbro did not quality asset held for sale under applicable accounting guidance the decision to divest these business wa deemed triggering event to perform an impairment analysis of umbro intangible asset at that date and wa considered in our fourth quarter impairment analysis we are currently in the process of preparing the business for divestiture and identifying potential acquirer therefore we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flow and the market valuation approach is the best method for determining the fair value of the umbro reporting unit because these are the most common valuation methodology used within our industry and the blended use of both model compensates for the inherent risk associated with either model if used on stand alone basis discussed above the asset group for umbro did not qualify asset held for sale therefore we did not consider potential disposition cost or cumulative translation adjustment in the carrying value of the umbro reporting unit in our fiscal fourth quarter impairment analysis because we are still in the preliminary stage of the divestiture process and have not yet identified potential acquirer or the likely deal structure these method represent our best estimate of the fair value of the umbro business our analysis determined there wa no impairment of intangible asset or goodwill related to umbro if the sale process indicates fair value that is below the current carrying value of the reporting unit an analysis would be required to determine if impairment charge exist at that point table of content fair value measurement for financial asset and liability measured at fair value on recurring basis fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer liability in an orderly transaction with market participant at the measurement date in general and where applicable we use quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability to determine the fair value of our financial instrument this pricing methodology applies to our level investment including treasury security in the absence of active market for identical asset or liability such measurement involve developing assumption based on market observable data including quoted price for similar asset or liability in active market and quoted price for identical or similar asset or liability in market that are not active this pricing methodology applies to our level investment such commercial paper and bond agency security and money market fund level investment are valued using internally developed model with unobservable input asset and liability measured using unobservable input are an immaterial portion of our portfolio majority of our available for sale security are priced by pricing vendor and are generally level or level investment these vendor either provide quoted market price in an active market or use observable input without applying significant adjustment in their pricing observable input include broker quote interest rate and yield curve observable at commonly quoted interval volatility and credit risk our fair value process include control that are designed to ensure appropriate fair value are recorded these control include an analysis of period over period fluctuation and comparison to another independent pricing vendor hedge accounting for derivative we use forward and option contract to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transaction well certain non functional monetary asset and liability when the specific criterion to qualify for hedge accounting ha been met change in the fair value of contract hedging probable forecasted future cash flow are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affect net income in most case this result in gain and loss on hedge derivative being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative one of the criterion for this accounting treatment is that the forward and option contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transaction by their very nature our estimate of anticipated transaction may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transaction when anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decline below hedged level or if it is no longer probable that forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two month period of time thereafter we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over hedged portion of the related hedge contract from other comprehensive income to other expense income net during the quarter in which such change occur we use forward contract to hedge our investment in the net asset of certain international subsidiary to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiary the change in fair value of the forward contract hedging our net investment is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholder equity to the extent effective to offset the foreign currency translation adjustment on those investment the value of our underlying net investment in wholly owned international subsidiary is known at the time hedge is placed the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk accordingly the variability involved in net investment hedge is substantially le than that of other type of hedge transaction and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness we consider on quarterly basis the need to redesignate existing hedge relationship based on change in the underlying net investment should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged level the cumulative change in fair value of the over hedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported directly to earnings in the period in which change occur stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock based compensation on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumption including volatility expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded option on our common stock with term greater than one year along with other factor our decision to use implied volatility wa based on the availability of actively traded option on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trend than historical volatility if factor change and we use different assumption for estimating stock based compensation expense in future period stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period tax we record valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset when necessary realization of deferred tax asset such net operating loss carry forward is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we ass the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset which increase our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made in addition we have not recorded income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the thus reducing our overall income tax expense the amount of earnings designated indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore asset and our expectation of the future cash need of our and foreign entity income tax consideration are also factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore we carefully review all factor that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standard to overcome the presumption of repatriation despite this approach because the determination involves our future plan and expectation of future event the possibility exists that amount declared indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated for instance the actual cash need of our entity may exceed our current expectation or the actual cash need of our foreign entity may be le than our current expectation this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amount were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore conversely our approach may also result in determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which income tax have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore in this case our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination on an interim basis we estimate our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year this estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year to date pre tax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual item to determine the year to date tax expense the income tax effect of infrequent or unusual item are recognized in the interim period in which they occur the fiscal year progress we continually refine our estimate based upon actual event and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically result in change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs on quarterly basis we reevaluate the probability that tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax position based on factor including change in fact or circumstance change in tax law settled audit issue and new audit activity change in our assessment may result in the recognition of tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment change we recognize interest and penalty related to income tax matter in income tax expense table of content other contingency in the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceeding regarding contractual and employment relationship product liability claim trademark right and variety of other matter we record contingent liability resulting from claim against including related legal cost when loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable assessing probability of loss and estimating probable loss requires analysis of multiple factor including in some case judgment about the potential action of third party claimant and court recorded contingent liability are based on the best information available and actual loss in any future period are inherently uncertain if future adjustment to estimated probable future loss or actual loss exceed our recorded liability for such claim we would record additional charge other expense income net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred in addition to contingent liability recorded for probable loss we disclose contingent liability when there is reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability while we can not predict the outcome of pending legal matter with certainty we do not believe any currently identified claim proceeding or litigation either individually or in aggregate will have material impact on our result of operation financial position or cash flow table of content item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business and consistent with established policy and procedure we employ variety of financial instrument to manage exposure to fluctuation in the value of foreign currency and interest rate it is our policy to utilize these financial instrument only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposure we do not enter into these transaction for speculative purpose we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation primarily result of our international sale product sourcing and funding activity our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effect of currency fluctuation on our consolidated result of operation financial position and cash flow we use forward exchange contract and option to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transaction well certain firm commitment and the related receivables and payable including third party and intercompany transaction we also use forward contract to hedge our investment in the net asset of certain international subsidiary to offset foreign currency translation adjustment related to our net investment in those subsidiary where hedged our program ha the effect of delaying the impact of current market rate on our consolidated financial statement dependent upon hedge horizon when we begin hedging exposure the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market condition generally all anticipated and firmly committed transaction that are hedged are to be recognized within to month the majority of the contract expiring in more than month relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory when intercompany loan are hedged it is typically for their expected duration hedged transaction are principally denominated in euro british pound and japanese yen see section foreign currency exposure and hedging practice under item for additional detail our earnings are also exposed to movement in short and long term market interest rate our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate change on earnings and cash flow and to reduce overall borrowing cost to achieve these objective we maintain mix of commercial paper bank loan and fixed rate debt of varying maturity and have entered into receive fixed pay variable interest rate swap market risk measurement we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivative using variety of technique including review of market value sensitivity analysis and value at risk var our market sensitive derivative and other financial instrument are foreign currency forward contract foreign currency option contract interest rate swap intercompany loan denominated in non functional currency fixed interest rate dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instrument only the var determines the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate sensitive financial instrument the var model estimate assume normal market condition and confidence level there are various modeling technique that can be used in the var computation our computation are based on interrelationship between currency and interest rate variance co variance technique these interrelationship are function of foreign exchange currency market change and interest rate change over the preceding one year period the value of foreign currency option doe not change on one to one basis with change in the underlying currency rate we adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the delta and gamma to change in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuation on the derivative instrument only and doe not include the impact of such rate fluctuation on non functional currency transaction such anticipated transaction firm commitment cash balance and account and loan receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instrument the var model is risk analysis tool and doe not purport to represent actual loss in fair value that we will incur nor doe it consider the potential effect of favorable change in market rate it also doe not represent the full extent of the

development cost of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed an integral part of product are subject to capitalization beginning when product technological feasibility ha been established and ending when product is available for general release to customer in most instance the company product are released soon after technological feasibility ha been established therefore cost incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant and generally most software development cost have been expensed incurred impairment of long lived asset the company review the carrying value of long lived asset or asset group to be used in operation whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of the asset might not be recoverable factor that would necessitate an impairment assessment include significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used significant adverse change in legal factor or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such fact indicate potential impairment the company would ass the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable the company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodology which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flow any impairment would be measured the difference between the asset group carrying amount and it estimated fair value identifiable intangible asset and goodwill the company performs annual impairment test on goodwill and intangible asset with indefinite life in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when event occur or circumstance change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below it carrying value event or change in circumstance that may trigger interim impairment review include significant change in business climate operating result planned investment in the reporting unit planned divestiture or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among other factor the impairment test requires the company to estimate the fair value of it reporting unit if the carrying value of reporting unit exceeds it fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and the company proceeds to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis the company measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over it implied fair value if any the company generally base it measurement of the fair value of reporting unit on blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flow and the market valuation approach the discounted cash flow model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flow that the company expects the reporting unit to generate in the future the company significant estimate in the discounted cash flow model include it weighted average cost of capital long term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit business and working capital effect the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded company in similar line of business significant estimate in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar company with comparable business factor such size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiple in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit indefinite lived intangible asset primarily consist of acquired trade name and trademark in measuring the fair value for these intangible asset the company utilizes the relief from royalty method this method assumes that trade name and trademark have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalty for the benefit received from them this method requires the company to estimate the future revenue for the related brand the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital on may the company announced it intention to divest of the cole haan and umbro business of may cole haan had no goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset on the company balance sheet while umbro had million of goodwill and million of trademark and other intangible asset of may both asset group for cole haan and umbro did not quality asset held for sale under applicable accounting guidance the decision to divest these business wa deemed triggering event to perform an impairment analysis of umbro intangible asset at that date and wa considered in the company fourth quarter impairment analysis the company is currently in the process of preparing the business for divestiture and identifying potential acquirer therefore the company belief the weighted use of discounted cash flow and the market valuation approach is the best method for determining the fair value of the umbro reporting unit because these are the most common valuation methodology used within it industry and the blended use of both model compensates for the inherent risk associated with either model if used on stand alone basis discussed above the asset group for umbro did not qualify asset held for sale therefore the company did not consider potential disposition cost or cumulative translation adjustment in the carrying value of the umbro reporting unit in it fiscal fourth quarter impairment analysis because the company is still in the preliminary stage of table of content the divestiture process and ha not yet identified potential acquirer or the likely deal structure these method represent management best estimate of the fair value of the umbro business the company analysis determined there wa no impairment of intangible asset or goodwill related to umbro if the sale process indicates fair value that is below the current carrying value of the reporting unit an analysis would be required to determine if impairment charge exist at that point

transfer liability in an orderly transaction with market participant at the measurement date the company us three level hierarchy established by the fasb that prioritizes fair value measurement based on the type of input used for the various valuation technique market approach income approach and cost approach the level of hierarchy are described below level observable input such quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level input other than quoted price that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly these include quoted price for similar asset or liability in active market and quoted price for identical or similar asset or liability in market that are not active level unobservable input in which there is little or no market data available which require the reporting entity to develop it own assumption the company assessment of the significance of particular input to the fair value measurement in it entirety requires judgment and considers factor specific to the asset or liability financial asset and liability are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement pricing vendor are utilized for certain level or level investment these vendor either provide quoted market price in an active market or use observable input without applying significant adjustment in their pricing observable input include broker quote interest rate and yield curve observable at commonly quoted interval volatility and credit risk the company fair value
