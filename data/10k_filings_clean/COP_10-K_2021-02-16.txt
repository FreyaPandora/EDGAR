to the sec alternatively you may access these report at the sec website at www sec gov item risk factor you should carefully consider the following risk factor in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form these risk factor are not the only risk we face our business could also be affected by additional risk and uncertainty not currently known to or that we currently consider to be immaterial if any of these risk or other risk that are yet unknown were to occur our business operating result and financial condition well the value of an investment in our common stock could be adversely affected risk related to our industry we have been negatively affected and may continue to be negatively affected by the prolonged drop in commodity price that began in early the oil and gas business is fundamentally commodity business and our revenue operating result and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the price we receive for crude oil bitumen natural gas ngls and lng such price can fluctuate widely depending upon global event or condition that affect supply and demand most of which are out of our control since early there ha been precipitous decrease in demand for oil globally largely caused by the dramatic decrease in travel and commerce resulting from the covid pandemic see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation for additional information on commodity price and how we have been impacted there is no assurance of when or if commodity price will return to pre covid level and if they do return to pre covid level how long they will remain at those level the speed and extent of any recovery remains uncertain and is subject to various risk factor including the duration impact and action taken to stem the proliferation of the covid pandemic the extent to which those nation party to the opec plus production agreement decide to increase production of crude oil bitumen natural gas and ngls and other factor described herein even after recovery our industry will continue to be exposed to the effect of changing commodity price given the volatility in commodity price driver and the worldwide political and economic environment generally well continued uncertainty caused by armed hostility in various oil producing region around the globe lower crude oil bitumen natural gas ngl and lng price may have material adverse effect on our revenue earnings cash flow and liquidity and may also affect the amount of dividend we elect to declare and pay on our common stock result of the oil market downturn that began in early we suspended our share repurchase program lower price may also limit the amount of reserve we can produce economically thus adversely affecting our proved reserve and reserve replacement ratio and accelerating the reduction in our existing reserve level we continue production from upstream field prolonged depressed crude oil price may affect certain decision related to our operation including decision to reduce capital investment or curtail operated production significant reduction in crude oil bitumen natural gas ngls and lng price could also require to reduce our capital expenditure impair the carrying value of our asset or discontinue the classification of certain asset proved reserve in we recognized several impairment which are described in note suspended well and exploration expense and note impairment in the note to consolidated financial statement due to change in assumption for commodity price and development plan if the outlook for commodity price remains low relative to historic level and we continue to optimize our investment and exercise capital flexibility it is reasonably likely we will incur future impairment to long lived asset used in operation investment in nonconsolidated entity accounted for under the equity method and unproved property if oil and gas price persist at depressed level our reserve estimate may decrease further which could incrementally increase the rate used to determine dd expense on our unit of production method property see item management discussion and analysis for further examination of dd rate impact versus comparative period although it is not reasonably practicable to quantify the impact of any future impairment or estimated change to our unit of production rate at this time our result of operation could be adversely affected result our business ha been and will continue to be adversely affected by the coronavirus covid pandemic the covid pandemic and the measure put in place to address it have negatively impacted the global economy disrupted global supply chain reduced global demand for oil and gas and created significant volatility and disruption of financial and commodity market according to the national bureau of economic research result of the pandemic and it broad reach across the entire economy the entered recession in early and the timing pace and extent of the recovery is still unknown public health official have recommended or mandated certain precaution to mitigate the spread of covid including limiting non essential gathering of people ceasing all non essential travel and issuing social or physical distancing guideline shelter in place order and mandatory closure or reduction in capacity for non essential business although some of these limitation and mandate have been relaxed in certain jurisdiction others have been reinstated in area that have experienced resurgence of covid case in addition despite approval of vaccine to immunize covid the speed at which such vaccination will be available to the public the public willingness to be inoculated and the effectiveness of the vaccine including to variant still remain unknown result the full impact of the covid pandemic remains uncertain and will depend on the severity location and duration of the effect and spread of the disease the effectiveness and duration of action taken by authority to contain the virus or treat it effect the availability and effectiveness of vaccine or other treatment and how quickly and to extent economic condition improve we have already been impacted by the covid pandemic see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation for additional information on how we have been impacted and the step we have taken in response our business is likely to continue to be further negatively impacted by the covid pandemic these impact could include but are not limited to continued reduced demand for our product result of prolonged reduction in travel and commerce even if restriction are lifted disruption in our supply chain due in part to scrutiny or embargoing of shipment from infected area or invocation of force majeure clause in commercial contract due to restriction imposed result of the global response to the pandemic failure of third party on which we rely including our supplier contract manufacturer contractor joint venture partner and external business partner to meet their obligation to the company or significant disruption in their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulty or restriction imposed in response to the disease outbreak reduced workforce productivity caused by but not limited to illness travel restriction quarantine or government mandate business interruption resulting from portion of our workforce continuing to telecommute well the implementation and maintenance of protection for employee commuting for work such personnel screening and self quarantine before or after travel and voluntary or involuntary curtailment to support oil price or alleviate storage shortage for our product any of these factor or other cascading effect of the covid pandemic that are not currently foreseeable could materially increase our cost negatively impact our revenue and damage our financial condition result of operation cash flow and liquidity position despite the rollout of vaccine the pandemic continues to progress and evolve and the full extent and duration of any such impact can not be predicted at this time of the sweeping impact of the covid pandemic on daily life around the world and lack of certainty to if or when condition will return to pre covid level unless we successfully add to our existing proved reserve our future crude oil bitumen natural gas and ngl production will decline resulting in an adverse impact to our business the rate of production from upstream field generally decline reserve are depleted if we do not conduct successful exploration and development activity or through engineering study optimize production performance or identify additional or secondary recovery reserve our proved reserve will decline materially we produce crude oil bitumen natural gas and ngls and our business will experience reduced cash flow and result of operation any cash conservation effort we may undertake result of commodity price decline may further limit our ability to replace depleted reserve the exploration and production of oil and gas is highly competitive industry the exploration and production of crude oil bitumen natural gas and ngls is highly competitive business we compete with private public and state owned company in all facet of the exploration and production business including to locate and obtain new source of supply and to produce crude oil bitumen natural gas and ngls in an efficient cost effective manner some of our competitor are larger and have greater resource than we do or may be willing to incur higher level of risk than we are willing to incur to obtain potential source of supply in addition we may be at competitive disadvantage when competing with state owned company if they are motivated by political or other factor in making their business decision with le emphasis on financial return if we are not successful in our competition for new reserve our financial condition and result of operation may be adversely affected any material change in the factor and assumption underlying our estimate of crude oil bitumen natural gas and ngl reserve could impair the quantity and value of those reserve our proved reserve information included in this annual report represents management best estimate based on assumption of specified date of the volume to be recovered from underground accumulation of crude oil bitumen natural gas and ngls such volume can not be directly measured and the estimate and underlying assumption used by management are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty any material change in the factor and assumption underlying our estimate of these item could result in material negative impact to the volume of reserve reported or could cause to incur impairment expense on property associated with the production of those reserve future reserve revision could also result from change in among other thing governmental regulation our business may be adversely affected by price control government imposed limitation on production of crude oil bitumen natural gas and ngls or the unavailability of adequate gathering processing compression transportation and pipeline facility and equipment for our production of crude oil bitumen natural gas and ngls discussed herein our operation are subject to extensive governmental regulation from time to time regulatory agency have imposed price control and limitation on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil bitumen natural gas and ngl well below actual production capacity because legal requirement are frequently changed and subject to interpretation we can not predict whether future restriction on our business may be enacted or become applicable to our ability to sell and deliver the crude oil bitumen natural gas ngls and lng that we produce also depends on the availability proximity and capacity of gathering processing compression transportation and pipeline facility and equipment well any necessary diluent to prepare our crude oil bitumen natural gas ngls and lng for transport the facility equipment and diluent we rely on may be temporarily unavailable to due to market condition extreme weather event regulatory reason mechanical reason or other factor or condition many of which are beyond our control in addition in certain newer play the capacity of necessary facility equipment and diluent may not be sufficient to accommodate production from existing and new well and construction and permitting delay permitting cost and regulatory or other constraint could limit or delay the construction manufacture or other acquisition of new facility and equipment if any facility equipment or diluent or any of the transportation method and channel that we rely on become unavailable for any period of time we may incur increased cost to transport our crude oil bitumen natural gas ngls and lng for sale or we may be forced to curtail our production of crude oil bitumen natural gas or ngls our investment in joint venture decrease our ability to manage risk we conduct many of our operation through joint venture in which we may share control with our joint venture partner there is risk our joint venture participant may at any time have economic business or legal interest or goal that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or or our joint venture partner may be unable to meet their economic or other obligation and we may be required to fulfill those obligation alone failure by or an entity in which we have joint venture interest to adequately manage the risk associated with any operation acquisition or disposition could have material adverse effect on the financial condition or result of operation of our joint venture and in turn our business and operation our operation present hazard and risk that require significant and continuous oversight the scope and nature of our operation present variety of significant hazard and risk including operational hazard and risk such explosion fire crude oil spill severe weather geological event labor dispute armed hostility terrorist attack sabotage civil unrest or cyber attack our operation may also be adversely affected by unavailability interruption or accident involving service or infrastructure required to develop produce process or transport our production such contract labor drilling rig pipeline railcar tanker barge or other infrastructure our operation are subject to the additional hazard of pollution release of toxic gas and other environmental hazard and risk offshore activity may pose incrementally greater risk because of complex subsurface condition such higher reservoir pressure water depth and metocean condition all such hazard could result in loss of human life significant property and equipment damage environmental pollution impairment of operation substantial loss to and damage to our reputation further our business and operation may be disrupted if we do not respond or are perceived not to respond in an appropriate manner to any of these hazard and risk or any other major crisis or if we are unable to efficiently restore or replace affected operational component and capacity legal and regulatory risk we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditure and operating cost result of our compliance with existing and future environmental law and regulation our business is subject to numerous law and regulation relating to the protection of the environment which are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operation for description of the most significant of these environmental law and regulation see the contingency environmental and contingency climate change section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation these law and regulation continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operation with respect to among other thing permit required in connection with exploration drilling production and other activity including those issued by national subnational and local authority the discharge of pollutant into the environment emission into the atmosphere such nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide mercury and ghg emission carbon tax the handling use storage transportation disposal and cleanup of hazardous material and hazardous and nonhazardous waste the dismantlement abandonment and restoration of our property and facility at the end of their useful life and exploration and production activity in certain area such offshore environment arctic field oil sand reservoir and unconventional play we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditure result of these law and regulation any failure by to comply with existing or future law regulation and other requirement could result in administrative or civil penalty criminal fine other enforcement action or third party litigation against to the extent these expenditure with all cost are not ultimately reflected in the price of our product and service our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow in future period could be materially adversely affected existing and future law regulation and internal initiative relating to global climate change such limitation on ghg emission may impact or limit our business plan result in significant expenditure promote alternative us of energy or reduce demand for our product continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change ha resulted in both existing and pending international agreement and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measure to limit ghg emission such cap and trade regime carbon tax restrictive permitting increased fuel efficiency standard and incentive or mandate for renewable energy for example in december the joined the international community at the conference of the party of the united nation framework convention on climate change in paris that prepared an agreement requiring member country to review and represent progression in their intended ghg emission reduction goal every five year beginning in while the previously withdrew from the paris agreement the new administration ha recommitted the united state to the paris agreement and significant number of state and local government and major corporation headquartered in the have also announced their intention to satisfy these commitment in addition our operation continue in country around the world which are party to and have not announced an intent to withdraw from the paris agreement the implementation of current agreement and regulatory measure well any future agreement or measure addressing climate change and ghg emission may adversely impact the demand for our product impose tax on our product or operation or require to purchase emission credit or reduce emission of ghgs from our operation result we may experience decline in commodity price or incur substantial capital expenditure and compliance operating maintenance and remediation cost any of which may have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation in october we announced the adoption of paris aligned climate risk framework whereby we committed to reduction of our gross operated scope and emission intensity with an ambition to achieve net zero by from operated emission we also endorsed the world bank zero routine flaring by initiative with an ambition to meet that goal by and reaffirmed our commitment to advocate for reduction of scope emission intensity through our support for carbon price compliance with and achievement of climate change related internal initiative such the foregoing may increase cost require to purchase emission credit or limit or impact our business plan potentially resulting in the reduction to the economic end of field life of certain asset and an impairment of the associated net book value increasing attention to global climate change ha also resulted in pressure upon stockholder financial institution and or financial market to modify their relationship with oil and gas company and to limit investment and or funding to such company for example in norway government pension fund announced it would reduce it investment exposure to company that explore for oil and gas and in number of major financial institution announced that they would no longer finance oil and gas exploration project in the arctic public pressure continues to mount our access to capital on term we find favorable if it is available at all may be limited and our cost may increase or our business and result of operation may be otherwise adversely affected furthermore increasing attention to global climate change ha resulted in an increased likelihood of governmental investigation and private litigation which could increase our cost or otherwise adversely affect our business beginning in city county government and other entity in several state in the have filed lawsuit against oil and gas company including conocophillips seeking compensatory damage and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impact additional lawsuit with similar allegation are expected to be filed the amount claimed by plaintiff are unspecified and the legal and factual issue involved in these case are unprecedented conocophillips belief these lawsuit are factually and legally meritless and are an inappropriate vehicle to address the challenge associated with climate change and will vigorously defend against such lawsuit the ultimate outcome and impact to can not be predicted with certainty and we could incur substantial legal cost associated with defending these and similar lawsuit in the future in addition although we design and operate our business operation to accommodate expected climatic condition to the extent there are significant change in the earth climate such more severe or frequent weather condition in the market where we operate or the area where our asset reside we could incur increased expense our operation could be adversely impacted and demand for our product could fall for more information on legislation or precursor for possible regulation relating to global climate change that affect or could affect our operation and description of the company response see the contingency climate change section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation domestic and worldwide political and economic development could damage our operation and materially reduce our profitability and cash flow action of the state local and foreign government through sanction tax and other legislation executive order and commercial restriction could reduce our operating profitability both in the and abroad in certain location restriction on our operation special tax or tax assessment and payment transparency regulation that could require to disclose competitively sensitive information or might cause to violate non disclosure law of other country have been imposed or proposed by government or certain interest group for example in ballot initiative known the fair share act wa proposed in the state of alaska which if enacted would have increased the state share of production revenue and required producer to publicly disclose additional financial information although ultimately defeated similar initiative may be proposed and may be successful in the future the change in control of congress and the white house because of the election increase the possibility of the promulgation of more stringent regulation of our operation and the enactment of tax law change that may adversely affect the fossil fuel industry in addition the current administration may use the congressional review act to repeal the regulation finalized in the last five month of the prior administration we also can not rule out the possibility of similar regulatory shift and attendant cost and market access implication in other international jurisdiction one area subject to significant political and regulatory activity is the use of hydraulic fracturing an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formation range of local state federal and national law and regulation currently govern or in some hydraulic fracturing operation prohibit hydraulic fracturing in some jurisdiction although hydraulic fracturing ha been conducted safely for many decade number of new law regulation and permitting requirement are under consideration which could result in increased cost operating restriction operational delay or could limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resource certain jurisdiction in which we operate have adopted or are considering regulation that could impose new or more stringent permitting disclosure or other regulatory requirement on hydraulic fracturing or other oil and natural gas operation including subsurface water disposal on january the new administration signed an executive order directing the secretary of the interior to stop issuing new oil and gas lease on federal land allowing time to review and reset the federal government oil and gas leasing program existing production and permit already issued on federal land were not impacted by this order if this temporary moratorium were to be extended indefinitely we believe we can mitigate the impact for considerable period of time with our current permit and adjusting our development plan across our diverse acreage position in addition certain interest group have also proposed ballot initiative and constitutional amendment designed to restrict oil and natural gas development generally and hydraulic fracturing in particular in the event that ballot initiative local state or national restriction or prohibition are adopted and result in more stringent limitation on the production and development of oil and natural gas in area where we conduct operation we may incur significant cost to comply with such requirement or may experience delay or curtailment in the permitting or pursuit of exploration development or production activity such compliance cost and delay curtailment limitation or prohibition could have material adverse effect on our business prospect result of operation financial condition and liquidity the government can also prevent or restrict from business in foreign country these restriction and those of foreign government have in the past limited our ability to operate in or gain access to opportunity in various country action by host government such the expropriation of our oil asset by the venezuelan government have affected operation significantly in the past and may continue to do so in the future change in domestic and international policy and regulation may affect our ability to collect payment such those pertaining to the settlement with pdvsa or the icsid award against the government of venezuela or to obtain or maintain permit including those necessary for drilling and development of well in various location similarly the declaration of climate emergency could result in action to limit export of our product and other restriction local political and economic factor in international market could have material adverse effect on approximately percent of our hydrocarbon production wa derived from production outside the in and percent of our proved reserve of december were located outside the we are subject to risk associated with operation in international market including change in foreign governmental policy relating to crude oil natural gas bitumen ngls or lng pricing and taxation other political economic or diplomatic development including the macro effect of international trade policy and dispute potentially disruptive geopolitical condition and international monetary and currency rate fluctuation in addition some country where we operate lack fully independent judiciary system this coupled with change in foreign law or policy result in lack of legal certainty that expose our operation to increased risk including increased difficulty in enforcing our agreement in those jurisdiction and increased risk of adverse action by local government authority such expropriation risk related to our acquisition of concho combining our business with concho may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefit of the merger which may adversely affect our business result and negatively affect the value of our common stock our acquisition of concho the merger involved the combination of two company which until the completion of the merger operated independent public company the success of the merger will depend on among other thing the ability of our two company to combine our business in manner that add value to shareholder however there can be no assurance that our respective business can be integrated successfully and we will be required to devote significant management attention and resource to the integration process we must achieve the anticipated improvement in free cash flow generation and return and achieve the planned cost saving without adversely affecting current revenue or compromising the disciplined investment philosophy to maximize value for shareholder there are large number of process policy procedure operation and technology and system that must be integrated and although we expect that the elimination of duplicative cost strategic benefit and additional income well the realization of other efficiency related to the integration of the business may offset incremental transaction and merger related cost over time we may encounter difficulty in the integration and any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all it is possible that the integration process could take longer than originally anticipated and could result in the loss of key employee the loss of commercial and vendor partner the disruption of our ongoing business inconsistency in standard control procedure and policy unexpected integration issue and higher than expected integration cost an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefit of the merger and the other transaction contemplated by the merger agreement well any delay encountered in the integration process could have an adverse effect upon the revenue level of expense and operating result of conocophillips which may adversely affect the value of our common stock the market value of our common stock could decline if large amount of our common stock are sold now that the concho acquisition ha been consummated we issued share of conocophillips common stock to former concho stockholder former concho stockholder may decide not to hold the share of conocophillips common stock that they received in the merger and conocophillips stockholder may decide to reduce their investment in conocophillips result of the change to conocophillips investment profile result of the merger other concho stockholder such fund with limitation on their permitted holding of stock in individual issuer may be required to sell the share of conocophillips common stock that they received in the merger such sale of conocophillips common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for conocophillips common stock other risk factor facing our business or operation we may need additional capital in the future and it may not be available on acceptable term or at all we have historically relied primarily upon cash generated by our operation to fund our operation and strategy however we have also relied from time to time on access to the debt and equity capital market for funding there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available in the future on acceptable term or at all in addition although we anticipate we will be able to repay our existing indebtedness when it matures or in accordance with our stated plan there can be no assurance we will be able to do so our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures or in accordance with our plan will be subject to number of factor including market condition our operating performance investor sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with agreement governing our then outstanding debt if we are unable to generate sufficient fund from operation or raise additional capital for any reason our business could be adversely affected in addition we are regularly evaluated by the major rating agency based on number of factor including our financial strength and condition affecting the oil and gas industry generally we and other industry company have had their rating reduced in the past due to negative commodity price outlook any downgrade in our credit rating or announcement that our credit rating is under review for possible downgrade could increase the cost associated with any additional indebtedness we incur our business may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of or default under our contract with third party with we do business the operation of our business requires to engage in transaction with numerous counterparties operating in variety of industry including other company operating in the oil and gas industry these counterparties may default on their obligation to result of operational failure or lack of liquidity or for other reason including bankruptcy market speculation about the credit quality of these counterparties or their ability to continue performing on their existing obligation may also exacerbate any operational difficulty or liquidity issue they are experiencing particularly it relates to other company in the oil and gas industry result of the volatility in commodity price any default by any of our counterparties may result in our inability to perform our obligation under agreement we have made with third party or may otherwise adversely affect our business or result of operation in addition our right against any of our counterparties result of default may not be adequate to compensate for the resulting harm caused or may not be enforceable at all in some circumstance we may also be forced to incur additional cost we attempt to enforce any right we have against defaulting counterparty which could further adversely impact our result of operation in particular in august we entered into settlement agreement with petrleos de venezuela pdvsa providing for the payment of approximately billion over five year period in connection with an arbitration award issued by the international chamber of commerce icc tribunal in favor of conocophillips on contractual dispute arising from venezuela expropriation of our interest in the petrozuata and hamaca heavy oil venture and other pre expropriation fiscal measure we have collected approximately billion of the billion settlement to date and pdvsa ha defaulted on it remaining payment obligation under this agreement we are therefore incurring additional cost we seek to recover any unpaid amount under the agreement additionally in march an icsid arbitration tribunal issued an award unanimously ordering the government of venezuela to pay conocophillips approximately billion in compensation for the government unlawful expropriation of the company investment in venezuela in conocophillips ha filed request for recognition of the award in several jurisdiction on august the icsid tribunal issued decision rectifying the award and reducing it by approximately million the award now stand at billion plus interest the government of venezuela is seeking annulment of the award before another panel at icsid and annulment proceeding are underway no amount have been collected result of this award yet our ability to declare and pay dividend and repurchase share is subject to certain consideration dividend are authorized and determined by our board of director in it sole discretion and depend upon number of factor including cash available for distribution our result of operation and anticipated future result of operation our financial condition especially in relation to the anticipated future capital need of our property the level of distribution paid by comparable company our operating expense and other factor our board of director deems relevant we expect to continue to pay quarterly dividend to our stockholder however our board

in the note to consolidated financial statement overview the energy landscape changed dramatically in with simultaneous demand and supply shock that drove the industry into severe downturn the demand shock wa triggered by the covid pandemic which continues to have unprecedented social and economic consequence mitigation effort to stop the spread of this highly contagious disease include stay at home order and business closure that caused sharp contraction in economic activity worldwide the supply shock wa triggered by disagreement between opec and russia beginning in early march which resulted in significant supply coming onto the market and an oil price war these dual demand and supply shock caused oil price to collapse we exited the first quarter of we entered the second quarter of prediction of covid driven global oil demand loss intensified with forecast of unprecedented demand decline based on these forecast opec plus nation held an emergency meeting and in april they announced coordinated production cut that wa unprecedented in both it magnitude and duration the opec plus agreement span from may until april with the volume of production cut easing over time additionally non opec plus country including the canada brazil and other country announced organic reduction to production through the release of drilling rig frac crew normal field decline and curtailment despite these planned production decrease the supply cut were not timely enough to overcome significant demand decline future price for april wti closed under barrel for the first time

approached spot price in april for certain north american landlocked grade of crude oil were in the single digit or even negative for particularly remote or low grade crude while waterborne priced crude such brent sold at relative advantage the extreme volatility experienced in the first half of the year settled in the second half of the year with wti crude oil price exiting the year near per barrel since the start of the severe downturn we have closely monitored the market and taken prudent action in response to this situation we entered in position of relative strength with cash and cash equivalent of more than billion short term investment of billion and an undrawn credit facility of billion totaling approximately billion in available liquidity additionally we had several entity and asset sale agreement in place which generated billion in proceeds from disposition during for more information about the sale of our australia west and non core lower asset see note asset acquisition and disposition in the note to consolidated financial statement this relative advantage allowed to be measured in our response to the sudden change in business environment in march we announced an initial set of action to address the downturn and followed up with additional action in april the combined announcement reflected reduction in our operating plan capital of billion reduction to our operating cost of million and suspension of our share repurchase program these action decreased us of cash by approximately billion in we also established framework for evaluating our asset and implementing economic production curtailment considering the weakness in oil price during the second quarter of which resulted in taking an additional significant step of voluntarily curtailing production predominantly from operated north american asset due to our strong balance sheet we were in an advantaged position to forgo some production and cash flow in anticipation of receiving higher cash flow for those volume in the future in the second quarter we curtailed production by an estimated mboed with mboed of the curtailment from the lower mboed from alaska and mboed from our surmont operation in canada the remainder of the second quarter curtailment were primarily in malaysia other industry operator also cut production and development plan and we progressed through the second quarter certain stay at home restriction eased which partially restored lost demand and wti and brent price exited the second quarter around per barrel based on our economic framework we began restoring production from voluntary curtailment in july and with oil stabilizing around per barrel we ended our curtailment program during the third quarter curtailment in the third quarter averaged approximately mboed with mboed attributable to the lower and mboed to surmont in august we acquired additional montney acreage for cash consideration of million after customary post closing adjustment we also assumed million in financing obligation for associated partially owned infrastructure this acquisition consisted primarily of undeveloped property and included net acre in the liquid rich inga fireweed asset montney zone which is directly adjacent to our existing montney position the transaction increased our montney acreage position to approximately net acre with percent working interest see note acquisition and disposition in the note to consolidated financial statement for additional information in october we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend from per share to per

our concho acquisition we ended the year with over billion of liquidity comprised of billion in cash and cash equivalent billion in short term investment and available borrowing under our credit facility of billion our expectation is that commodity price will remain cyclical and volatile and successful business strategy in the industry must be resilient in lower price environment at the same time retaining upside during period of higher price while we are not impervious to current market condition we believe our decisive action over the last several year of focusing on free cash flow generation high grading our asset base lowering the cost of supply of our investment resource portfolio and strengthening our balance sheet have put in strong relative position compared to our independent peer we remain committed to the core principle of our value proposition namely free cash flow generation strong balance sheet commitment to differential return of and on capital and esg leadership our workforce and operation have adjusted to mitigate the impact of the covid pandemic we have operation in remote area with confined space such offshore platform the north slope of alaska curtis island in australia western canada and indonesia where virus could rapidly spread personnel are asked to perform self assessment for symptom of illness each day and when appropriate are subject to more restrictive measure before traveling to and working on location staffing level in certain operating location have been reduced to minimize health risk exposure and increase social distancing portion of our office staff have continued to work successfully remotely with office around the world carefully designing and executing flexible phased reentry following national state and local guideline these mitigation measure have thus far been effective at reducing business operation disruption workforce health and safety remains the overriding driver for our action and we have demonstrated our ability to adapt to local condition warranted the marketing and supply chain side of our business ha also adapted in response to covid our commercial organization managed transportation commitment during our voluntary curtailment program our supply chain function is proactively working with vendor to ensure the continuity of our business operation monitor distressed service and material provider capture deflation opportunity and pursue cost reduction effort we also enhanced our focus on counterparty risk monitoring during this period and requested credit assurance when applicable operationally we remain focused on safely executing the business in production of mboed generated cash provided by operating activity of billion we invested billion into the

excluding libya for wa mboed adjusting for estimated curtailment of approximately mboed closed acquisition and disposition and excluding libya production for would have been mboed decrease of mboed

business environment brent crude oil price averaged per barrel in compared with per barrel in the energy industry ha periodically experienced this type of volatility due to fluctuating supply and demand condition and such volatility may persist for the foreseeable future commodity price are the most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of operating cash flow into our business our strategy is to create value through price cycle by delivering on the foundational principle that underpin our value proposition free cash flow generation strong balance sheet commitment to differential return of and on capital and esg leadership operational and financial factor affecting profitability the focus area we believe will drive our success through the price cycle include free cash flow generation this is core principle of our value proposition our goal is to achieve strong free cash flow by exercising capital discipline controlling our cost and safely and reliably delivering production throughout the price cycle we expect to make capital investment sufficient to sustain production free cash flow provides fund that are available to return to shareholder strengthen the balance sheet to deliver on our priority through the price cycle or reinvest back into the business for future cash flow expansion maintain capital allocation discipline we participate in commodity price driven and capital intensive industry with varying lead time from when an investment decision is made to the time an asset is operational and generates cash flow result we must invest significant capital dollar to explore for new oil and gas field develop newly discovered field maintain existing field and construct pipeline and lng facility we allocate capital across geographically diverse low cost of supply resource base which combined with legacy asset result in low production decline cost of supply is the wti equivalent price that generates percent after tax return on point forward and fully burdened basis fully burdened includes capital infrastructure foreign exchange price related inflation and in setting our capital plan we exercise rigorous approach that evaluates project using this cost of supply criterion which we believe will lead to value maximization and cash flow expansion using an optimized investment pace not production growth for growth sake our cash allocation priority call for the investment of sufficient capital to sustain production and pay the existing dividend additional capital may be allocated toward growth but discipline will be maintained in february we announced operating plan capital for the combined company of billion the plan includes billion to sustain current production and billion for investment in major project primarily in alaska in addition to ongoing exploration appraisal activity the operating plan capital budget of billion is expected to deliver production from the combined company of approximately mmboed in this production guidance excludes libya control cost and expense controlling operating and overhead cost without compromising safety and environmental stewardship is high priority we monitor these cost using various methodology that are reported to senior management monthly on both an absolute dollar basis and per unit basis managing operating and overhead cost is critical to maintaining competitive position in our industry particularly in low commodity price environment the ability to control our operating and overhead cost impact our ability to deliver strong cash from operation in our production and operating expense were percent lower than primarily due to decreased wellwork and transportation cost resulting from production curtailment across our north american operated asset well the absence of cost related to our and australia west divestiture for more information related to our and australia west divestiture see note acquisition and disposition in the note to consolidated financial statement at the time of the concho acquisition announcement in october we announced planned cost reduction and quantified million of annual expense saving expected to be achieved by these reduction included approximately million due to streamlining our internal organization to appropriate level given the current industry environment and recent asset sale million of and due to refocused exploration program and million of redundant cost on combined basis related to the concho acquisition subsequent to the transaction announcement we identified million of further cost reduction from the combined company to be achieved by optimize our portfolio in january we completed the acquisition of concho and significantly increased our unconventional portfolio with year of low cost of supply investment the addition of complementary acreage in the delaware and midland basin creates sizeable permian presence to augment our leading unconventional position in the eagle ford and bakken in the lower we added to our unconventional montney position with an asset acquisition that consisted primarily of undeveloped property directly adjacent to our existing acreage these acquisition followed several non core asset sale earlier in the year including australia west in our asia pacific segment and niobrara and waddell ranch in the lower we managed the portfolio well during turbulent year with asset sale entered at the end of generating billion of proceeds from disposition in the first half of followed by opportunistic acquisition of unconventional asset in the second half of after commodity price had dropped we will continue to evaluate our asset to determine whether they compete for capital within our portfolio and will optimize the portfolio necessary directing capital towards the most competitive investment strong balance sheet we believe balance sheet strength is critical in cyclical business such our strong operating performance buffered by solid balance sheet enables to deliver on our priority through the price cycle our priority include execution of our development plan maintaining growing dividend and returning competitive return of capital to shareholder commitment to differential return of and on capital we believe in delivering value to our shareholder via growing sustainable dividend supplemented by additional return of capital including share repurchase in we paid dividend on our common stock of approximately billion and repurchased billion of our common stock combined our dividend and repurchase represented percent of our net cash provided by operating activity since we initiated our current share repurchase program in late we have repurchased million share for billion which represents approximately percent of share outstanding of september of december billion of repurchase authority remained of the billion share repurchase program our board of director had authorized repurchase are made at management discretion at prevailing price subject to market condition and other factor see item risk factor our ability to declare and pay dividend and repurchase share is subject to certain consideration in october we announced that our board of director approved an increase to our quarterly dividend of per share to per share in february we resumed share repurchase after the completion of our concho acquisition esg leadership safety and environmental stewardship including the operating integrity of our asset remain our highest priority and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who ha role in our operation and the community in which we operate we strive to conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global

paris aligned climate risk framework part of our continued leadership in esg excellence this comprehensive climate risk strategy should enable to sustainably meet global energy demand while delivering competitive return through the energy transition we have set target to reduce our gross operated scope and emission intensity by to percent from level by with an ambition to achieve net zero by for operated emission we are advocating for reduction of scope end use emission intensity through our support for carbon price and reaffirmed our commitment to the climate leadership council we have joined the world bank flaring initiative to work towards zero routine flaring of gas by and are the first based oil and gas company to adopt paris aligned climate risk strategy add to our proved reserve base we primarily add to our proved reserve base in three way purchase of increased interest in existing field and acquisition application of new technology and process to improve recovery from existing field successful exploration exploitation and development of new and existing field required by current authoritative guideline the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of it economic life is based on historical month first of month average price and current cost this date estimate when production will end and affect the amount of estimated reserve therefore price and cost level change from year to year the estimate of proved reserve also change generally our proved reserve decrease price decline and increase price rise reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserve net of production divided by our current year production shown in our supplemental reserve table disclosure our reserve replacement wa negative percent in reflecting the impact of lower price which reduced reserve by approximately mmboe our organic reserve replacement which excluded net decrease of mmboe from sale and purchase wa negative percent in in the three year ended december our reserve replacement wa percent primarily impacted by lower price in our organic reserve replacement during the three year ended december which excluded net increase of mmboe related to sale and purchase wa percent access to additional resource may become increasingly difficult commodity price can make project uneconomic or unattractive in addition prohibition of direct investment in some nation national fiscal term political instability competition from national oil company and lack of access to high potential area due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base such the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may or may not allow to replace our production over subsequent year apply technical capability we leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely deliver on our plan technical strength is part of our heritage and allows to economically convert additional resource to reserve achieve greater operating efficiency and reduce our environmental impact companywide we continue to leverage knowledge of technological success across our operation we have embraced the digital

development and technical training through structured development program designed to enhance the technical and functional skill of our employee other factor affecting profitability other significant factor that can affect our profitability include energy commodity price our earnings and operating cash flow generally correlate with industry price level for crude oil and natural gas industry price level are subject to factor external to the company and over which we have no control including but not limited to global economic health supply disruption or fear thereof caused by civil unrest or military conflict action taken by opec and other producing country environmental law tax regulation governmental policy and weather related disruption the following graph depicts the average benchmark price for wti crude oil brent crude oil and henry hub natural gas brent crude oil price averaged per barrel in decrease of percent compared with per barrel in similarly wti crude oil price decreased percent from per barrel in to per barrel in crude oil price were lower due to the dual demand and supply shock the demand shock wa triggered by the covid pandemic which continues to have unprecedented social and economic consequence the supply shock wa triggered by disagreement between opec and russia beginning in early march which resulted in significant supply coming onto the market and created higher inventory level henry hub natural gas price decreased percent from an average of per mmbtu in to per mmbtu in henry hub price were depressed due to high storage level and weak demand our realized bitumen price decreased percent from an average of per barrel in to per barrel in the decrease wa largely driven by weakness in wti reflective of impact from the covid pandemic the wcs differential to wti at hardisty remained fairly flat curtailment order imposed by the alberta government which limited production from the province continued throughout we continue to optimize bitumen price realization through improvement in alternate blend capability which result in lower diluent cost and access to the gulf coast market through rail and pipeline contract our worldwide annual average realized price decreased percent from per boe in to per boe in primarily due to lower realized oil natural gas and bitumen price north america energy supply landscape ha been transformed from one of resource scarcity to one of abundance in recent year the use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in unconventional formation ha led to increased industry actual and forecasted crude oil and natural gas production in the although providing significant short and long term growth opportunity for our company the increased abundance of crude oil and natural gas due to development of unconventional play could also have adverse financial implication to including an extended period of low commodity price production curtailment and delay of plan to develop area such unconventional field should one or more of these event occur our revenue would be reduced and additional asset impairment might be possible impairment we participate in capital intensive industry at time our pp and investment become impaired when for example commodity price decline significantly for long period of time our reserve estimate are revised downward or decision to dispose of an asset lead to write down to it fair value we may also invest large amount of money in exploration which if exploratory drilling prof unsuccessful could lead to material impairment of leasehold value we optimize our asset

foundation allowed to be measured in our response to the sudden change in business environment we exited the first quarter of in response to the oil market downturn that began in early we announced the following capital share repurchase and operating cost reduction we reduced our operating plan capital expenditure by total of billion or approximately thirty five percent of the original guidance we suspended our share repurchase program further reducing cash outlay by approximately billion we also reduced our operating cost by approximately billion or roughly ten percent of the original guidance collectively these action represent reduction in cash us of approximately billion versus the original operating plan considering the weakness in oil price during the second quarter of we established framework for evaluating and implementing economic curtailment which resulted in taking an additional significant step of curtailing production predominantly from operated north american asset due to our strong balance sheet we were in an advantaged position to forgo some production and cash flow in anticipation of receiving higher cash flow for those volume in the future based on our

efficiency timing of startup and major turnaround political instability weather related disruption and the addition of proved reserve through exploratory success and their timely and cost effective development while we actively manage these factor production level can cause variability in cash flow although generally this variability ha not been significant that caused by commodity price to

federal clean water act which governs discharge to water body european union regulation for registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical reach federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund which imposes liability on generator transporter and arranger of hazardous substance at site where hazardous substance release have occurred or are threatening to occur federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra which governs the treatment storage and disposal of solid waste federal oil pollution act of under which owner and

resulting in european emission trading scheme these law and their implementing regulation set limit on emission and in the case of discharge to water establish water quality limit and establish standard and impose obligation for the remediation of release of hazardous substance and hazardous waste they also in most case require permit in association with new or modified operation these permit can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process which can be expensive and time consuming in addition there can be delay associated with notice and comment period and the agency processing of the application many of the delay associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant many state and foreign country where we operate also have or are developing similar environmental law and regulation governing these same type of activity while similar in some case these regulation may impose additional or more stringent requirement that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting product across state and international border the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental law and regulation is neither clearly known easily determinable new standard such air emission standard and water quality standard continue to evolve however environmental law and regulation including those that may arise to address concern about global climate change are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operation in the and in other country in which we operate notable area of potential impact include air emission compliance and remediation obligation in the and canada an example is the use of hydraulic fracturing an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formation range of local state federal or national law and regulation currently govern hydraulic fracturing operation with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdiction although hydraulic fracturing ha been conducted for many decade number of new law regulation and permitting requirement are under consideration by various state environmental agency and others which could result in increased cost operating restriction operational delay and or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resource governmental restriction on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investment we have adopted operating principle that incorporate established industry standard designed to meet or exceed government requirement our practice continually evolve technology improves and regulation change we also are subject to certain law and regulation relating to environmental remediation obligation associated with current and past operation such law and regulation include cercla and rcra and their state equivalent longer term expenditure are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly we occasionally receive request for information or notice of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agency alleging we are potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute on occasion we also have been made party to cost recovery litigation by those agency or by private party these request notice and lawsuit assert potential liability for remediation cost at various site that typically are not owned by but allegedly contain waste attributable to our past operation of december there were site around the in which we were identified potentially responsible party under cercla and comparable state law for most superfund site our potential liability will be significantly le than the total site remediation cost because the percentage of waste attributable to versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible party is relatively low although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal site and frequently so for state site other potentially responsible party at site where we are party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligation and where they have not or where potentially responsible party could not be located our share of liability ha not increased materially many of the site at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agency concerned prior to actual cleanup those potentially responsible normally ass site condition apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation in some instance we may have no liability or attain settlement of liability actual cleanup cost generally occur after the party obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval there are relatively few site where we are major participant and given the timing and amount of anticipated expenditure neither the cost of remediation at those site nor such cost at all cercla site in the aggregate is expected to have material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition expensed environmental cost were million in and are expected to be about million per year in and capitalized environmental cost were million in and are expected to be about million per year in and accrued liability for remediation activity are not reduced for potential recovery from insurer or other third party and are not discounted except those assumed in purchase business combination which we do record on discounted basis many of these liability result from cercla rcra and similar state or international law that require to undertake certain investigative and remedial activity at site where we conduct or once conducted operation or at site where conocophillips generated waste wa disposed the accrual also includes number of site we identified that may require environmental remediation but which are not currently the subject of cercla rcra or other agency enforcement activity the law that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively and regardless of fault the legality of the original activity or the current ownership or control of site if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recovery in the future we may incur significant cost under both cercla and rcra remediation activity vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site depending on the mix of unique site characteristic evolving remediation technology diverse regulatory agency and enforcement policy and the presence or absence of potentially liable third party therefore it is difficult to develop reasonable estimate of future site remediation cost at december our balance sheet included total accrued environmental cost of million compared with million at december for remediation activity in the and canada we expect to incur substantial amount of these expenditure within the next year notwithstanding any of the foregoing and with other company engaged in similar business environmental cost and liability are inherent concern in our operation and product and there can be no assurance that material cost and liability will not be incurred however we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our result of operation or financial position result of compliance with current environmental law and regulation climate change continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change ha resulted in broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international law focusing on ghg reduction these proposed or promulgated law apply or could apply in country where we have interest or may have interest in the future law in this field continue to evolve and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either timetable for implementation or our future compliance cost relating to implementation such law if enacted could have material impact on our result of operation and financial condition example of legislation and precursor for possible regulation that do or could affect our operation include european emission trading scheme ets the program through which many of the eu member state are implementing the kyoto protocol our cost of compliance with the eu ets in wa approximately million before tax the alberta technology innovation and emission reduction tier regulation requires any existing facility with emission equal to or greater than metric tonne of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to meet facility benchmark intensity the total cost of these regulation in wa approximately million the supreme court decision in massachusetts epa ct confirmed that the epa ha the authority to regulate carbon dioxide an air pollutant under the federal clean air act the epa announcement on march published interpretation of regulation that determine pollutant covered by clean air act permitting program fed reg april and the epa and department of transportation joint promulgation of final rule on april that trigger regulation of ghgs under the clean air act may trigger more climate based claim for damage and may result in longer agency review time for development project the epa announcement on january outlining series of step it plan to take to address methane and smog forming volatile organic compound emission from the oil and gas industry the government established goal of reducing the level in methane emission from the oil and gas industry by to percent by carbon tax in certain jurisdiction our cost of compliance with norwegian carbon tax legislation in wa approximately million net share before tax we also incur carbon tax for emission from fossil fuel combustion in our british columbia and alberta operation in canada totaling approximately million net share before tax the agreement reached in paris in december at the conference of the party to the united nation framework convention on climate change setting out process for achieving global emission reduction the new administration ha recommitted the united state to the paris agreement and significant number of state and local government and major corporation headquartered in the have also announced related commitment in the some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state level with respect to ghg emission such regulation could take any of several form that may result in the creation of additional cost in the form of tax the restriction of output investment of capital to maintain compliance with law and regulation or required acquisition or trading of emission allowance we are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operation compliance with change in law and regulation that create ghg tax emission trading scheme or ghg reduction policy could significantly increase our cost reduce demand for fossil energy derived product impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation such law and regulation could also increase demand for le carbon intensive energy source including natural gas the ultimate impact on our financial performance either positive or negative will depend on number of factor including but not limited to whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted the timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation the nature of the legislation such cap and trade system or tax on emission or regulation the price placed on ghg emission either by the market or through tax the ghg reduction required the price and availability of offset the amount and allocation of allowance technological and scientific development leading to new product or service any potential significant physical effect of climate change such increased severe weather event change in sea level and change in temperature whether and the extent to which increased compliance cost are ultimately reflected in the price of our product and service climate change litigation beginning in governmental and other entity in several state in the have filed lawsuit against oil and gas company including conocophillips seeking compensatory damage and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impact additional lawsuit with similar allegation are expected to be filed the amount claimed by plaintiff are unspecified and the legal and factual issue involved in these case are unprecedented conocophillips belief these lawsuit are factually and legally meritless and are an inappropriate vehicle to address the challenge associated with climate change and will vigorously defend against such lawsuit several louisiana parish and the state of louisiana have filed lawsuit under louisiana state and local coastal resource management act slcrma against oil and gas company including conocophillips seeking compensatory damage for contamination and erosion of the louisiana coastline allegedly caused by historical oil and gas operation conocophillips entity are defendant in of the lawsuit and will vigorously defend against them because plaintiff slcrma theory are unprecedented there is uncertainty about these claim both to scope and damage and any potential financial impact on the company company response to climate related risk the company ha responded by putting in place sustainable development risk management standard covering the assessment and registering of significant and high sustainable development risk based on their consequence and likelihood of occurrence we have developed company wide climate change action plan with the goal of tracking mitigation activity for each climate related risk included in the corporate sustainable development risk register the risk addressed in our climate change action plan fall into four broad category ghg related legislation and regulation ghg emission management physical climate related impact climate related disclosure and reporting emission are categorized into three different scope gross operated scope and scope ghg emission help understand our climate transition risk scope emission are direct ghg emission from source that we own or control scope emission are ghg emission from the generation of purchased electricity or steam that we consume scope emission are indirect emission from source that we neither own nor control we announced in october the adoption of paris aligned climate risk framework with the objective of implementing coherent set of choice designed to facilitate the success of our existing exploration and production business through the energy transition given the uncertainty remaining about how the energy transition will evolve the strategy aim to be robust across range of potential future outcome the strategy is comprised of four pillar target our target framework consists of hierarchy of target from long term ambition that set the direction and aim of the strategy to medium term performance target for ghg emission intensity to shorter term target for flaring and methane intensity reduction these performance target are supported by lower level internal business unit goal to enable the company to achieve the company wide target we have set target to reduce our gross operated scope and emission intensity by to percent from level by with an ambition to achieve net zero operated emission by we have joined the world bank flaring initiative to work towards zero routine flaring of gas by technology choice we expanded our marginal abatement cost curve process to provide broader range of opportunity for emission reduction technology portfolio choice our corporate authorization process requires all qualifying project to include ghg price in their project approval economics different ghg price are used depending on the region or jurisdiction project in jurisdiction with existing ghg pricing regime incorporate the existing ghg price and forecast into their economics project where no existing ghg pricing regime exists utilize scenario forecast from our internally consistent world energy model in this way both existing and emerging regulatory requirement are considered in our decision making the company doe not use an estimated market cost of ghg emission when assessing reserve in jurisdiction without existing ghg regulation external engagement our external engagement aim to differentiate conocophillips within the oil and gas sector with our approach to managing climate related risk we are founding member of the climate leadership council clc an international policy institute founded in collaboration with business and environmental interest to develop carbon dividend plan participation in the clc provides another opportunity for ongoing dialogue about carbon pricing and framing the issue in alignment with our public policy principle we also belong to and fund american for carbon dividend the education and advocacy branch of the clc critical accounting estimate the preparation of financial statement in conformity with gaap requires management to select appropriate accounting policy and to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense see note accounting policy in the note to consolidated financial statement for description of our major accounting policy certain of these accounting policy involve judgment and uncertainty to such an extent there is reasonable likelihood materially different amount would have been reported under different condition or if different assumption had been used these critical accounting estimate are discussed with the audit and finance committee of the board of director at least annually we believe the following discussion of critical accounting estimate along with the discussion of deferred tax asset valuation allowance in this report address all important accounting area where the nature of accounting estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matter or the susceptibility of such matter to change oil and gas accounting accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rule unique to the oil and gas industry the acquisition of seismic information prior to the discovery of proved reserve is expensed incurred similar to accounting for research and development cost however leasehold acquisition cost and exploratory well cost are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserve have been recognized property acquisition cost for individually significant leasehold management periodically ass for impairment based on exploration and drilling effort to date for relatively small individual leasehold acquisition cost management exercise judgment and determines percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserve and pool that leasehold information with others in the geographic area for prospect in area with limited or no previous exploratory drilling the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high this judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense this judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leasehold and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively at year end the remaining billion of net capitalized unproved property cost consisted primarily of individually significant leasehold mineral right held in perpetuity by title ownership exploratory well currently being drilled suspended exploratory well and capitalized interest of this amount approximately billion is concentrated in major development area the majority of which are not expected to move to proved property in management periodically ass individually significant leasehold for impairment based on the result of exploration and drilling effort and the outlook for commercialization exploratory cost for exploratory well drilling cost are temporarily capitalized or suspended on the balance sheet pending determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserve have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development if exploratory well encounter potentially economic quantity of oil and gas the well cost remain capitalized on the balance sheet long sufficient progress assessing the reserve and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made the accounting notion of sufficient progress is judgmental area but the accounting rule do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well cost on the expectation future market condition will improve or new technology will be found that would make the development economically profitable often the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserve is dependent on obtaining permit and government or co venturer approval the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control exploratory well cost remain suspended long we are actively pursuing such approval and permit and believe they will be obtained once all required approval and permit have been obtained the project are moved into the development phase and the oil and gas reserve are designated proved reserve for complex exploratory discovery it is not unusual to have exploratory well remain suspended on the balance sheet for several year while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co venturer approval of development plan or seek environmental permitting once determination is made the well not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantity the well cost are expensed dry hole and reported in exploration expense management review suspended well balance quarterly continuously monitor the result of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work and expense the suspended well cost dry hole when it determines the potential field doe not warrant further investment in the near term criterion utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristic and hydrocarbon property expected development cost ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserve fiscal term regulation or contract negotiation and our expected return on investment at year end total suspended well cost were million compared with million at year end for additional information on suspended well including an aging analysis see note suspended well and exploration expense in the note to consolidated financial statement proved reserve engineering estimate of the quantity of proved reserve are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amount because of the judgment involved in developing such information reserve estimate are based on geological and engineering assessment of in place hydrocarbon volume the production plan historical extraction recovery and processing yield factor installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limit the reliability of these estimate at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbon despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimate accounting rule require disclosure of proved reserve estimate due to the importance of these estimate to better understand the perceived value and future cash flow of company operation there are several authoritative guideline regarding the engineering criterion that must be met before estimated reserve can be designated proved our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization ha policy and procedure in place consistent with these authoritative guideline we have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserve held by consolidated company well our share of equity affiliate proved reserve estimate are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant change occur and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field also required by current authoritative guideline the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of it economic life is based on month average price and current cost this date estimate when production will end and affect the amount of estimated reserve therefore price and cost level change from year to year the estimate of proved reserve also change generally our proved reserve decrease price decline and increase price rise our proved reserve include estimated quantity related to pscs reported under the economic interest method well variable royalty regime and are subject to fluctuation in commodity price recoverable operating expense and capital cost if cost remain stable reserve quantity attributable to recovery of cost will change inversely to change in commodity price we would expect reserve from these contract to decrease when product price rise and increase when price decline the estimation of proved developed reserve also is important to the income statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for field serf the denominator in the unit of production calculation of the dd of the capitalized cost for that asset at year end the net book value of productive pp subject to unit of production calculation wa approximately billion and the dd recorded on these asset in wa approximately billion the estimated proved developed reserve for our consolidated operation were billion boe at the end of and billion boe at the end of if the estimate of proved reserve used in the unit of production calculation had been lower by percent across all calculation before tax dd in would have increased by an estimated million impairment long lived asset used in operation are assessed for impairment whenever change in fact and circumstance indicate possible significant deterioration in future cash flow expected to be generated by an asset group if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered recoverability test is performed using management assumption for price volume and future development plan if upon review the sum of the undiscounted cash flow before income tax is le than the carrying value of the asset group the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value and reported impairment in the period in which the determination is made individual asset are grouped for impairment purpose at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flow that are largely independent of the cash flow of other group of asset generally on field by field basis for asset because there usually is lack of quoted market price for long lived asset the fair value of impaired asset is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flow using discount rate and price believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participant or based on multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transaction of similar asset where possible the expected future cash flow used for impairment review and related fair value calculation are based on estimated future production volume commodity price operating cost and capital decision considering all available information at the date of review differing assumption could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period see note impairment in the note to consolidated financial statement for additional information investment in nonconsolidated entity accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment whenever change in the fact and circumstance indicate loss in value ha occurred such evidence of loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount or current fair value le than the investment carrying amount when such condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment carrying value and it estimated fair value when determining whether decline in value is other than temporary management considers factor such the length of time and extent of the decline the investee financial condition and near term prospect and our ability and intention to retain our investment for period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment since quoted market price are usually not available the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flow using discount rate and price believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participant plus market analysis of comparable asset owned by the investee if appropriate differing assumption could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period see the aplng section of note investment loan and long term receivables in the note to consolidated financial statement for additional information asset retirement obligation and environmental cost under various contract permit and regulation we have material legal obligation to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operation at operational site our largest asset removal obligation involve plugging and abandonment of well removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platform around the world well oil and gas production facility and pipeline in alaska the fair value of obligation for dismantling and removing these facility are recorded liability and an increase to pp at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted cost fair value is estimated using present value approach incorporating assumption about estimated amount and timing of settlement and impact of the use of technology estimating future asset removal cost requires significant judgement most of these removal obligation are many year or decade in the future and the contract and regulation often have vague description of what removal practice and criterion must be met when the removal event actually occurs the carrying value of our asset retirement obligation estimate is sensitive to input such asset removal technology and cost regulatory and other compliance consideration expenditure timing and other input into valuation of the obligation including discount and inflation rate which are all subject to change between the time of initial recognition of the liability and future settlement of our obligation normally change in asset removal obligation are reflected in the income statement increase or decrease to dd over the remaining life of the asset however for asset at or nearing the end of their operation well previously sold asset for which we retained the asset removal obligation an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings because any increase in pp due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment due to the low fair value of these property in addition to asset removal obligation under the above or similar contract permit and regulation we have certain environmental related project these are primarily related to remediation activity required by canada and various state within the at exploration and production site future environmental remediation cost are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factor the uncertain magnitude of cleanup cost the unknown time and extent of such remedial action that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible party see note asset retirement obligation and accrued environmental cost in the note to consolidated financial statement for additional information projected benefit obligation determination of the projected benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plan are important to the recorded amount for such obligation on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligation and company contribution requirement involves judgment about uncertain future event including estimated retirement date salary level at retirement mortality rate lump sum election rate rate of return on plan asset future health care cost trend rate and rate of utilization of health care service by retiree due to the specialized nature of these calculation we engage outside actuarial firm to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligation and company contribution requirement for employee retirement income security act governed pension plan the actuary exercise fiduciary care on behalf of plan participant in the determination of the judgmental assumption used in determining required company contribution into the plan due to differing objective and requirement between financial accounting rule and the pension plan funding regulation promulgated by governmental agency the actuarial method and assumption for the two purpose differ in certain important respect ultimately we will be required to fund all vested benefit under pension and postretirement benefit plan not funded by plan asset or investment return but the judgmental assumption used in the actuarial calculation significantly affect periodic financial statement and funding pattern over time projected benefit obligation are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligation by million benefit expense is sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan asset assumption basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by million while basis point decrease in the return on plan asset assumption would increase annual benefit expense by million in determining the discount rate we use yield on high quality fixed income investment matched to the estimated benefit cash flow of our plan we are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefit taken from pension plan during the year could exceed the total of service and interest component of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of portion of unrecognized net actuarial loss and gain these benefit payment are based on decision by plan participant and are therefore difficult to predict in the event there is significant reduction in the expected year of future service of present employee or the elimination of the accrual of defined benefit for some or all of their future service for significant number of employee we could recognize curtailment gain or loss see note employee benefit plan in the note to consolidated financial statement for additional information contingency number of claim and lawsuit are made against the company arising in the ordinary course of business management exercise judgment related to accounting and disclosure of these claim which includes loss damage and underpayment associated with environmental remediation tax contract and other legal dispute we learn new fact concerning contingency we reassess our position both with respect to amount recognized and disclosed considering change to the probability of additional loss and potential exposure however actual loss can and do vary from estimate for variety of reason including legal arbitration or other third party decision settlement discussion evaluation of scope of damage interpretation of regulatory or contractual term expected timing of future action and proportion of liability shared with other responsible party estimated future cost related to contingency are subject to change event evolve and additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation process for additional information on contingent liability see the contingency section within capital resource and liquidity and note contingency and commitment in the note to consolidated financial statement income tax we are subject to income taxation in numerous jurisdiction worldwide we record deferred tax asset and liability to account for the expected future tax consequence of event that have been recognized in our financial statement and our tax return we routinely ass our deferred tax asset and reduce such asset by valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in assessing the need for adjustment to existing valuation allowance we consider all available positive and negative evidence positive evidence includes reversal of temporary difference forecast of future taxable income assessment of future business assumption and applicable tax planning strategy that are prudent and feasible negative evidence includes loss in recent year well the forecast of future net income loss in the realizable period in making our assessment regarding valuation allowance we weight the evidence based on objectivity numerous judgment and assumption are inherent in the determination of future taxable income including factor such future operating condition and the assessment of the effect of foreign tax on our federal income tax particularly related to prevailing oil and gas price see note income tax for additional information in the note to consolidated financial statement we regularly ass and if required establish accrual for uncertain tax position that could result from assessment of additional tax by taxing jurisdiction in country where we operate we recognize tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merit of the position these accrual for uncertain tax position are subject to significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on periodic basis in light of changing fact and circumstance considering the progress of ongoing tax audit court proceeding change in

the account or disclosure to which they relate accounting for asset retirement obligation for certain offshore property description of the matter at december the asset retirement obligation aro balance totaled billion further described in note the company record aros in the period in which they are incurred typically when the asset is installed at the production location the estimation of certain obligation related to deepwater offshore asset requires significant judgment given the magnitude of these removal cost and higher estimation uncertainty related to the removal plan and cost furthermore given certain of these asset are nearing the end of their operation the impact of change in these aros may result in material impact to earnings given the relatively short remaining useful life of the asset auditing the company aros for the obligation identified above is complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management in determining the obligation in particular the estimate were sensitive to significant subjective assumption such removal cost estimate and end of field life which are affected by expectation about future market or economic condition how we addressed the matter in our audit we obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the company internal control over it aro estimation process including management review of the significant assumption that have material effect on the determination of the obligation we also tested management control over the completeness and accuracy of the financial data used in the valuation to test the aros for the obligation identified above our audit procedure included among others assessing the significant assumption and input used in the valuation including removal cost estimate and end of field life assumption for example we evaluated removal cost estimate by comparing to settlement and recent removal activity and cost we also compared end of field life assumption to production forecast we involved our internal specialist in testing the company methodology to estimate removal cost depreciation depletion and amortization and impairment of property plant and equipment description of the matter at december the net book value of the company property plant and equipment pp wa billion and depreciation depletion and amortization dd expense and impairment expense were billion and billion respectively for the year then ended described in note under the successful effort method of accounting dd of pp on producing hydrocarbon property and certain pipeline and liquified natural gas asset those which are expected to have declining utilization pattern are determined by the unit of production method the unit of production method us proved oil and gas reserve estimated by the company internal reservoir engineer pp used in operation is assessed by management for impairment when change in fact and circumstance indicate possible significant deterioration in the future cash flow expected to be generated by an asset group if there is an indication the carrying value of an asset may not be recovered the company compare undiscounted cash flow before income tax to the carrying value of the asset group if the expected undiscounted cash flow before income tax are lower than the carrying value of the asset group the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value proved oil and gas reserve estimate are based on geological and engineering assessment of in place hydrocarbon volume the production plan historical extraction recovery and processing yield factor installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limit additionally the expected future cash flow used for impairment review and related fair value calculation are based on future production volume of estimated oil and gas reserve significant judgment is required by the company internal reservoir engineer in evaluating geological and engineering data when estimating oil and gas reserve estimating reserve also requires the selection of input including oil and gas price assumption future operating and capital cost assumption and tax rate by jurisdiction among others because of the complexity involved in estimating oil and gas reserve management also used an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm to perform review of the process and control used by the company internal reservoir engineer to determine estimate of proved oil and gas reserve auditing the company dd and impairment calculation is complex because of the use of the work of the internal reservoir engineer and the independent petroleum engineering consulting firm and the evaluation of management determination of the input described above used by the internal reservoir engineer in estimating oil and gas reserve how we addressed the matter in our audit we obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the company internal control over it process to calculate dd and impairment including management control over the completeness and accuracy of the financial data provided to the internal reservoir engineer for use in estimating oil and gas reserve our audit procedure included among others evaluating the professional qualification and objectivity of the company internal reservoir engineer primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserve estimate and the independent petroleum engineering consulting firm used to review the company process and control in addition in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineer we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the financial data and input described above used by the internal reservoir engineer in estimating oil and gas reserve by agreeing them to source documentation and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence we also tested the accuracy of the dd and impairment calculation including comparing the oil and gas reserve amount used in the calculation to the company reserve report ernst young llp we have served conocophillips auditor since houston

bitumen natural gas lng ngls and other item are recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the asset in evaluating when customer ha control of the asset we primarily consider whether the transfer of legal title and physical delivery ha occurred whether the customer ha significant risk and reward of ownership and whether the customer ha accepted delivery and right to payment exists these product are typically sold at prevailing market price we allocate variable market based consideration to delivery performance obligation in the current period that consideration relates specifically to our effort to transfer control of current period delivery to the customer and represents the amount we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the related product payment is typically due within day or le revenue associated with transaction commonly called buy sell contract in which the purchase and sale of inventory with the same counterparty are entered into in contemplation of one another are combined and reported net on the same income statement line shipping and handling cost we typically incur shipping and handling cost prior to control transferring to the customer and account for these activity fulfillment cost accordingly we include shipping and handling cost in production and operating expense for production activity transportation cost related

control cash equivalent cash equivalent are highly liquid short term investment that are readily convertible to known amount of cash and have original maturity of day or le from their date of purchase they are carried at cost plus accrued interest which approximates fair value short term investment short term investment include investment in bank time deposit and marketable security commercial paper and government obligation which are carried at cost plus accrued interest and have original maturity of greater than day but within one year or when the remaining maturity are within one year we also invest in financial instrument classified available for sale debt security which are carried at fair value those instrument are included in short term investment when they have remaining maturity within one year of the balance sheet date long term investment in debt security long term investment in debt security includes financial instrument classified available for sale debt security with remaining maturity greater than one year of the balance sheet date they are carried at fair value and presented within the investment and long term receivables line of our consolidated balance sheet inventory we have several valuation method for our various type of inventory and consistently use the following method for each type of inventory the majority of our commodity related inventory are recorded at cost using the lifo basis we measure these inventory at the lower of cost or market in the aggregate any necessary lower of cost or market write down at year end are recorded permanent adjustment to the lifo cost basis lifo is used to better match current inventory cost with current revenue cost include both direct and indirect expenditure incurred in bringing an item or product to it existing condition and location but not unusual nonrecurring cost or research and development cost material supply and other miscellaneous inventory such tubular good and well equipment are valued using various method including the weighted average cost method and the fifo method consistent with industry practice fair value measurement asset and liability measured at fair value and required to be categorized within the fair value hierarchy are categorized into one of three different level depending on the observability of the input employed in the measurement level input are quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level input are observable input other than quoted price included within level for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly through market corroborated input level input are unobservable input for the asset or liability reflecting significant modification to observable related market data or our assumption about pricing by market participant derivative instrument derivative instrument are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value if the right of offset exists and certain other criterion are met derivative asset and liability with the same counterparty are netted on the balance sheet and the collateral payable or receivable is netted against derivative asset and derivative liability respectively recognition and classification of the gain or loss that result from recording and adjusting derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative gain and loss from derivative not accounted for hedge are recognized immediately in earnings we do not apply hedge accounting on our derivative instrument oil and gas exploration and development oil and gas exploration and development cost are accounted for using the successful effort method of accounting property acquisition cost oil and gas leasehold acquisition cost are capitalized and included in the balance sheet caption pp leasehold impairment is recognized based on exploratory experience and management judgment upon achievement of all condition necessary for reserve to be classified proved the associated leasehold cost are reclassified to proved property exploratory cost geological and geophysical cost and the cost of carrying and retaining undeveloped property are expensed incurred exploratory well cost are capitalized or suspended on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserve have been found if economically recoverable reserve are not found exploratory well cost are expensed dry hole if exploratory well encounter potentially economic quantity of oil and gas the well cost remain capitalized on the balance sheet long sufficient progress assessing the reserve and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made for complex exploratory discovery it is not unusual to have exploratory well remain suspended on the balance sheet for several year while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co venturer approval of development plan or seek environmental permitting once all required approval and permit have been obtained the project are moved into the development phase and the oil and gas resource are designated proved reserve management review suspended well balance quarterly continuously monitor the result of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work and expense the suspended well cost dry hole when it judge the potential field doe not warrant further investment in the near term see note suspended well and exploration expense for additional information on suspended well development cost cost incurred to drill and equip development well including unsuccessful development well are capitalized depletion and amortization leasehold cost of producing property are depleted using the unit of production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserve amortization of intangible development cost is based on the unit of production method using estimated proved developed oil and gas reserve capitalized interest interest from external borrowing is capitalized on major project with an expected construction period of one year or longer capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying asset and is amortized over the useful life of the asset in the same manner the underlying asset depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization of pp on producing hydrocarbon property and sagd facility and certain pipeline and lng asset those which are expected to have declining utilization pattern are determined by the unit of production method depreciation and amortization of all other pp are determined by either the individual unit straight line method or the group straight line method for those individual unit that are highly integrated with other unit impairment of property plant and equipment pp used in operation are assessed for impairment whenever change in fact and circumstance indicate possible significant deterioration in the future cash flow expected to be generated by an asset group if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered recoverability test is performed using management assumption such for price volume and future development plan if upon review the sum of the undiscounted cash flow before income tax is le than the carrying value of the asset group the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value and reported an impairment in the period in which the determination of the impairment is made individual asset are grouped for impairment purpose at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flow that are largely independent of the cash flow of other group of asset generally on field by field basis for asset because there usually is lack of quoted market price for long lived asset the fair value of impaired asset is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flow using discount rate and price believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participant or based on multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transaction of similar asset where possible long lived asset committed by management for disposal within one year are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value le cost to sell with fair value determined using binding negotiated price if available or present value of expected future cash flow previously described the expected future cash flow used for impairment review and related fair value calculation are based on estimated future production volume price and cost considering all available evidence at the date of review the impairment review includes cash flow from proved developed and undeveloped reserve including any development expenditure necessary to achieve that production additionally when probable and possible reserve exist an appropriate risk adjusted amount of these reserve may be included in the impairment calculation impairment of investment in nonconsolidated entity investment in nonconsolidated entity are assessed for impairment whenever change in the fact and circumstance indicate loss in value ha occurred when such condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value the fair value of the impaired investment is based on quoted market price if available or upon the present value of expected future cash flow using discount rate and price believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participant plus market analysis of comparable asset owned by the investee if appropriate maintenance and repair cost of maintenance and repair which are not significant improvement are expensed when incurred property disposition when complete unit of depreciable property are sold the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated with any gain or loss reflected in the gain on disposition line of our consolidated income statement when le than complete unit of depreciable property are disposed of or retired which do not significantly alter the dd rate the difference between asset cost and salvage value is charged or credited to accumulated depreciation asset retirement obligation and environmental cost the fair value of legal obligation to retire and remove long lived asset are recorded in the period in which the obligation is incurred typically when the asset is installed at the production location fair value is estimated using present value approach incorporating assumption about estimated amount and timing of settlement and impact of the use of technology when the liability is initially recorded we capitalize this cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related pp if in subsequent period our estimate of this liability change we will record an adjustment to both the liability and pp over time the liability is increased for the change in it present value and the capitalized cost in pp is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset reduction to estimated liability for asset that are no longer producing are recorded credit to impairment if the asset had been previously impaired or credit to dd if the asset had not been previously impaired for additional information see note asset retirement obligation and accrued environmental cost environmental expenditure are expensed or capitalized depending upon their future economic benefit expenditure relating to an existing condition caused by past operation and those having no future economic benefit are expensed liability for environmental expenditure are recorded on an undiscounted basis unless acquired through business combination which we record on discounted basis when environmental assessment or cleanup are probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated recovery of environmental remediation cost from other party are recorded asset when their receipt is probable and estimable guarantee the fair value of guarantee is determined and recorded liability at the time the guarantee is given the initial liability is subsequently reduced we are released from exposure under the guarantee we amortize the guarantee liability over the relevant time period if one exists based on the fact and circumstance surrounding each type of guarantee in case where the guarantee term is indefinite we reverse the liability when we have information indicating the liability is essentially relieved or amortize it over an appropriate time period the fair value of our guarantee exposure decline over time we amortize the guarantee liability to the related income statement line item based on the nature of the guarantee when it becomes probable that we will have to perform on guarantee we accrue separate liability if it is reasonably estimable based on the fact and circumstance at that time we reverse the fair value liability only when there is no further exposure under the guarantee share based compensation we recognize share based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period the stated period of time required to earn the award or the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement we have elected to recognize expense on straight line basis over the service period for the entire award whether the award wa granted with ratable or cliff vesting income tax deferred income tax are computed using the liability method and are provided on all temporary difference between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our asset and liability except for deferred tax on income and temporary difference related to the cumulative translation adjustment considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiary and foreign corporate joint venture allowable tax credit are applied currently reduction of the provision for income tax interest related to unrecognized tax benefit is reflected in interest and debt expense and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit are reflected in production and operating expense tax collected from customer and remitted to governmental authority sale and value added tax are recorded net net income loss per share of common stock basic net income loss per share of common stock is calculated based upon the daily weighted average number of common share outstanding during the year also this calculation includes fully vested stock and unit award that have not yet been issued common stock along with an adjustment to net income loss for dividend equivalent paid on unvested unit award that are considered participating security diluted net income per share of common stock includes unvested stock unit or option award granted under our compensation plan and vested but unexercised stock option but only to the extent these instrument dilute net income per share primarily under the treasury stock method diluted net loss per share which is calculated the same basic net loss per share doe not assume conversion or exercise of security that would have an antidilutive effect treasury stock is excluded from the daily weighted average number of common share outstanding in both calculation the earnings per share impact of the participating security is immaterial note change in accounting principle we adopted the provision of fasb asu no measurement of credit loss on financial instrument asc topic and it amendment beginning january this asu amended set forth the current expected credit loss model new forward looking impairment model for certain financial instrument measured at amortized cost basis based on expected loss rather than incurred loss this asu amended which primarily applies to our account receivable also requires credit loss related to available for sale debt security to be recorded through an allowance for credit loss the adoption of this asu did not have material impact to our financial statement the majority of our receivables are due within day or le we monitor the credit quality of our counterparties through review of collection credit rating and other analysis we develop our estimated allowance for credit loss primarily using an aging method and analysis of historical loss rate well consideration of current and future condition that could impact our counterparties credit quality and liquidity note inventory inventory at december were million of dollar crude oil and natural gas and supply inventory valued on the lifo basis totaled

indemnity is in effect if one exists based on the fact and circumstance surrounding each type of indemnity in case where the indemnification term is indefinite we will reverse the liability when we have information the liability is essentially relieved or amortize the liability over an appropriate time period the fair value of our indemnification exposure decline although it is reasonably

related to income tax we accrue liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if range of amount can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is better estimate than any other amount then the low end of the range is accrued we do not reduce these liability for potential insurance or third party recovery we accrue receivables for insurance or other third party recovery when applicable with respect to income tax related contingency we use cumulative probability weighted loss accrual in case where sustaining tax position is le than certain see

exposure will exceed current accrual by an amount that would have material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statement we learn new fact concerning contingency we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liability and other potential exposure estimate particularly sensitive to future change include contingent liability recorded for environmental remediation tax and legal matter estimated future environmental remediation cost are subject to change due to such factor the uncertain magnitude of cleanup cost the unknown time and extent of such remedial action that may be

information becomes available during the administrative and litigation process environmental we are subject to international federal state and local environmental law and regulation when we prepare our consolidated financial statement we record accrual for environmental liability based on management best estimate using all information that is available at the time we measure estimate and base liability on currently available fact existing technology and presently enacted law and regulation taking into account stakeholder and business consideration when measuring environmental liability we also consider our prior experience in remediation of contaminated site other company cleanup experience and data released by the epa or other organization we consider unasserted claim in our determination of environmental liability and we accrue them in the period they are both probable and reasonably estimable although liability of those potentially responsible for environmental remediation cost is generally joint and several for federal site and frequently so for other site we are usually only one of many company cited at particular site due to the joint and several liability we could be responsible for all cleanup cost related to any site at which we have been designated potentially responsible party we have been successful to date in sharing cleanup cost with other financially sound company many of the site at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the agency concerned prior to actual cleanup those potentially responsible normally ass the site condition apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation in some instance we may have no liability or may attain settlement of liability where it appears that other potentially responsible party may be financially unable to bear their proportional share we consider this inability in estimating our potential liability and we adjust our accrual accordingly result of various acquisition in the past we assumed certain environmental obligation some of these environmental obligation are mitigated by indemnification made by others for our benefit and some of the indemnification are subject to dollar limit and time limit we are currently participating in environmental assessment and cleanup at numerous federal superfund and comparable state and international site after an assessment of environmental exposure for cleanup and other cost we make accrual on an undiscounted basis except those acquired in purchase business combination which we

historical month first of month average price and current cost this estimated date when production will end affect the amount of estimated reserve therefore price and cost level change from year to year the estimate of proved reserve also change generally our proved reserve decrease price decline and increase price rise our proved reserve include estimated quantity related to pscs which are reported under the economic interest method well variable royalty regime and are subject to fluctuation in commodity price recoverable operating expense and capital cost if cost remain stable reserve quantity attributable to recovery of cost will change inversely to change in commodity price for example if price increase then our applicable reserve quantity would decline at december approximately percent of our total proved reserve were under pscs located in our asia pacific middle east geographic reporting area and percent of our total proved reserve were under variable royalty regime located in our canada geographic reporting area reserve governance the recording and reporting of proved reserve are governed by criterion established by regulation of the sec and fasb proved reserve are those quantity of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from given date forward from known reservoir and under existing economic condition operating method and government regulation prior to the time at which contract providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic method are used for the estimation the project to extract the hydrocarbon must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain it will commence the project within reasonable time proved reserve are further classified either developed or undeveloped proved developed reserve are proved reserve that can be expected to be recovered through existing well with existing equipment and operating method or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of new well and through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserve estimate if the extraction is by mean not involving well proved undeveloped reserve are proved reserve expected to be recovered from new well on undrilled acreage or from existing well where relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion reserve on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing area that are reasonably certain of production when drilled unless evidence provided by reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distance defined by sec regulation reliable technology may be used in reserve estimation when they have been demonstrated in the field to provide reasonably certain result with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation the technology and data used in the estimation of our proved reserve include but are not limited to performance based method volumetric based method geologic map seismic interpretation well log well test data core data analogy and statistical analysis we have companywide comprehensive sec compliant internal policy that governs the determination and reporting of proved reserve this policy is applied by the geoscientists and reservoir engineer in our business unit around the world part of our internal control
