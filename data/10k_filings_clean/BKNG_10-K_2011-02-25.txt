aggressively throughout our international operation have become more meaningful contributor to our result we have seen and expect to continue to see change in our advertising expense specifically because our international operation utilize internet search engine and online affiliate marketing principally through the purchase of travel related keywords principal mean of generating traffic to their website our online advertising expense ha increased significantly since our acquisition of those company trend we expect to continue throughout competition we compete with both online and traditional seller of the service we offer the market for the service we offer is intensely competitive and current and new competitor can launch new site at relatively low cost we may not be able to effectively compete with industry conglomerate such expedia orbitz worldwide or sabre each of which may have access to significantly greater and more diversified resource than we do we currently or potentially compete with variety of company with respect to each service we offer with respect to our travel service these competitor include but are not limited to internet travel service such expedia hotel com hotwire and venere which are owned by expedia travelocity lastminute com and zuji which are owned by the sabre group orbitz com cheaptickets ebookers hotelclub and ratestogo which are currently owned by orbitz worldwide laterooms and asiarooms owned by tui travel and gulliver octopustravel superbreak hotel de hotel reservation service autoeurope holiday auto car trawler ctrip rakuten and wotif travel supplier such airline hotel company and rental car company many of which have their own branded website to which they drive business large online portal social networking group buying and search company such google yahoo including yahoo travel bing including bing travel facebook and groupon traditional travel agency wholesaler and tour operator online travel search site such kayak com mobissimo com farechase com hotelscombined and sidestep com each sometimes referred to meta search site and travel research site that have search functionality such tripadvisor travelzoo and cheapflights com and operator of travel industry reservation database such galileo travelport amadeus and sabre table of content traditional online travel company have created new promotion and consumer value feature in an effort to gain competitive advantage for example in travelocity launched an opaque price disclosed hotel booking service that allows customer to book room at discount because similar to our name your own price hotel booking service the name of the hotel is not disclosed until after purchase in addition in the fourth quarter of expedia began making opaque hotel room reservation available on it principal website under the name expedia unpublished rate if expedia or travelocity are successful in growing their opaque hotel service our share of the discount hotel market in the could decrease online travel company have also offered consumer value feature such without limitation the elimination and or reduction of processing fee the adoption of best price guarantee and the waiver of cancellation and change fee the elimination of processing fee on retail airline ticket by and our major competitor coupled with the recent significant year over year increase in retail air fare ha led consumer to engage in increased shopping behavior before making purchase increased shopping behavior reduces our advertising efficiency and effectiveness traffic obtained through online advertising becomes le likely to result in purchase on our web site large established internet search engine with substantial resource and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating internet traffic are creating and intend to further create inroad into online travel both in the and internationally for example google recently announced that it ha entered into an agreement to acquire ita software inc major flight information software company which could allow google to pursue the creation of new flight search tool which will enable user to find flight information on the internet without using service like google ha also invested in homeaway vacation home rental service in addition google ha launched travel meta search site to show searcher specific hotel and rate in addition to text advertisement and microsoft ha launched bing travel meta search site which search for airfare and hotel reservation online and predicts the best time to purchase them meta search site leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search result for the searcher specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other website and in many instance compete directly with for customer these initiative among others illustrate google and bing clear intention to more directly appeal to travel consumer by showing consumer more detailed travel search result including specific information for traveler own itinerary which could lead to supplier or others gaining larger share of google or bing traffic or may ultimately lead to search engine maintaining transaction within their own website if google the single largest search engine in the world or bing or other leading search engine refer significant traffic to these or other travel service that they develop in the future it could result in among other thing more competition from supplier website and higher customer acquisition cost for third party site such ours and could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition many airline hotel and rental car supplier including supplier with which we conduct business are focusing on driving online demand to their own website in lieu of third party distributor such certain supplier have attempted to charge additional fee to customer who book airline reservation through an online channel other than their own website furthermore some airline may distribute their ticket exclusively through their own website supplier who sell on their own website typically do not charge processing fee and in some instance offer advantage such web only fare bonus mile or loyalty point which could make their offering more attractive to consumer than model like ours many of our current and potential competitor including internet directory search engine and large traditional retailer have longer operating history larger customer base greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial marketing personnel technical and other resource than we do some of these competitor may be able to secure service on more favorable term than we can in addition many of these competitor may be able to devote significantly greater resource to marketing and promotional campaign attracting traffic to their website table of content attracting and retaining key employee securing vendor and supply and website and system development increased competition could result in reduced operating margin loss of market share and damage to our brand there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully current and future competitor or that competition will not have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition see risk factor intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance operation and technology our business is supported by multiple system platform which were designed with an emphasis on scalability performance and reliability the platform are largely independent among booking com priceline com agoda and traveljigsaw the software platform and architecture use variety of tool within each corporate implementation including server side java asp net and perl and sql script integrated with oracle mysql and microsoft sql servicer relational database system these internal platform were designed to

annual report should be carefully considered the risk and uncertainty described below are not the only one we face additional risk and uncertainty not presently known to may also impair our business operation if any of the following risk occur our business financial condition operating result and cash flow could be materially adversely affected booking com agoda and traveljigsaw face risk related to their growth rate and expansion and subject to risk that can adversely affect our operating result we derive substantial portion of our revenue from and have significant operation outside of the united state our international operation include the netherlands based hotel reservation service booking com the thailand based hotel reservation service agoda and the based rental car reservation service traveljigsaw each year since our international operation achieved significant year over year growth in their gross booking an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value generally inclusive of all tax and fee of all travel service purchased by our customer and hotel room night reservation this growth rate ha contributed significantly to our growth in revenue gross profit and earnings per share over time booking com agoda and traveljigsaw will experience decline in their growth rate the absolute level of their gross booking and unit sale grow larger other factor may also slow the growth rate of our international operation including for example worldwide economic condition any strengthening of the dollar versus the euro decline in hotel average daily rate adrs increase in cancellation travel market condition and the competitiveness of the market decline in the growth rate of our international operation could have negative impact on our future revenue and earnings per share growth rate and consequence our stock price the strategy of booking com agoda and traveljigsaw involves rapid expansion into region around the world including europe asia pacific north america south america and elsewhere many of which have different custom different level of customer acceptance of the internet and different legislation regulatory environment tax law and level of political stability in addition compliance with foreign legal regulatory or tax requirement will place demand on our time and resource and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse legal regulatory or tax consequence if booking com agoda and traveljigsaw are unsuccessful in rapidly expanding into other country our business result of operation and financial condition would be adversely affected we are dependent on the travel industry our financial prospect are significantly dependent upon our sale of travel service travel including hotel room reservation rental car reservation and airline ticket is dependent on discretionary spending level result sale of travel service tend to decline during general economic downturn and recession accordingly the recent worldwide recession led to weakening in the fundamental demand for our service and an increase in the number of customer who cancelled existing travel reservation with in addition unforeseen event beyond our control such terrorist attack unusual weather pattern including natural disaster such hurricane tsunami or earthquake and other weather phenomenon such the volcanic ash cloud that grounded european air travel for several day in april travel related health concern including pandemic and epidemic such influenza swine flu avian bird flu and sars political instability regional hostility increase in fuel price imposition of tax or surcharge by regulatory authority and travel related accident also may adversely affect the travel industry and our business and result of operation further work stoppage or labor unrest at any of the major airline could materially adversely affect the airline industry and consequence have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition for example in early civil unrest in thailand key market for our agoda business and the asian business of booking com negatively impacted booking volume in this market at the time in addition clash involving thai security force anti government demonstrator and group supporting the government resulted in violence in various location in bangkok causing the temporary relocation of agoda thailand based operation thailand ha experienced disruptive civil unrest in prior year table of content well and continued or future civil or political unrest could further disrupt agoda thailand based business and operation we are dependent on certain supplier our arrangement with the hotel airline and rental car supplier that participate in our system either name your own price or price disclosed service generally do not require them to provide any specific quantity of hotel room reservation airline ticket or rental car or to make room reservation ticket or car available for any particular route in any geographic area or at any particular price during the course of our business we are in continuous dialogue with our major supplier about the nature and extent of their participation in our system the significant reduction on the part of any of our major supplier of their participation in our system for sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition during the recent worldwide recession the hotel industry experienced significant decrease in occupancy rate and adrs and an increase in reservation cancellation rate while lower occupancy rate have historically resulted in hotel supplier increasing their distribution of hotel room reservation through third party intermediary such our remuneration for hotel transaction change proportionately with room price and therefore lower adrs generally have negative effect on our hotel business and negative effect on our gross profit in addition certain hotel have begun initiative to reduce margin received by third party intermediary on retail merchant transaction which is the primary method we employ to distribute retail hotel room reservation in the united state many hotel distribute room reservation through their own website and therefore might increase negotiated rate for merchant rate hotel room reservation sold through our merchant price disclosed hotel service decreasing the margin available to while our merchant price disclosed hotel agreement with our leading hotel supplier provide for specified discount if one or more participating hotel were to require to limit our merchant margin upon contract renewal or otherwise it could have an adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition with respect to our airline supplier the airline industry ha experienced shift in market share from full service carrier to low cost carrier that focus primarily on discount fare to leisure destination and we expect this trend to continue some low cost carrier such southwest have not historically distributed their ticket through or other third party intermediary in addition certain airline have significantly limited or eliminated sale of airline ticket through opaque channel preferring to consistently show the lowest available price on their own website since the start of the worldwide recession domestic airline capacity ha been significantly reduced which reduces the number of airline ticket available to our customer and the amount of discounted airline ticket available for our name your own price business during airline significantly increased their average fare compared to which adversely impact travel demand reduced airline capacity and lower travel demand negatively impact our priceline com air business which in turn ha negative repercussion on our priceline com hotel and rental car business and could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition conversely decreased airfare can adversely impact our name your own price airline ticket sale by reducing the amount of absolute dollar saving compared to retail airline ticket we could be adversely affected by change in the airline industry and in many case we will have no control over such change or their timing recently there ha been significant domestic airline industry consolidation evidenced by merger of united air line with continental airline and delta air line with northwest airline well the recently announced future acquisition of airtran by southwest airline if one of our major airline supplier merges or consolidates with or is acquired by another company that either doe not participate in the priceline com system or that participates on substantially lower level the surviving company may elect not to participate in our table of content system or to participate at lower level than the previous supplier for example in september southwest airline announced that it entered into an agreement to acquire airtran airtran ha participated in our name your own price system on only limited basis but southwest airline ha never participated in fact southwest airline doe not currently distribute airline ticket through any online travel agent or permit it fare to appear in comparative fare display if airtran fare are taken out of the online marketplace result of this acquisition those fare would no longer be available to similarly united air line ha historically participated in our name your own price system at high level while continental airline ha historically participated at much lower level we can not predict the effect that the acquisition of airtran by southwest airline or the merger of united air line with continental airline will have on our business in addition in the event that one of our major supplier voluntarily or involuntarily declares bankruptcy and is subsequently unable to successfully emerge from bankruptcy and we are unable to replace such supplier our business would be adversely affected for example in april aloha airline and ata airline each ceased operation and we experienced an increase in credit card chargebacks from customer with ticket on those airline to the extent major airline that participate in our system declare bankruptcy or cease operation they may be unable or unwilling to honor ticket sold for their flight our policy in such event is to direct customer seeking refund or exchange to the airline and not to provide remedy because we are the merchant of record on sale of name your own price airline ticket to our customer however we could experience significant increase in demand for refund or credit card chargebacks from customer which could materially adversely affect our operation and financial result in addition because name your own price customer do not choose their airline hotel or rental car company the bankruptcy of major airline hotel or rental car company or even the possibility of such bankruptcy could discourage customer from using our name your own price system to book travel some travel supplier are encouraging third party travel intermediary such to develop technology to bypass the traditional gd such enabling direct connection to the travel supplier or using alternative global distribution method for example in december american airline terminated it participation in the orbitz service and withdrew it fare from the orbitz website this is consistent with an effort on the part of american airline and the airline industry in general to reduce distribution cost american airline termination of it distribution arrangement with orbitz could be indicative of the airline in general becoming more aggressive toward requiring online travel agent to implement direct connection in addition in december expedia preemptively removed american airline flight from it site it contract with american wa set to expire on december it is feasible that dispute between an airline and gd could lead to an airline removing it fare from the gd despite the fact that such dispute may not involve our business could be adversely affected if we are denied access to airfare in major gd during we implemented direct connection with american airline development and implementation of the technology to enable additional direct connection to travel supplier could cause to incur additional operating expense increase the frequency duration of system problem and delay other project in addition any additional migration toward direct connection would reduce the compensation we receive from gd the loss of any major airline participant in our name your own price system could result in other major airline electing to terminate their participation in the name your own price system which would further negatively impact our business result of operation and financial condition in addition fewer independent supplier reduces opacity and competition among supplier in such event if we are unable to divert sale to other supplier our business result of operation and financial condition may be adversely affected in addition given the concentration of the airline industry particularly in the domestic market our competitor could exert pressure on other airline not to supply with ticket moreover the airline may attempt to establish their own buyer driven commerce service or participate or invest in other similar service united airline prohibits certain travel agent from using united merchant processing system for retail credit card transaction when accepting credit card for payment such agent must use their own merchant account and settle with united with cash by requiring such agent to act merchant of record united pass the credit card processing cost onto the travel agent united ha not informed table of content that we must cease using united merchant processing system for credit card transaction however if united or another airline change it policy with respect to and requires to act merchant of record for retail airline ticket transaction we will incur additional credit card processing cost and increased chargeback activity and expense including chargeback expense in connection with the bankruptcy of any such airline avis is currently in discussion to acquire the dollar thrifty automotive group the merger or acquisition of the dollar thrifty automotive group by avis or another rental car company could result in decrease of rental car reservation available to our rental car service if another major rental car supplier merges or consolidates with or is acquired by another company that either doe not participate in the priceline com system or that participates on substantially lower level the surviving company may elect not to participate in our system or to participate at lower level than the previous supplier the loss of any rental car supplier participant in our name your own price system could result in other rental car supplier electing to terminate or reduce their participation in the name your own price system which would negatively impact our business result of operation and financial condition similarly industry consolidation and any resulting reduction in rental car capacity would limit the amount of availability for traveljigsaw rental car service furthermore many major rental car company are highly leveraged and the worldwide recession creates the potential for severe financial difficulty including without limitation the inability of rental car company to refinance it debt restructure it operation or emerge from bankruptcy any of which could lead to reduction in rental car supply made available to in addition fewer independent supplier reduces opacity and competition among supplier in such event if we are unable to divert sale to other supplier our business result of operation and financial condition may be adversely affected in addition any disruption in the supply of vehicle or the ability to dispose of vehicle by rental car company could impact the ability of the rental car company to match their fleet supply with demand which could adversely impact our business if the rental car industry is faced with excess supply rental car company may lower retail rental car rate which could be beneficial to our retail rental car business but detrimental to our name your own price business retail rental car rate decreased during the year ended december compared to the same period in despite toyota january recall of over million vehicle due to faulty accelerator pedal which led to strain on rental car company fleet and temporarily increased retail rental car rate because rental car day are typically le expensive than airline ticket or hotel room night reservation reduction in retail rental car rate ha disproportionately adverse effect on sale of name your own price rental car day since customer may be le likely to accept the trade offs associated with that service if the industry is faced with shortage of vehicle rental car company may further reduce the number of car reservation they distribute through our service or increase the negotiated rate at which they are willing to provide car reservation for example since the recent worldwide recession the rental car industry ha generally reduced it fleet capacity which ha limited the amount of discounted rental car day available for our name your own price rental car service we are exposed to fluctuation in currency exchange rate result of the growth of booking com and agoda and the acquisition of traveljigsaw we are conducting significant portion of our business outside the united state and are reporting our result in dollar result we face exposure to adverse movement in currency exchange rate the financial result of our international operation are translated from local currency principally the euro and the british pound sterling into dollar upon consolidation our international operation contributed approximately billion to our revenue for the year ended december respectively which compare to million for the year ended december year over year growth of approximately revenue attributable to our international operation increased on local currency basis by approximately in the year ended december compared to the same period in booking com agoda and traveljigsaw also face foreign exchange risk their foreign denominated revenue expense receivables and payable are translated into their respective functional table of content currency for example in the fourth quarter of the dollar wa stronger against the euro and the british pound sterling relative to the fourth quarter of which negatively impacted the growth rate of our euro and british pound sterling denominated gross booking gross profit and net income expressed in dollar in early greece and certain other european union country with high level of sovereign debt had difficulty refinancing that debt and central bank intervention wa required causing significant devaluation of the euro relative to other currency such the dollar and concern that sovereign default could lead to devaluation or abandonment of the common currency sovereign debt issue could lead to further significant and potentially longer term devaluation of the euro against the dollar which would adversely impact our euro denominated net asset gross booking revenue operating expense and net income expressed in dollar in addition many government around the world including the government are operating at large financial deficit disruption in the economy of such government could cause contribute to or be indicative of deteriorating macro economic condition furthermore governmental austerity measure aimed at reducing deficit could impair the economic recovery and adversely affect travel demand intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance we compete with both online and traditional seller of the service we offer the market for the service we offer is intensely competitive and current and new competitor can launch new site at relatively low cost we may not be able to effectively compete with industry conglomerate such expedia orbitz worldwide or sabre each of which may have access to significantly greater and more diversified resource than we do we currently or potentially compete with variety of company with respect to each service we offer with respect to our travel service these competitor include but are not limited to internet travel service such expedia hotel com hotwire and venere which are owned by expedia travelocity lastminute com and zuji which are owned by the sabre group orbitz com cheaptickets ebookers hotelclub and ratestogo which are currently owned by orbitz worldwide laterooms and asiarooms owned by tui travel and gulliver octopustravel superbreak hotel de hotel reservation service autoeurope holiday auto car trawler ctrip rakuten and wotif travel supplier such airline hotel company and rental car company many of which have their own branded website to which they drive business large online portal social networking group buying and search company such google yahoo including yahoo travel bing including bing travel facebook and groupon traditional travel agency wholesaler and tour operator online travel search site such kayak com mobissimo com farechase com hotelscombined and sidestep com each sometimes referred to meta search site and travel research site that have search functionality such tripadvisor travelzoo and cheapflights com and operator of travel industry reservation database such galileo travelport amadeus and sabre competition in domestic online travel remains intense and traditional online travel company are creating new promotion and consumer value feature in an effort to gain competitive advantage for example in travelocity launched an opaque price disclosed hotel booking service that allows customer to book room at discount because similar to our name your own price hotel booking service the name of the hotel is not disclosed until after purchase in addition in the fourth quarter of expedia began making opaque hotel room reservation available on it principal website under the name expedia unpublished rate if expedia or travelocity are successful in growing their opaque table of content hotel service our share of the discount hotel market in the could decrease online travel company have also offered consumer value feature such without limitation the elimination and or reduction of processing fee the adoption of best price guarantee and the waiver of cancellation and change fee the elimination of processing fee on retail airline ticket by and our major competitor coupled with the recent significant year over year increase in retail air fare ha led consumer to engage in increased shopping behavior before making purchase increased shopping behavior reduces our advertising efficiency and effectiveness traffic obtained through online advertising becomes le likely to result in purchase on our web site large established internet search engine with substantial resource and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating internet traffic are creating and intend to further create inroad into online travel both in the and internationally for example google recently announced that it ha entered into an agreement to acquire ita software inc major flight information software company which could allow google to pursue the creation of new flight search tool which will enable user to find flight information on the internet without using service like ours google ha also invested in homeaway vacation home rental service in addition google ha launched travel meta search site to show searcher specific hotel and rate in addition to text advertisement and microsoft ha launched bing travel meta search site which search for airfare and hotel reservation online and predicts the best time to purchase them meta search site leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search result for the searcher specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other website and in many instance compete directly with for customer these initiative among others illustrate google and bing clear intention to more directly appeal to travel consumer by showing consumer more detailed travel search result including specific information for traveler own itinerary which could lead to supplier or others gaining larger share of google or bing traffic or may ultimately lead to search engine maintaining transaction within their own website if google the single largest search engine in the world or bing or other leading search engine refer significant traffic to these or other travel service that they develop in the future it could result in among other thing more competition from supplier website and higher customer acquisition cost for third party site such ours and could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition many airline hotel and rental car supplier including supplier with which we conduct business are focusing on driving online demand to their own website in lieu of third party distributor such certain supplier have attempted to charge additional fee to customer who book airline reservation through an online channel other than their own website furthermore some airline may distribute their ticket exclusively through their own website supplier who sell on their own website typically do not charge processing fee and in some instance offer advantage such web only fare bonus mile or loyalty point which could make their offering more attractive to consumer than model like ours many of our current and potential competitor including internet directory search engine and large traditional retailer have longer operating history larger customer base greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial marketing personnel technical and other resource than we do some of these competitor may be able to secure service on more favorable term than we can in addition many of these competitor may be able to devote significantly greater resource to marketing and promotional campaign attracting traffic to their website attracting and retaining key employee securing vendor and supply and website and system development table of content increased competition could result in reduced operating margin loss of market share and damage to our brand there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitor or that competition will not have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition adverse application of state and local tax law could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation number of jurisdiction have initiated lawsuit against on line travel company including related to among other thing the payment of hotel occupancy and other tax state and local sale tax in addition number of municipality have initiated audit proceeding issued proposed tax assessment or started inquiry relating to the payment of hotel occupancy and other tax please see item legal proceeding and note to the consolidated financial statement for description of these pending case and proceeding additional state and local jurisdiction are likely to assert that we are subject to among other thing hotel occupancy and other tax state and local sale tax and could seek to collect such tax either retroactively or prospectively or both in connection with some hotel occupancy tax audit and assessment we may be required to pay any assessed tax which amount may be substantial prior to being allowed to contest the assessment and the applicability of the ordinance in judicial proceeding this requirement is commonly referred to pay to play or pay first payment of these amount if any is not an admission that we believe that we are subject to such tax and even if such payment are made we intend to continue to assert our position vigorously litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse development in these pending or future case and proceeding for example in october jury in san antonio class action found that we and the other online travel company that are defendant in the lawsuit control hotel for purpose of the local hotel occupancy tax ordinance at issue and are therefore subject to the requirement of those ordinance an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation may encourage the commencement of additional litigation audit proceeding or other regulatory inquiry in addition an unfavorable outcome or settlement of these action or proceeding could result in substantial liability for past and or future booking including among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost there have been and will continue to be substantial ongoing cost which may include pay to play payment associated with defending our position in pending and any future case or proceeding an adverse outcome in one or more of these unresolved proceeding could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation and could be material to our earnings or cash flow in any given operating period to the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that we have tax collection responsibility or we determine that we have one with respect to future transaction we may collect any such additional tax obligation from our customer which would have the effect of increasing the cost of hotel room reservation to our customer and consequently could make our hotel service le competitive versus the website of other online travel company or hotel company website and reduce hotel reservation transaction alternatively we could choose to reduce the compensation for our service on merchant hotel transaction either step could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation in many of the judicial and other proceeding initiated to date municipality seek not only historical tax that are claimed to be owed on our gross profit but also among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost the october jury verdict in the san antonio litigation and the related proceeding to determine among other thing the amount of penalty interest and attorney fee that could be owed by illustrate that any liability associated with hotel occupancy tax matter is not constrained by our liability for tax owed on our historical gross profit table of content we will continue to ass the risk of the potential financial impact of additional tax exposure and to the extent appropriate we will reserve for those estimate of liability fluctuation in our financial result make quarterly comparison and financial forecasting difficult our revenue and operating result have varied significantly from quarter to quarter because our business experience seasonal fluctuation which reflect seasonal trend for the travel service offered by our website traditional leisure travel booking in the united state are higher in the second and third calendar quarter of the year consumer take spring and summer vacation in the first and fourth quarter of the calendar year demand for travel service in europe and the united state generally decline from seasonal perspective furthermore prior to introducing retail travel option to our customer substantially all of our business wa conducted under the name your own price system and accordingly because those service are non refundable in nature we recognize travel revenue at the time booking wa generated we recognize revenue generated from our retail hotel service however including booking com and agoda at the time that the customer check out of the hotel result we have seen and expect to continue to see that meaningful amount of retail hotel booking generated earlier in the year customer plan and reserve their spring and summer vacation will not be recognized until future quarter this could result in disproportionate amount of our annual earnings being recognized in later quarter our result may also be affected by seasonal fluctuation in the supply made available to by airline hotel and rental car supplier our revenue and operating result may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter because of these factor result quarter to quarter comparison of our revenue and operating result may not be meaningful for example over the last several year we have experienced strong growth in the number of hotel room night booked through our hotel reservation service however given the sheer size of our hotel reservation business we believe it is highly likely that our year over year room night reservation growth rate will generally decelerate on quarterly sequential basis in future period for example in the first quarter of we experienced mild deceleration in year over year hotel room night reservation growth compared to the year over year growth rate in the fourth quarter of the unit growth rate decelerated further in the second quarter of due in part to travel disruption caused by the april eruption of volcano in iceland general uncertainty about the european economy and substantial increase in airfare which can negatively impact overall travel demand the volcanic activity subsided macroeconomic concern in europe abated and airfare increase moderated our third quarter year over year hotel room night reservation growth rate accelerated and then reverted to the pattern of deceleration in the fourth quarter because of these fluctuation and uncertainty our operating result may fail to meet the expectation of security analyst and investor if this happens the trading price of our common stock would be adversely affected there can be no assurance that we can maintain our innovation box tax benefit effective january the netherlands modified it corporate income tax law related to income generated from qualifying innovative activity the innovation box tax earnings that qualify for the innovation box tax will effectively be taxed at the rate of rather than the dutch statutory rate of of booking com obtained ruling from the dutch tax authority in february confirming that portion of it earnings qualifying earnings is eligible for innovation box tax treatment the ruling from the dutch tax authority is valid from january through december the initial period in order to be eligible for innovation box tax treatment booking com must among other thing apply for and obtain research and development certificate from dutch governmental agency every six month confirming that the activity that booking com intends to be engaged in over the subsequent six month period are innovative should booking com fail to secure such certificate in any such period for example because the governmental agency doe not view booking com new or anticipated activity innovative or should this agency determine that the activity contemplated to be performed in prior period were not performed contemplated or not comply with the agency requirement booking com may lose it certificate and result the innovation box tax benefit may be reduced or eliminated after the initial period booking com intends to reapply for continued innovation box tax treatment for future period there can be no assurance that booking com application will be accepted or that the amount of qualifying earnings or applicable tax rate will not be reduced at that time in addition there can be no assurance that the tax law will not change in and or future year resulting in reduction or elimination of the tax benefit the loss of the innovation box tax benefit in future period could adversely impact our result of operation our stock price is highly volatile the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuation in response to factor such the following some of which are beyond our control operating result that vary from the expectation of security analyst and investor quarterly variation in our operating result change in expectation to our future financial performance including financial estimate by security analyst and investor announcement of technological innovation or new service by or our competitor table of content change in our capital structure change in market valuation of other internet or online service company announcement by or our competitor of price reduction promotion significant contract acquisition strategic partnership joint venture or capital commitment loss of major supplier participant such an airline or hotel chain change in the status of our intellectual property right lack of success in the expansion of our business model geographically announcement by third party of significant claim or proceeding against or adverse development in pending proceeding occurrence of significant security breach addition or departure of key personnel and stock market price and volume fluctuation sale of substantial number of share of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock by introducing large number of seller to the market given the volatility that exists for our share such sale could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly in addition fluctuation in our stock price and our price to earnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum hedge or day trading investor who often shift fund into and out of stock rapidly exacerbating price fluctuation in either direction particularly when viewed on quarterly basis the trading price of internet company stock in general including ours have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuation to the extent that the public perception of the prospect of internet or commerce company is negative our stock price could decline further regardless of our result other broad market and industry factor may decrease the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance market fluctuation well general political and economic condition such recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuation also may decrease the market price of our common stock negative market condition could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital we are defendant in security class action litigation in the past security class action litigation often ha been brought against company following period of volatility in the market price of it security to the extent our stock price decline or is volatile we may in the future be the target of additional litigation this additional litigation could result in substantial cost and divert management attention and resource our business could be negatively affected by change in search engine algorithm and dynamic or termination of traffic generating arrangement we utilize internet search engine and other travel demand aggregation website principally through the purchase of travel related keywords to generate traffic to our website booking com and agoda in particular rely to significant extent upon google to generate business and to much lesser extent other search engine and other travel demand aggregation website search engine such google frequently update and change the logic which determines the placement and display of result of user search such that the placement of link to our site and particularly those of booking com agoda and their affiliate can be negatively affected in similar way significant amount of booking com and agoda business is directed to our own website through participation in pay per click advertising campaign on internet search engine whose pricing and operating dynamic can experience rapid change commercially technically and competitively in addition we purchase web traffic from number of source including some operated by our competitor in the form of pay per click arrangement that can be terminated with little or no notice if one or more of such arrangement is terminated or if major table of content search engine such google change it algorithm in manner that negatively affect the search engine ranking of our brand or our third party distribution partner or change it pricing operating or competitive dynamic in negative manner our business result of operation and financial condition would be adversely affected in addition booking com and agoda rely on various third party distribution channel affiliate to distribute hotel room reservation should one or more of such third party cease distribution of booking com and agoda reservation or suffer deterioration in it search engine ranking due to change in search engine algorithm or otherwise the business of booking com and agoda could be negatively affected our processing storage use and disclosure of personal data expose to risk of internal or external security breach and could give rise to liability result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirement or differing view of personal privacy right the security of data when engaging in electronic commerce is essential in maintaining consumer and supplier confidence in our service substantial or ongoing security breach whether instigated internally or externally on our system or other internet based system could significantly harm our business we currently require customer who use certain of our service to guarantee their offer with their credit card either online or in some instance through our toll free telephone service it is possible that advance in computer circumvention capability new discovery or other development including our own act or omission could result in compromise or breach of customer transaction data we can not guarantee that our existing security measure will prevent security breach or attack party whether internal external an affiliate or unrelated third party that is able to circumvent our security system could steal customer information or transaction data proprietary information or cause significant interruption in our operation for instance from time to time we have experienced denial of service type attack on our system that have made portion of our website slow or unavailable for period of time we may need to expend significant resource to protect against security breach or to address problem caused by breach and reduction in website availability and response time could cause loss of substantial business volume during the occurrence of any such incident these issue are likely to become more difficult we expand the number of place where we operate and the tool and technique used in such attack become more advanced security breach could result in negative publicity damage our reputation expose to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject to regulatory penalty and sanction security breach could also cause customer and potential customer to lose confidence in our security which would have negative effect on the value of our brand our insurance policy carry low coverage limit and would likely not be adequate to reimburse for loss caused by security breach company that we have acquired such booking com agoda and traveljigsaw and that we may acquire in the future may employ security and networking standard at level we find unsatisfactory the process of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved security and network standard may be time consuming and expensive and may require resource and expertise that are difficult to obtain such acquisition increase the number of potential vulnerability and can cause delay in detection of an attack well the timeline of recovery from any given attack failure to raise any such standard that we find unsatisfactory could expose to security breach of among other thing personal customer data and credit card information that would have an adverse impact on our business result of operation and financial condition we also face risk associated with security breach affecting third party conducting business over the internet consumer generally are concerned with security and privacy on the internet and any publicized security problem could inhibit the growth of the internet and therefore our service mean of conducting commercial transaction additionally security breach at third party such supplier or distributor system upon which we rely could result in negative publicity damage our table of content reputation expose to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject to regulatory penalty and sanction some of our business is conducted with third party marketing affiliate which may generate travel reservation through our infrastructure or through other system security breach at such third party could be perceived by consumer security breach of our system and could result in negative publicity damage our reputation expose to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject to regulatory penalty and sanction in addition such third party may not comply with applicable disclosure requirement which could expose to liability in our processing of travel transaction we receive and store large volume of personally identifiable data this data is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation in numerous jurisdiction around the world including the commission of the european union through it data protection directive and variation of that directive in the member state of the european union this government action is typically intended to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulation are expanded to require change in our business practice or if governing jurisdiction interpret or implement their legislation or regulation in way that negatively affect our business result of operation and financial condition in addition in the aftermath of the terrorist attack of september in the united state government agency have been contemplating or developing

to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed our performance is largely dependent on the talent and effort of highly skilled individual our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all area of our organization in particular the contribution of certain key senior management in the europe and asia are critical to the overall management of the company in addition because our european senior management noncontrolling ownership interest wa repurchased in september it may become more difficult to retain these senior manager we can not ensure that we will be able to retain the service of any member of our senior management or other key employee the loss of whom could harm our business in addition competition for well qualified employee in all aspect of our business including software engineer and other technology professional is intense both in the and abroad with the recent success of our international business and the increased profile of the booking com business and brand competitor have increased their effort to hire our

comprised of hire by or for our international operation such expansion increase the complexity of our business and place significant strain on our management operation technical performance financial resource and internal financial control and reporting function there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our expansion effectively our current and planned personnel system procedure and

manage required personnel which may limit our growth damage our reputation negatively affect our financial performance and harm our business capacity constraint and system failure could harm our business we rely on certain third party computer system and third party service provider including the computerized central reservation system of the airline hotel and rental car industry to satisfy

rental car reservation and have material adverse effect on our business our agreement with some third party service provider are terminable upon short notice and often do not provide recourse for service interruption in the event our arrangement with any of such third party is terminated we may not be able to find an alternative source of system support on timely basis or on commercially reasonable term and result it could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition we depend upon chase paymentech to process our credit card transaction global collect and others to process agoda credit card transaction and wright express to provide credit card number which we use payment mechanism for merchant hotel transaction if any of these provider were wholly or partially compromised our cash flow could be disrupted until such time replacement process could be put in place with different vendor we add complexity to our system infrastructure by adding new supplier and distribution our total system availability could decline and our result could suffer substantial amount of our computer hardware for operating our service is

and operation are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error flood fire power loss telecommunication failure and similar event they are also subject to break in sabotage intentional act of vandalism and similar misconduct despite any precaution we may take the occurrence of any disruption of service due to any such misconduct natural disaster or other unanticipated problem at the savvis facility the at facility the equinix europe ltd facility and the global switch amsterdam facility or other facility could result in lengthy interruption in our service in addition the failure by savvis verizon at equinix europe ltd colt telecom group limited verizon business trueserver or other communication provider to provide our required data communication capacity could result in interruption in our service any system failure that cause an interruption in service or decrease the responsiveness of our service could impair our reputation damage our brand name and have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition table of content we do not have completely formalized disaster recovery plan in every geographic region in which we conduct business in the event of certain system failure we may not be able to switch to back up system immediately and the time to full recovery could be prolonged like many online business we have experienced system failure from time to time in addition to placing increased burden on our engineering staff these outage create significant amount of user question and complaint that need to be addressed by our customer support personnel any unscheduled interruption in our service could result in an immediate loss of revenue that can be substantial increase customer service cost and cause some user to switch to our competitor if we experience frequent or persistent system failure our reputation and brand could be permanently harmed we have been taking step to increase the reliability and redundancy of our system these step are expensive may reduce our margin and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime we use both internally developed system and third party system to operate our service including transaction processing order management and financial system if the number of user of our service increase substantially or if critical third party system stop operating designed we will need to significantly expand and upgrade our technology transaction processing system financial and accounting system and other infrastructure we do not know whether we will be able to upgrade our system and infrastructure to accommodate such condition in timely manner and depending on the third party system affected our transactional financial and accounting system could be impacted for meaningful amount of time before repair if our system can not be expanded to cope with increased demand or fails to perform we could experience unanticipated disruption in service slower response time decreased customer service and customer satisfaction or delay in the introduction of new service any of which could impair our reputation damage our brand and materially and adversely affect our revenue while we do maintain redundant system and hosting service for some of our business it is possible that we could experience an interruption in our business and we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate for loss that may occur company that we have acquired such booking com agoda and traveljigsaw and that we may acquire in the future may present known or unknown capacity stability or other type of system challenge the process of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved capacity scalability and other system characteristic may be time consuming and expensive and may require resource and expertise that are difficult to obtain such acquisition increase potential downtime customer facing problem and compliance problem failure to successfully make any such improvement to such infrastructure could expose to potential capacity stability and system problem that would have an adverse impact on our business result of operation and financial condition our financial result will likely be materially impacted by payment of cash income tax in the future until our domestic net operating loss carryforwards are utilized or expire we do not expect to make payment on our income for the foreseeable future except for federal alternative minimum tax and state income tax however we expect to pay foreign tax on our foreign income we expect that our international operation will grow their pretax income at higher rate than the over the long term and therefore it is our expectation that our cash tax payment will increase our international operation generate an increasing share of our pretax income we may have exposure to additional tax liability an international corporation with office in over country around the world we are subject to income tax well non income based tax in both the united state and various foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax and other tax liability change in tax law or tax ruling may have significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate for example proposal for fundamental international tax reform such certain proposal by president obama administration if enacted could have significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate although we believe that our tax estimate are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audit or tax dispute will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accrual we are also subject to non income based tax such payroll sale use value added net worth property and good and service tax in both the united state and various foreign jurisdiction from time to time we are under audit by tax authority with respect to these non income based tax and may have exposure to additional non income based tax liability table of content acquisition could result in operating difficulty part of our business strategy we acquired booking com limited in september booking com in july agoda in november and traveljigsaw in may we may enter into additional business combination and acquisition in the future acquisition may result in dilutive issuance of equity security use of our cash resource incurrence of debt and amortization of expense related to intangible asset acquired in addition the process of integrating an acquired company business or technology may create unforeseen operating difficulty and expenditure the acquisition of booking com booking com limited agoda and traveljigsaw were accompanied by number of risk including without limitation the need to implement or remediate control procedure and policy appropriate for larger public company at company that prior to the acquisition may have lacked such control procedure and policy the difficulty of assimilating the operation and personnel of booking com limited which are principally located in cambridge england booking com which are principally located in amsterdam the netherlands agoda which are principally located in singapore and bangkok thailand and traveljigsaw which are principally located in manchester england with and into our operation which are headquartered in norwalk connecticut the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and right into our service and unanticipated expense related to such integration the failure to further successfully develop acquired technology resulting in the impairment of amount currently capitalized intangible asset the impairment of relationship with customer of booking com booking com limited agoda and traveljigsaw or our own customer result of any integration of operation the impairment of relationship with employee of booking com booking com limited agoda and traveljigsaw or our own business result of any integration of new management personnel the potential unknown liability associated with booking com booking com limited agoda and traveljigsaw we may experience similar risk in connection with any future acquisition we may not be successful in addressing these risk or any other problem encountered in connection with the acquisition of booking com booking com limited agoda or traveljigsaw or that we could encounter in future acquisition which would harm our business or cause to fail to realize the anticipated benefit of our acquisition of december we had approximately million assigned to the intangible asset and goodwill of booking com booking com limited agoda and traveljigsaw and therefore the occurrence of any of the risk identified above could result in material adverse impact including an impairment of these asset which could cause to have to record charge for impairment any such charge could adversely impact our operating result which would likely cause our stock price to decline significantly we may not be able to keep up with rapid technological and other change the market in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standard consolidation frequent new service announcement introduction and enhancement and changing consumer demand we may not be able to keep up with these rapid change in addition these market characteristic are heightened by the emerging nature of the internet and the apparent need of company from many industry to offer internet based service result our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technology to adapt our service to evolving industry table of content standard and to continually improve the performance feature and reliability of our service in response to competitive service offering and the evolving demand of the marketplace in addition the widespread adoption of new internet networking or telecommunication technology or other technological change could require to incur substantial expenditure to modify or adapt our service or infrastructure we rely on the value of the booking com priceline com and agoda com brand along with others and the cost of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing we believe that maintaining and expanding the booking com priceline com and agoda brand and other owned brand including lowestfare com rentalcars com breezenet com mytravelguide com travelweb hotelroom com traveljigsaw and car hire are important aspect of our effort to attract and expand our user and advertiser base our larger competitor spend increasingly more on advertising we are required to spend more in order to maintain our brand recognition in addition we have spent considerable money and resource to date on the establishment and maintenance of the booking com priceline com and agoda brand and we will continue to spend money on and devote resource to advertising marketing and other brand building effort to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brand we may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness of these brand and even if we are successful in our branding effort such effort may not be cost effective if we are unable to maintain or enhance customer awareness of our brand in cost effective manner our business result of operation and financial condition would be adversely affected we are exposed to various counterparty risk we are party to derivative instrument to hedge our exposure to potential dilution upon conversion of certain of our convertible senior note the counterparties to our conversion spread hedge are goldman sachs and merrill lynch under the conversion spread hedge we are entitled to purchase from the counterparties approximately million share of our common stock the number of share underlying the note at strike price of per share subject to adjustment in certain circumstance and the counterparties are entitled to purchase from approximately million share of our common stock at strike price of per share subject to adjustment in certain circumstance the conversion spread hedge increase the effective conversion price of the note to per share from our perspective and are designed to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the note if the market value per share of our common stock at maturity is above the conversion spread hedge will entitle to receive from the counterparties net share of our common stock based on the excess of the then current market price of our common stock over the strike price of the hedge up to if any of the counterparties to these derivative instrument were to liquidate declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease operation it may not satisfy it obligation under these derivative instrument in such event our fully diluted share count would be increased which would negatively impact our fully diluted earnings per share we will be subject to increased income tax in the event that our foreign cash balance are remitted to the united state of december we held approximately million of cash and short term liquid investment outside of the united state to date we have used our foreign cash to reinvest in our foreign operation it is our current expectation to make further investment in our foreign operation with our foreign cash if our foreign cash balance continue to grow and our ability to reinvest those balance diminishes it will become increasingly likely that we will repatriate some of our foreign cash balance to the united state in such event we would likely be subject to additional income tax expense in the united state with respect to our unremitted foreign earnings we would not incur an increase in tax payment unless we repatriate the cash and no longer have net operating loss carryforwards available to offset the taxable income additionally if we were to repatriate foreign cash to the it would use portion of our domestic net operating loss carryforward which could result in being subject to cash income tax on the earnings of our domestic business sooner than would otherwise have been the case table of content in addition on february president barack obama proposed significant change to the international tax law that would limit deduction for interest expense related to un repatriated foreign source income and modify the foreign tax credit rule we can not determine whether all of these proposal will be enacted into law or what if any change may be made to such proposal prior to their being enacted into law if the tax law change in manner that increase our tax obligation our result could suffer regulatory and legal uncertainty could harm our business the service we offer are regulated by regulation including without limitation law ordinance rule and other regulation of national and local government and regulatory authority around the world our ability to provide our service is and will continue to be affected by such regulation the implementation of unfavorable regulation or unfavorable interpretation of existing regulation by judicial or regulatory body could require to incur significant compliance cost cause the development of the affected market to become impractical and otherwise have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition compliance with international and law and regulation that apply to our international operation increase our cost of business in foreign jurisdiction these law and regulation include law such the foreign corrupt practice act and local law which also prohibit corrupt payment to governmental official data privacy requirement labor relation law tax law anti competition regulation and consumer protection law violation of these law and regulation could result in fine criminal sanction against our officer or our employee and prohibition on the conduct of our business any such violation could result in prohibition on our ability to offer our service in one or more country could delay or prevent potential acquisition and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion effort our ability to attract and retain employee our business and our operating result our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risk and manage these difficulty we are also subject to variety of other risk and challenge in managing an organization operating in various country including those related to general economic condition in each country or region fluctuation in currency exchange rate and related impact to our operating result regulatory change political unrest terrorism and the potential for other hostility public health risk particularly in area in which we have significant operation longer payment cycle and difficulty in collecting account receivable additional complexity to comply with regulation in multiple tax jurisdiction well overlapping tax regime our ability to repatriate fund held by our foreign subsidiary to the united state at favorable tax rate difficulty in transferring fund from or converting currency in certain country and reduced protection for intellectual property right in some country our business ha grown substantially over the last several year and continues to expand into new geographical location in addition we have made effort and expect to make further effort to integrate supply across our various demand platform these change add to complexity in tax compliance and our increased size and operating history may increase the likelihood that we will be subject to audit by taxing authority in various jurisdiction to date we have been audited in several taxing jurisdiction with no significant adjustment result if future audit found that additional tax were due we may be subject to tax liability possibly including interest and penalty which could have material adverse impact on our financial condition and result of operation in addition the strategy of booking com agoda and traveljigsaw involves rapid expansion into region around the world including europe asia north america south america and elsewhere many of which have different legislation regulatory environment tax law and level of political stability in september the united kingdom office of fair trading oft the competition authority in the announced it wa conducting formal early stage investigation into suspected breach of competition law in the hotel online booking sector and had written to number of party in the industry to request information specifically the investigation focus upon whether there are agreement or concerted practice between hotel and online travel company and or hotel room reservation wholesaler relating to the fixed or minimum resale price of hotel room reservation in september booking com and priceline com incorporated on behalf of booking com received notice of inquiry from the oft we and booking com are cooperating with the oft investigation we are unable at this time to predict the outcome of the oft investigation and the impact if any on our business and result of operation compliance with foreign legal regulatory or tax requirement will place demand on our time and resource and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse legal regulatory or tax consequence we face risk related to our intellectual property we regard our intellectual property critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreement with our employee customer partner and others to protect our proprietary right if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property it could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition while we believe that our issued patent and pending patent application help to protect our business there can be no assurance that third party will not have or obtain one or more patent that can prevent from practicing feature of our business or that will require to pay for license to use those feature our operation do not or will not infringe valid enforceable patent of third party any patent can be successfully defended against challenge by third party the pending patent application will result in the issuance of patent competitor or potential competitor will not devise new method of competing with that are not covered by our patent or patent application table of content because of variation in the application of our business model to each of our service our patent will be effective in preventing one or more third party from utilizing copycat business model to offer the same service in one or more category new prior art will not be discovered that may diminish the value of or invalidate an issued patent or legislative or judicial action will not directly or indirectly affect the scope and validity of any of our patent right there ha been recent discussion in the press regarding the examination and issuance of so called business method patent result the united state patent and trademark office ha indicated that it intends to intensify the review process applicable to such patent application the new procedure are not expected to have direct effect on patent already granted we can not anticipate what effect if any the new review process will have on our pending patent application in addition there ha been recent discussion in various federal court proceeding regarding the patentability and validity of so called business method patent the supreme court in recent decision in bilski kappos partially addressed the patentability of so called business method patent we can not anticipate what effect if any any new federal court decision or new legislation will have on our issued patent or pending patent application we pursue the registration of our trademark and service mark in the and internationally however effective trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our service are made available online we have licensed in the past and expect to license in the future certain of our proprietary right such trademark or copyrighted material to third party these licensee may take action that might diminish the value of our proprietary right or harm our reputation from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we have been subject to and are currently subject to legal proceeding and claim relating to the intellectual property right of others and we expect that third party will continue to assert intellectual property claim in particular patent claim against particularly we expand the complexity and scope of our business we endeavor to defend our intellectual property right diligently but intellectual property litigation is extremely expensive and time consuming and ha and is likely to continue to divert managerial attention and resource from our business objective successful infringement claim against could result in significant monetary liability or prevent from operating our business or portion of our business in addition resolution of claim may require to obtain license to use intellectual property right belonging to third party which may be expensive to procure or possibly to cease using those right altogether any of these event could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation or financial condition our business is exposed to risk associated with credit card fraud and chargebacks our result have been negatively impacted by purchase made using fraudulent credit card because we act the merchant of record in majority of our priceline com transaction well those of agoda and traveljigsaw we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit card on our website well other payment dispute with our customer additionally we are held liable for accepting fraudulent credit card in certain retail transaction when we do not act merchant of record accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card chargebacks if we are unable to combat the use of fraudulent credit card on our website our business result of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected table of content in addition in the event that one of our major supplier voluntarily or involuntarily declares bankruptcy we could experience an increase in credit card chargebacks from customer with travel reservation with such supplier for example airline that participate in our system and declare bankruptcy or cease operation may be unable or unwilling to honor ticket sold for their flight our policy in such event is to direct customer seeking refund or exchange to the airline and not to provide remedy ourselves because we are the merchant of record on sale of name your own price airline ticket to our customer however we could experience significant increase in demand for refund or credit card chargebacks from customer which could materially adversely affect our operation and financial result for example in april aloha airline and ata airline each ceased operation and we experienced an increase in credit card chargebacks from customer with ticket on those airline the unit profitability of certain of our business ha declined and could continue to decline we may be subject to among other thing competitive pressure and loss or reduction of global distribution system fee in recent year the amount of profit we make per airline ticket sold ha declined and could continue to decline we among other thing experience pressure from supplier to reduce our profit strive to remain competitive with other online travel agency and continue to be subject to reduction of global distribution system or gd fee paid to historically we have relied on fee paid to by gd for travel booking made through gd for portion of our gross profit and substantial portion of our operating income we rebate certain gd cost to certain supplier airline hotel etc in exchange for contractual consideration such those relating to pricing and availability and expect to continue to do so in the future supplier put pressure on to reduce our aggregate compensation and book through lower cost channel to receive full content and avoid penalty we have agreement with number of supplier to obtain access to content and are in continuing discussion with others to obtain similar access if we were denied access to full content or had to impose service fee on our service it could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition additionally some travel supplier are encouraging third party travel intermediary such to develop technology to bypass the traditional gd such enabling direct connection to the travel supplier or using alternative global distribution method for example in december american airline terminated it participation in the orbitz service and withdrew it fare from the orbitz website this is consistent with an effort on the part of american airline and the airline industry in general to reduce distribution cost american airline termination of it distribution arrangement with orbitz could be indicative of the airline in general becoming more aggressive toward requiring online travel agent to implement direct connection in addition in december expedia preemptively removed american airline flight from it site it contract with american wa set to expire on december it is feasible that dispute between an airline and gd could lead to an airline removing it fare from the gd despite the fact that such dispute may not involve our business could be adversely affected if we are denied access to airfare in major gd during we implemented direct connection with american airline development and implementation of the technology to enable additional direct connection to travel supplier could cause to incur additional operating expense increase the frequency duration of system problem and delay other project in addition any additional migration toward direct connection would reduce the compensation we receive from gd we are party to legal proceeding which if adversely decided could materially adversely affect we are party to the legal proceeding described in item and note to the consolidated financial statement the defense of the action described in item and note may increase our expense and an adverse outcome in any of such action could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation table of content item unresolved staff comment none item property our executive administrative operating office and network operation center are located in approximately square foot of leased office space located in norwalk connecticut we also lease approximately square foot of office space in grand rapid michigan booking com limited lease approximately square foot of office space primarily in cambridge england booking com lease approximately square foot of office space in amsterdam netherlands and in other country in support of it international operation agoda lease approximately square foot of office space in bangkok thailand and in other country in support of it international operation traveljigsaw lease approximately square foot of office space in manchester england we do not own any real estate of february we believe that our existing facility are adequate to meet our current requirement and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available needed to accommodate any further expansion of corporate operation item legal proceeding litigation related to hotel occupancy and other tax we and certain third party defendant online travel company are currently involved in approximately fifty lawsuit including certified and putative class action brought by or against state city and county over issue involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other tax state and local sale tax and our merchant hotel business our subsidiary lowestfare com llc and travelweb llc are named in some but not all of these case generally each complaint alleges among other thing that the defendant violated each jurisdiction respective hotel occupancy tax ordinance with respect to the charge and remittance of amount to cover tax under each law each complaint typically seek compensatory damage disgorgement penalty available by law attorney fee and other relief we are also involved in one consumer lawsuit relating to among other thing the payment of hotel occupancy tax and service fee in addition approximately sixty municipality or county and at least six state have initiated audit proceeding including proceeding initiated by more than forty municipality in california issued proposed tax assessment or started inquiry relating to the payment of hotel occupancy and other tax state and local sale tax additional state and local jurisdiction are likely to assert that we are subject to among other thing hotel occupancy and other tax state and local sale tax and could seek to collect such tax retroactively and or prospectively with respect to the principal claim in these matter we believe that the ordinance at issue do not apply to the service we provide namely the facilitation of reservation and therefore that we do not owe the tax that are claimed to be owed rather we believe that the ordinance at issue generally impose hotel occupancy and other tax on entity that own operate or control hotel or similar business or furnish or provide hotel room or similar accommodation in addition in many of these matter municipality have asserted claim for conversion essentially that we have collected tax and wrongfully pocketed those tax dollar claim that we believe is without basis and have vigorously contested the municipality that are currently involved in litigation and other proceeding with and that may be involved in future proceeding have asserted contrary position and will likely continue to do so from time to time we have found it expedient to settle and may in the future agree to table of content settle claim pending in these matter without conceding that the claim at issue are meritorious or that the claimed tax are in fact due to be paid in connection with some of these tax audit and assessment we may be required to pay any assessed tax which amount may be substantial prior to being allowed to contest the assessment and the applicability of the ordinance in judicial proceeding this requirement is commonly referred to pay to play or pay first for example the city of san francisco assessed approximately million an amount that includes interest and penalty relating to hotel occupancy tax which we paid in july payment of these amount if any is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such tax and even if such payment are made we intend to continue to assert our position vigorously we have successfully argued against pay first requirement asserted in another california proceeding litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse development in these pending or future case and proceeding for example in october jury in san antonio class action found that we and the other online travel company that are defendant in the lawsuit control hotel for purpose of the local hotel occupancy tax ordinance at issue and are therefore subject to the requirement of those ordinance an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation may encourage the commencement of additional litigation audit proceeding or other regulatory inquiry in addition an unfavorable outcome or settlement of these action or proceeding could result in substantial liability for past and or future booking including among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost there have been and will continue to be substantial ongoing cost which may include pay first payment associated with defending our position in pending and any future case or proceeding an adverse outcome in one or more of these unresolved proceeding could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation and could be material to our earnings or cash flow in any given operating period to the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that we have tax collection responsibility or we determine that we have such responsibility with respect to future transaction we may collect any such additional tax obligation from our customer which would have the effect of increasing the cost of hotel room reservation to our customer and consequently could make our hotel service le competitive versus the website of other online travel company or hotel company website and reduce hotel reservation transaction alternatively we could choose to reduce the compensation for our service on merchant hotel transaction either step could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation we estimate that since our inception through december we have earned aggregate gross profit including fee from our entire merchant hotel business which includes among other thing the differential between the price paid by customer for our service and the cost of the underlying room of approximately billion this gross profit wa earned in over thousand taxing jurisdiction that we believe have aggregate tax rate which may include hotel occupancy tax state and local tax among other tax associated with typical transaction between consumer and hotel that generally range from approximately to approximately depending on the jurisdiction in many of the judicial and other proceeding initiated to date municipality seek not only historical tax that are claimed to be owed on our gross profit but also among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost any liability associated with hotel occupancy tax matter is not constrained to our liability for tax owed on our historical gross profit but may also include among other thing penalty interest and attorney fee to date the majority of the taxing jurisdiction in which we facilitate hotel reservation have not asserted that tax are due and payable on our merchant hotel business with respect to municipality that have not initiated proceeding to date it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statute and seek to collect tax from only on prospective basis table of content result of this litigation and other attempt by jurisdiction to levy similar tax we have established reserve for the potential resolution of issue related to hotel occupancy and other tax in the amount of approximately million of december compared to approximately million of december which includes among other thing amount related to the litigation in san antonio the reserve is based on our reasonable estimate and the ultimate resolution of these issue may be le or greater potentially significantly than the liability recorded development to date in the year ended december and to date nine of the approximately fifty currently pending lawsuit and thirteen of the total number of currently pending administrative proceeding noted above were commenced ruling granting dispositive motion brought by or another co defendant motion to dismiss or for summary judgment were issued in ten case for example in december in priceline com inc city of anaheim the court entered judgment setting aside an earlier hearing officer determination that we and other co defendant were liable for the transient occupancy tax at issue that case is on appeal ruling granting dispositive motion or granting relief sought by plaintiff municipality or state also were issued for example in may in an administrative proceeding city of san diego hotel com the hearing officer appointed by the city issued ruling holding and other online travel company liable for transient occupancy tax we have filed judicial action challenging that ruling in another example in january in travelscape llc south carolina department of revenue case in which we were not defendant the south carolina supreme court affirmed lower court decision holding that travelscape an online travel company wa subject to that state sale tax because travelscape wa engaged in the business of furnishing accommodation in light of this ruling we recorded million charge to general and administrative expense for the year ended december in july in city of atlanta hotel com the court issued ruling expressly holding that we and our co defendant were not hotel operator under the city of atlanta ordinance and were not liable for claimed historic tax amount at the same time however the city of atlanta court found that under the merchant model we and our co defendant have undertaken an obligation to collect tax and granted plaintiff request for an injunction prospectively enjoining defendant to collect and remit occupancy tax on their compensation for reservation facilitation service to the city of atlanta the city of atlanta decision is on appeal several jurisdiction including the state of new york and north carolina amended their respective law in an effort to tax online travel company and merchant model gross revenue we have complied with applicable amended law lastly we reached agreement with the respective plaintiff resolving the claim for purported back tax in county of monroe florida priceline com inc et al

have been dismissed we also reached an agreement with the plaintiff in county of brevard florida priceline com inc et al and that case wa dismissed on january part of each of the agreement plaintiff have agreed to not assert claim based on the ordinance at issue in the respective action for period of time ranging from two to four year the settlement amount in these case are not material to our result of operation for the year ended december table of content the currently pending occupancy tax matter are listed below we intend to defend vigorously against the claim in all of the proceeding

statement included elsewhere in this form and the section entitled special note regarding forward looking statement in this form discussed in more detail in the section entitled special note regarding forward looking statement this discussion contains forward looking statement which involve risk and uncertainty our actual result may differ materially from the result discussed in the forward looking statement factor that might cause those difference include but are not limited to those discussed in risk factor overview we are leading online travel company that offer our customer hotel room reservation at over hotel worldwide through the booking com priceline com and agoda brand we offer international car rental reservation service through traveljigsaw which we acquired in may in the united state we also offer our customer car rental reservation airline ticket vacation package cruise and destination service we launched our business in the united state in under the priceline com brand and have since expanded our operation to include among others the international brand booking com agoda and traveljigsaw our principal goal is to maintain and grow our position the leading worldwide online hotel reservation service measured by room night booked our business is driven primarily by international result during the year ended december our international business the significant majority of which is currently generated by booking com represented approximately of our gross booking an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value generally inclusive of all tax and fee of all travel service purchased by our customer and approximately of our consolidated operating income given that the business of our international operation is primarily comprised of hotel reservation service commission earned in connection with the reservation of hotel room night represents substantial majority of our gross profit because our domestic service include merchant name your own price travel service which are reported on gross basis while both our domestic and international retail travel service are primarily recorded on net basis revenue increase and decrease are impacted by change in the mix of the sale of name your own price and retail travel service and consequently gross profit ha become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business at present we derive substantially all of our gross profit from the following source commission earned from price disclosed hotel room reservation rental car cruise and other travel service transaction gross profit and customer processing fee from our name your own price hotel room reservation rental car and airline ticket service well our vacation package service and transaction gross profit and customer processing fee from our price disclosed merchant hotel room and rental car reservation service global distribution system gd reservation booking fee related to both our name your own price airline ticket hotel room reservation and rental car service and price disclosed airline ticket and rental car service and other gross profit derived primarily from selling advertising on our website table of content the recent worldwide recession negatively affected the broad travel market and result our business at the onset of the worldwide recession hotel operator reported significant decrease in occupancy rate common metric that measure hotel customer usage and average daily rate adrs in the united state europe and asia while these trend have recently shown sign of improvement there can be no assurance that worldwide economic condition will not worsen or have negative impact on the travel industry and result our business over the last several year we have experienced strong growth in the number of hotel room night reservation booked through our hotel reservation service however given the sheer size of our hotel reservation business we believe it is highly likely that our year over year room night reservation growth rate will generally decelerate on quarterly sequential basis for example in the first quarter of we experienced mild deceleration in year over year hotel room night reservation growth compared to the year over year growth rate in the fourth quarter of the unit growth rate decelerated further in the second quarter of due in part to travel disruption caused by the april eruption of volcano in iceland general uncertainty about the european economy and substantial increase in airfare which can negatively impact overall travel demand the volcanic activity subsided macroeconomic concern in europe abated and airfare increase moderated our third quarter year over year hotel room night reservation growth rate accelerated and then reverted to the pattern of deceleration in the fourth quarter additionally an increasing amount of our business from destination and point of sale perspective is conducted in market that we have entered more recently and are growing faster than our overall growth rate such asia pacific and south america ongoing effort to improve the experience for customer on our web site and to add hotel supply also contributed to the strong performance in our business grows in size it becomes increasingly more difficult to maintain high growth rate and therefore we believe that our year on year room night reservation growth rate will generally but not always decelerate on quarterly sequential basis in future period large established internet search engine with substantial resource and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating internet traffic are creating and intend to further create inroad into online travel both in the and internationally for example google recently announced that it ha entered into an agreement to acquire ita software inc major flight information software company which could allow google to pursue the creation of new flight search tool which will enable user to find flight information on the internet without using service like ours google ha also invested in homeaway vacation home rental service in addition google ha launched travel meta search site to show searcher specific hotel and rate in addition to text advertisement and microsoft ha launched bing travel meta search site which search for airfare and hotel reservation online and predicts the best time to purchase them meta search site leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search result for the searcher specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other website and in many instance compete directly with for customer these initiative among others illustrate google and bing clear intention to more directly appeal to travel consumer by showing consumer more detailed travel search result including specific information for traveler own itinerary which could lead to supplier or others gaining larger share of google or bing traffic or may ultimately lead to search engine maintaining transaction within their own website if google the single largest search engine in the world or bing or other leading search engine refer significant traffic to these or other travel service that they develop in the future it could result in among other thing more competition from supplier website and higher customer acquisition cost for third party site such ours and could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition table of content international trend the size of the travel market outside of the united state is substantially greater than that within the united state historically internet adoption rate and commerce adoption rate of international consumer have trailed those of the united state however international consumer are rapidly moving to online mean for purchasing travel accordingly recent international online travel growth rate have substantially exceeded and are expected to continue to exceed the growth rate within the united state in addition the base of hotel supplier in europe and asia is particularly fragmented compared to that in the united state where the hotel market is dominated by large hotel chain we believe online reservation system like ours may be more appealing to small chain and independent hotel more commonly found outside of the united state we believe these trend and factor have enabled to become the top online hotel service provider in the world our international operation have become significant contributor to our result and international hotel booking have become of increased importance to our earnings we have seen and expect to continue to see change in certain of our operating expense and other financial metric for example because booking com and agoda utilize online search and affiliate marketing the principal mean of generating traffic to their website our online advertising expense ha increased significantly over recent year trend we expect to continue throughout in addition and discussed in more detail below we have seen the effect of seasonal fluctuation on our operating result change result of different revenue recognition policy that apply to our price disclosed service including our international hotel service compared to our name your own price service another impact of the growing importance of booking com agoda and traveljigsaw is our increased exposure to foreign currency exchange risk because we are conducting significant and growing portion of our business outside the united state and are reporting our result in dollar we face exposure to adverse movement in currency exchange rate the financial result of our international operation are translated from local currency principally the euro and the british pound sterling into dollar upon consolidation our international operation contributed approximately billion to our revenue for the year ended december which compare to million for the year ended december year over year growth of approximately revenue attributable to our international operation increased on local currency basis by approximately in the year ended december compared to the same period in in the fourth quarter of the dollar wa stronger against the euro and the british pound sterling relative to the fourth quarter of which negatively impacted the growth rate of our euro and british pound sterling denominated gross booking gross profit and net income expressed in dollar in early greece and certain other european union country with high level of sovereign debt had difficulty refinancing that debt and central bank intervention wa required causing significant devaluation of the euro relative to other currency such the dollar and concern that sovereign default could lead to devaluation or abandonment of the common currency sovereign debt issue could lead to further significant and potentially longer term devaluation of the euro against the dollar which would adversely impact our euro denominated net asset gross booking revenue operating expense and net income expressed in dollar in addition many government around the world including the government are operating at very large financial deficit disruption in the economy of such government could cause contribute to or be indicative of deteriorating macro economic condition furthermore governmental austerity measure aimed at reducing deficit could impair the economic recovery and adversely affect travel demand we generally enter into derivative instrument to minimize the impact of short term currency fluctuation on our consolidated operating result such derivative instrument are short term in nature and not designed to hedge against currency fluctuation that could impact our foreign currency denominated gross booking revenue or gross profit see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information on our derivative contract domestic trend competition in domestic online travel remains intense and traditional online travel company are creating new promotion and consumer value feature in an effort to gain competitive advantage for example in travelocity launched an opaque price disclosed hotel booking service that allows customer to book room at discount because similar to our name your own price hotel booking service the name of the hotel is not disclosed until after purchase in addition in the fourth quarter of expedia began making opaque hotel room reservation available on it principal website under the name expedia unpublished rate if expedia or travelocity are successful in growing their opaque hotel service our share of the discount hotel market in the could decrease online travel company have also offered consumer value feature such without limitation the elimination and or reduction of processing fee the adoption of best price guarantee and the waiver of cancellation and change fee the elimination of processing fee on retail airline ticket by and our major competitor coupled with the recent significant year over year increase in retail air fare ha led consumer to engage in increased shopping behavior before making purchase increased shopping behavior reduces our advertising efficiency and effectiveness traffic obtained through online advertising becomes le likely to result in purchase on our web site therefore online advertising expense for our priceline com business grew at faster rate than gross profit for the year ended december some travel supplier are encouraging third party travel intermediary such to develop technology to bypass the traditional gd such enabling direct connection to the travel supplier or using alternative global distribution method for example in december american airline terminated it participation in the orbitz service and withdrew it fare from the orbitz website this is consistent with an effort on the part of american airline and the airline industry in general to reduce distribution cost american airline termination of it distribution arrangement with orbitz could be indicative of the airline in general table of content becoming more aggressive toward requiring online travel agent to implement direct connection in addition in december expedia preemptively removed american airline flight from it site it contract with american wa set to expire on december it is feasible that dispute between an airline and gd could lead to an airline removing it fare from the gd despite the fact that such dispute may not involve our business could be adversely affected if we are denied access to airfare in major gd during we implemented direct connection with american airline development and implementation of the technology to enable additional direct connection to travel supplier could cause to incur additional operating expense increase the frequency duration of system problem and delay other project in addition any additional migration toward direct connection would reduce the compensation we receive from gd while demand for online travel service continues to experience annualized growth we believe that the domestic market share of third party distributor like priceline com ha declined over the last several year and that the growth of the domestic online market for travel service ha slowed we believe the decline in market share is attributable in part to concerted initiative by travel supplier to direct customer to their own website in an effort to reduce distribution expense and establish more direct control over their pricing and price advantage in that the supplier generally do not charge processing fee however with the aforementioned elimination and reduction of processing and other fee by all of the major online travel company we believe that the domestic market share of third party distributor stabilized and potentially increased during and domestic airline have recently reduced capacity and increased fare in addition the threat of carrier bankruptcy and the emerging prospect of industry consolidation evidenced by the recent merger of united air line with continental airline and delta air line with northwest airline well the recently announced future acquisition of airtran by southwest airline could lead to additional decrease in capacity and further reduce the amount of airline ticket available to significant increase in average airfare thus far in may adversely impact travel demand reduced airline capacity and demand negatively impact our priceline com air business which in turn ha negative repercussion on our priceline com hotel and rental car business recent decrease in rental car fleet have led to decrease in rental car availability which ha negatively impacted our name your own price rental car service in addition avis is currently in discussion to acquire the dollar thrifty automotive group the merger or acquisition of the dollar thrifty automotive group by avis or another rental car company could result in decrease of rental car reservation available to our rental car service in january toyota recalled over million vehicle due to faulty accelerator pedal leading to further strain on rental car company fleet and increased retail rental car rate result of these challenge we experienced decline in name your own price airline ticket and rental car day during the year ended december compared to the same period in nevertheless we continue to believe that the market for domestic online travel service is an attractive market with continued opportunity for growth table of content we believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain profitability primarily from our hotel business to continue to promote the booking com agoda and traveljigsaw brand internationally and the priceline com brand in the united state and over time to offer other travel service and further expand into other international market factor beyond our control such worldwide recession terrorist attack unusual weather pattern including natural disaster such hurricane tsunami volcanic eruption such the april eruption of volcano in iceland or earthquake and other weather phenomenon travel related health concern including pandemic and epidemic such influenza avian bird flu and sars political instability regional hostility increase in fuel price imposition of tax or surcharge by regulatory authority travel related accident or the withdrawal from our system of major hotel supplier or airline could adversely affect our business and result of operation and impair our ability to effectively implement all or some of the initiative described above for example in early civil unrest in thailand key market for our agoda business and the asian business of booking com negatively impacted booking volume in this market at the time in addition clash involving thai security force anti government demonstrator and group supporting the government resulted in violence in various location in bangkok causing the temporary relocation of agoda thailand based operation thailand ha experienced disruptive civil unrest in prior year well and continued or future civil or political unrest could further disrupt agoda thailand based business and operation we intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion technology and personnel within parameter consistent with attempt to improve operating result we also intend to broaden the scope of our business and to that end we explore strategic alternative from time to time in the form of among other thing merger and acquisition our goal is to improve volume and sustain gross margin in an effort to maintain profitability the uncertain environment described above make the prediction of future result of operation difficult and accordingly we can not provide assurance that we will sustain revenue growth and profitability seasonality our name your own price service are generally non refundable in nature and accordingly we recognize travel revenue at the time booking is generated however we recognize revenue generated from our retail hotel service including booking com and agoda at the time that the customer check out of the hotel result meaningful amount of retail hotel booking generated earlier in the year customer plan and reserve their spring and summer vacation will not be recognized revenue until future quarter in addition revenue generated by traveljigsaw transaction is recognized when the customer return the rental car from cost perspective however we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activity they are incurred which is typically in the quarter in which booking are generated therefore if our retail hotel business continues to grow we expect our quarterly result to become increasingly impacted by these seasonal factor critical accounting policy and estimate management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation are based upon the consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america our significant accounting policy and estimate are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statement certain of our accounting policy and estimate are particularly important to our financial position and result of operation and require to make difficult and subjective judgment often result of the need to make estimate of matter that are inherently uncertain in applying those policy our management us it judgment to determine the appropriate assumption to be used in the determination of certain estimate on an on going basis we evaluate our estimate including those related to the item described below those estimate are based on among other thing historical experience term of existing contract our observance of trend in the travel industry and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance our actual result may differ from these estimate table of content under different assumption or condition our significant accounting policy that involve significant estimate and judgment of management include the following deferred tax valuation allowance we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax asset and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax asset by valuation allowance to the extent we believe portion will not be realized we consider many factor when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax asset including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction expectation of future income the carryforward period available to for tax reporting purpose and other relevant factor based on management assessment of positive and negative evidence we recorded non cash tax benefit in of million resulting from the reversal of portion of our valuation allowance on deferred tax asset the net deferred tax asset at december amounted to million the valuation allowance may need to be adjusted in the future if fact and circumstance change causing reassessment of the amount of deferred tax asset more likely than not to be realized accounting for state and local hotel occupancy tax discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement we are currently involved in over fifty lawsuit brought by or against state city and county over issue involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other tax state and local sale tax and our merchant hotel business we are also involved in one consumer lawsuit relating to among other thing the payment of hotel occupancy tax and service fee in addition over fifty municipality or county and at least nine state have initiated audit proceeding including proceeding initiated by more than forty municipality in california issued proposed tax assessment or started inquiry relating to the payment of hotel occupancy and other tax state and local sale tax additional state and local jurisdiction are likely to assert that we are subject to among other thing hotel occupancy and other tax state and local sale tax and could seek to collect such tax retroactively and or prospectively historically we have not collected hotel occupancy or other tax on the gross profit earned from merchant hotel transaction however in handful of jurisdiction we have been recently required by passage of new statute or court order to start collecting and remitting certain tax local occupancy and or sale tax imposed upon our margin and or service fee the ultimate resolution of these matter in all jurisdiction can not be determined at this time we have established reserve for potential resolution of issue related to hotel occupancy and other tax for prior and current period consistent with applicable accounting principle and in light of all current fact and circumstance we accrue for legal contingency where it is probable that loss ha occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated our legal expense for these matter are expensed incurred and are not reflected in the amount of the reserve variety of factor could affect the amount of the liability both past and future which factor include but are not limited to the number of and amount of gross profit represented by jurisdiction that ultimately assert claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate settlement and change in relevant statute the ultimate resolution of these matter may be greater or le than the liability recorded stock based compensation we record stock based compensation expense for equity based award over the recipient service period based upon the grant date fair value of the award number of our equity award have performance target performance contingency which if satisfied can increase the number of share issued to the recipient at the end of the performance period or in certain instance if not satisfied reduce the number of share issued to the recipient sometimes to zero at the end of the performance period the performance period for our performance based equity award are typically three year we record stock based compensation expense for these table of content performance based award based upon our estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the performance period the estimated performance against the performance target we periodically adjust the cumulative stock based compensation recorded when the probable outcome for these performance based award is updated based upon change in actual and forecasted operating result stock based compensation for the year ended december includes charge amounting to million representing the cumulative impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome of unvested performance share unit our actual performance against the performance target could differ materially from our estimate we record stock based compensation expense net of estimated forfeiture in determining the estimated forfeiture rate we periodically review actual and projected forfeiture to the extent that actual or projected forfeiture rate differ from current estimate such amount are recorded cumulative adjustment in the period in which the estimate is revised allowance for doubtful account booking com earns agency commission from hotel transaction and because some commission are not paid we are therefore subject to potential write offs we provide an allowance for doubtful account based upon the age of the commission receivables taking into consideration past experience and current trend in addition because we are the merchant of record in name your own price and price disclosed merchant transaction we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit card on our website well other payment dispute with our customer we are also held liable for accepting fraudulent credit card in certain retail transaction when we do not act merchant of record accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge back based upon past experience and current trend the ultimate resolution of these matter may be greater or le than the reserve recorded valuation of goodwill we have recorded goodwill related to business we have acquired goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment using appropriate valuation technique in the event that future circumstance indicate that any portion of our goodwill is impaired an impairment charge would be recorded substantial amount of our goodwill relates to our acquisition of booking com the estimated fair value for booking com well the company other reporting unit is substantially in excess of their respective carrying value since the annual impairment test in september there have been no event or change in circumstance to indicate potential impairment valuation of long lived asset and intangible we evaluate whether event or circumstance have occurred which indicate that the carrying amount of long lived asset and intangible may be impaired the significant factor that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include change in business strategy market

respect to jurisdiction that have not initiated proceeding to date it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statute and seek to collect tax from only on prospective basis see item legal proceeding table of content and note to the consolidated financial statement for description of these pending case and proceeding and item risk factor adverse application of state and local tax law could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation in this annual report we are vigorously defending against these claim and proceeding however litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse development in these pending or future case and proceeding an unfavorable outcome or settlement of these action or proceeding could result in substantial liability for past and or future booking including among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost which could have material adverse effect on our cash flow in any given operating period also there have been and will continue to be ongoing cost associated with defending our position in pending and any future case or proceeding to the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that we have tax collection responsibility or we determine that we have one with respect to future transaction we may collect any such additional tax obligation from our customer which would have the effect of increasing the cost of hotel room reservation to our customer and consequently could make our hotel service le competitive versus the website of other online travel company or hotel company website and reduce hotel reservation transaction alternatively we could choose to reduce the compensation for our service on merchant hotel transaction either

hotel related transaction tax refer to note to the consolidated financial statement and million related to unrecognized tax benefit refer to note to the consolidated financial statement variety of factor could affect the timing of payment for these liability we believe that these matter will likely not be resolved in the next twelve month and accordingly we have classified the estimated liability non current on the consolidated balance sheet we have excluded other long term liability in the amount of million from the contractual obligation table because we can not reasonably estimate the timing of such payment the contingent conversion threshold on the note wa not exceeded at december and therefore that debt is reported non current liability the determination of whether the note are convertible must continue to be performed on quarterly basis these note may become convertible at the option of the holder prior to their stated maturity date of march if the closing price of our common stock exceeds the contingent conversion threshold for the prescribed measurement period see note to the consolidated financial statement table of content in connection with our acquisition of agoda in contingent consideration of up to million wa payable in if agoda achieved specified gross booking and earnings target for the period of january through december based upon actual result for the three year period ended december we recorded liability and increased goodwill by million this treatment did not impact the consolidated statement of cash flow for this amount will be reflected an investing cash outflow when it is paid in in september we entered into million five year committed revolving credit facility with group of lender which is secured subject to certain exception by first priority security interest on substantially all of our asset and related intangible asset located in the united state in addition our obligation under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by substantially all of the asset and related intangible asset of our material direct and indirect domestic and foreign subsidiary borrowing under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at our

fee at the applicable rate ranging from to the revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of up to million of letter of credit well borrowing on same day notice referred to swingline loan which are available in dollar euro british pound sterling and any other foreign currency agreed to by the lender the proceeds of loan made under the facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purpose of december there were no borrowing outstanding under the facility and we have issued approximately million of letter of credit under the revolving credit facility we believe that our existing cash balance and liquid resource will be sufficient to fund our operating activity capital expenditure and other obligation through at least the next twelve month however if during that period or thereafter we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operation or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amount and on term acceptable to we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditure and scale back the scope of our business plan either of which could have material adverse effect on our future financial condition or result of operation if additional fund were raised through the issuance of equity security the percentage ownership of our then current stockholder would be diluted there are no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operation in the future that revenue growth or sustained profitability will be realized or that future borrowing or equity sale will be available in amount sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditure finance our strategy or repay our indebtedness off balance sheet arrangement of december we did not have any off balance sheet arrangement that have or are reasonably likely to have current or future effect on our financial condition result of operation liquidity capital expenditure or capital resource table of content item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policy and procedure and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instrument we use foreign exchange derivative contract to manage short term foreign currency risk the objective of our policy is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and fair value exposure resulting from possible future adverse fluctuation in rate we evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near term and long term fluctuation in interest rate and foreign exchange rate this evaluation includes the review of leading market indicator discussion with financial analyst and investment banker regarding current and future economic condition and the review of market projection to expected future rate we utilize this information to determine our own investment strategy well to determine if the use of derivative financial instrument is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face our policy doe not allow speculation in derivative instrument for profit or execution of derivative instrument contract for which there are no underlying exposure we do not use financial instrument for trading purpose and are not party to any leveraged derivative we did not experience any material change in interest rate exposure during the year ended december based upon economic condition and leading market indicator at december we do not foresee significant adverse change in interest rate in the near future however we performed sensitivity analysis to determine the impact change in interest rate would have on the fair value of our available for sale investment assuming an adverse change of basis point hypothetical basis point increase in interest rate would have resulted in decrease in the fair value of our investment of december of approximately million these hypothetical loss would only be realized if we sold the investment prior to their maturity of december the outstanding principal amount of our debt is approximately million we estimate that the market value of such debt wa approximately billion of december substantial portion of the market value of our debt in excess of the carrying value is related to the conversion premium on the bond result of the acquisition of booking com agoda and traveljigsaw we are conducting significant and growing portion of our business outside the united state through subsidiary with functional currency other than the dollar primarily euro result we face exposure to adverse movement in currency exchange rate the financial result of our international operation are translated from local currency into dollar upon consolidation if the dollar weakens against the local currency the translation of these foreign currency denominated balance will result in increased net asset net revenue operating expense and net income or loss similarly our net asset net revenue operating expense and net income or loss will decrease if the dollar strengthens against local currency additionally foreign exchange rate fluctuation on transaction denominated in currency other than the functional currency result in gain and loss that are reflected in the consolidated statement of operation booking com agoda and traveljigsaw are subject to risk typical of international business including but not limited to differing economic condition change in political climate differing tax structure other regulation and restriction and foreign exchange rate volatility from time to time we enter into foreign exchange derivative contract to minimize the impact of short term foreign currency fluctuation on our consolidated operating result our derivative contract principally address foreign exchange fluctuation risk for the euro of december derivative with notional value of million euro that are not designated hedging instrument for accounting purpose resulting in liability of million are recorded in accrued expense and other current liability in the consolidated balance sheet foreign exchange derivative outstanding of december table of content associated with foreign currency transaction risk that are not designated hedging instrument for accounting purpose resulted in an asset of million recorded in prepaid expense and other current asset in the consolidated balance sheet of december there were no outstanding contract for derivative not designated hedging instrument foreign exchange gain of million and million for the year ended december and respectively and foreign exchange loss of million for the year ended december were recorded in foreign currency transaction and other related to foreign exchange derivative contract hypothetical strengthening of the foreign exchange rate relative to the dollar with all other variable held constant would have resulted in derivative liability balance of approximately million of december of december and we had outstanding forward currency contract with notional value of million euro and million euro respectively to hedge portion of our net investment in foreign subsidiary these contract are all short term in nature mark to market adjustment on these net investment hedge are recorded currency translation adjustment the net
