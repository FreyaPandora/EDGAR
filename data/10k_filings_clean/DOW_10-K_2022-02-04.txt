not to complete qualitative testing for given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying value additional quantitative testing is required quantitative testing requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be compared with it carrying value if the reporting unit carrying value exceeds it fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the difference the company utilizes discounted cash flow methodology to calculate the fair value of it reporting unit this valuation technique ha been selected by management the most meaningful valuation method due to the limited number of market comparables for the company reporting unit however where market comparables are available the company includes ebit ebitda multiple part of the reporting unit valuation analysis the discounted cash flow valuation are completed using the following key assumption projected revenue growth rate or compounded annual growth rate discount rate tax rate terminal value currency exchange rate and forecasted long term hydrocarbon and energy price by geographic region and by year which include the company key feedstock well natural gas and crude oil due to it correlation to naphtha currency exchange rate and long term hydrocarbon and energy price are established for the company whole and applied consistently to all reporting unit while revenue growth rate discount rate and tax rate are established by reporting unit to account for difference in business fundamental and industry risk these key assumption drive projected ebit ebitda and ebit ebitda margin which are key element of management internal control over the reporting unit valuation analysis goodwill impairment testing in there were no event or change in circumstance that warranted interim goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of qualitative testing wa performed for all reporting unit carrying goodwill based on the result of the qualitative testing the company did not perform quantitative testing on any reporting unit for the qualitative testing management considered factor at both

settled at december rate of increase in future compensation level mortality rate and health care cost trend rate these assumption are updated annually and are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statement in accordance with gaap actual result that differ from the assumption are accumulated and amortized over future period and therefore affect expense recognized and obligation recorded in future period the pension plan represent percent of the company pension plan asset and percent of the pension obligation the company us the spot rate approach to determine the discount rate utilized to measure the service cost and interest cost component of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost for the and other selected country under the spot rate approach the company calculates service cost and interest cost by applying individual spot rate from the willis tower watson rate link yield curve based on high quality corporate bond yield for each selected country to the separate expected cash flow component of service cost and interest cost service cost and interest cost for all other plan including all plan prior to adoption are determined on the basis of the single equivalent discount rate derived in determining those plan obligation the following information relates to the plan only similar approach is used for the company non plan the company determines the expected long term rate of return on asset by performing detailed analysis of historical and expected return based on the strategic asset allocation approved by the company investment committee and the underlying return fundamental of each asset class the company historical experience with the pension fund asset performance is also considered the expected return of each asset class is derived from forecasted future return confirmed by historical experience the expected long term rate of return is an assumption and not is expected to be earned in any one particular year the weighted average long term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for wa percent the weighted average assumption to be used for determining net periodic pension expense is percent future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance change in future discount rate and various other factor related to the population of participant in the company pension plan the discount rate utilized to measure the pension and other postretirement obligation of the plan are based on the yield on high quality corporate fixed income investment at the measurement date future expected actuarially determined cash flow for the company plan are individually discounted at the spot rate under the willis tower watson rate link corporate yield curve based on to percentile high quality corporate bond yield to arrive at the plan obligation of the measurement date the weighted average discount rate utilized to measure pension obligation increased to percent at december from percent at december at december the tax qualified plan were underfunded on projected benefit obligation basis by million the underfunded amount decreased million compared with december the decrease in the underfunded amount in wa primarily due to the impact of higher discount rate overall favorable asset return billion contribution to the tax qualified pension plan and plan design change the assumption for the long term rate for compensation level for the tax qualified plan wa unchanged the company us generational mortality table to determine the duration of it pension and other postretirement obligation of contentsthe following discussion relates to the company significant pension plan the company base the determination of pension expense on market related valuation of plan asset that reduces year to year volatility this market related valuation recognizes investment gain or loss over five year period from the year in which they occur investment gain or loss for this purpose represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of plan asset and the actual return based on the market value of plan asset since the market related value of plan asset recognizes gain or loss over five year period the future value will be impacted when previously deferred gain or loss are recorded over the life of the plan both gain and loss have been recognized and amortized at december net gain of million remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of plan asset these net gain will result in decrease in future pension expense they are recognized in the market related value of asset the net increase in the market related value of asset due to the recognition of prior gain is presented in the following table net increase in market related asset value due to recognition of prior gainsin total exclusive of one time curtailment gain recognized in the company expects pension expense to decrease in by approximately million the decrease is driven by reduction in the amortization of actuarial loss basis point increase or decrease in the long term return on asset assumption would change the company total pension expense for by million basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would decrease the company total pension expense for by million basis point decrease in the

and risk related to the physical impact of climate change physical risk transition riskstransition risk include carbon pricing mechanism transition to lower greenhouse gas emission technology increased cost of raw material and mandate on and regulation of existing product and service carbon pricing is market based strategy to address climate change by putting monetary value on greenhouse gas emission allowing for the cost of climate impact and opportunity for low carbon energy option to be reflected in production and consumption choice approximately percent of dow scope and greenhouse gas emission are generated from operation in canada and the european union eu where carbon pricing is already in place part of the european green deal the european commission proposed greenhouse gas emission reduction target of at least percent below level with goal for the eu to be carbon neutral by in china an emission trading system initially proposed to cover the power sector only is expected to gradually expand to cover total of eight sector including the petrochemical and chemical industry though no specific timeline for implementation and expansion ha been outlined these carbon pricing mechanism will not only increase dow direct cost to operate but will also result in increased energy cost dow mitigates the direct cost impact of existing regulation through research and of

including defense and processing cost reflect reasonable and probable estimate of the liability based upon current known fact however future event such the number of new claim to be filed and or received each year the average cost of defending and disposing of each such claim well the numerous uncertainty surrounding asbestos litigation in the united state over significant period of time could cause the actual cost for union carbide to be higher or lower than those projected or those recorded any such event could result in an increase or decrease in the recorded liability because of the uncertainty described above union carbide can not estimate the full range of the cost of resolving pending and future asbestos related claim facing union carbide and amchem result it is reasonably
