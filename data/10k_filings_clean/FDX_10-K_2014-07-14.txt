price we obtain for our service primarily measured by yield revenue per package or pound or revenue per hundredweight and shipment for ltl freight shipment our ability to manage our cost structure capital expenditure and operating expense to match shifting volume level and the timing and amount of fluctuation in fuel price and our ability to recover incremental fuel cost through our fuel surcharge the majority of our operating expense are directly impacted by revenue and volume level accordingly we expect these operating expense to fluctuate on year over year basis consistent with the change in revenue and volume therefore the discussion of operating expense caption focus on the key driver and trend impacting expense other than change in revenue and volume the line item other

repurchase program in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement our result include business realignment cost of million primarily related to our voluntary cash buyout program furthermore in we retired from service aircraft and related engine which resulted in noncash asset impairment charge of million these item negatively impacted our earnings by per diluted share beyond these factor our result for benefited from the strong performance of fedex ground which continued to grow market share and ongoing profit improvement at fedex freight however decline in profitability wa experienced at our fedex express segment resulting from ongoing shift in demand from our priority international service to economy international service which could not be fully offset by network

higher volume from market share gain and increased yield result of rate increase revenue at fedex freight increased during primarily due to higher average daily ltl shipment and revenue per ltl shipment at fedex express revenue were flat lower fuel surcharge and lower freight revenue were offset by revenue growth in our base and international export package business and growth in our freight forwarding business at fedex trade network the continuing demand shift from our priority international service to our economy international service dampened revenue growth at fedex express revenue increased in primarily driven by increase in international domestic revenue at fedex express and volume growth at fedex ground at fedex ground revenue increased in primarily due to volume growth from market share gain at fedex express revenue increased due to increase in international domestic revenue from recent acquisition and growth in our freight forwarding business at fedex trade network base

express including recent business acquisition at fedex express higher utilization of third party transportation provider at fedex freight and the expansion of our freight forwarding business at fedex trade network depreciation and amortization expense increased in primarily due to accelerated depreciation on certain aircraft scheduled for retirement and aircraft recently placed in service at fedex express salary and employee benefit expense in wa flat due to the benefit from our voluntary employee buyout program lower pension expense the delayed timing or absence of merit increase for many of our employee and reduced variable incentive compensation maintenance and repair decreased in due to network adjustment at fedex express and the continued modernization of our aircraft fleet which impacted the timing of certain maintenance event table of content the following graph for our transportation segment show our average cost of jet and vehicle fuel per gallon for the year ended may fuel expense decreased during primarily due to lower average price per gallon of jet fuel and lower aircraft fuel usage our fuel surcharge which are more fully described in the quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk section of this md have timing lag and are designed to pas through the price of fuel not included in our base shipping rate to our customer our result are affected by the net impact of fuel which is the fuel surcharge timing lag that exists between when fuel price change and when indexed fuel surcharge automatically adjust based on static analysis of the impact to operating income of year over year change in fuel price compared to year over year change in fuel surcharge fuel had significant negative impact on operating income in our analysis considers the estimated impact of the reduction in fuel surcharge included in the base rate charged for fedex express and fedex ground service however this analysis doe not consider the negative effect that fuel surcharge level may have on our business including reduced demand and shift by our customer to lower yielding service while fluctuation in fuel surcharge rate can be significant from period to period fuel surcharge represent one of the many individual component of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield additional component include the mix of service sold the base price and extra service charge we obtain for these service and the level of pricing discount offered in order to provide information about the impact of fuel surcharge on the trend in revenue and yield growth we have included the comparative fuel surcharge rate in effect for and in the accompanying discussion of each of our transportation segment in our operating income and operating margin decreased primarily due to the impact of business realignment cost aircraft impairment charge and accelerated aircraft depreciation beyond these factor operating income wa positively impacted in by higher volume and increased yield at our fedex ground segment and by increased yield and higher volume at our fedex freight segment however the ongoing shift in demand from priority international service to economy international service and lower rate resulted in substantial decline in profitability at fedex express purchased transportation increased in due to volume growth at fedex ground international business acquisition during the year and the expansion of our freight forwarding business at fedex trade network salary and benefit increased in primarily due to increase in pension and group health insurance cost partially offset by lower incentive compensation accrual other expense increased in primarily due to the impact of international acquisition and the reversal in

qualifying investment such our boeing freighter aircraft these were timing benefit only in that depreciation benefit accelerated into an earlier year are foregone in later year for we expect our effective tax rate to be between and the actual rate however will depend on number of factor including the amount and source of operating income we also expect our current federal income tax expense to increase in due to expected higher earnings along with other item such lower accelerated depreciation benefit additional information on income tax including our effective tax rate reconciliation liability for uncertain tax position and our global tax profile can be found in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement business acquisition on may we expanded the international

fedex express segment from the date of acquisition and were not material individually or in the aggregate to our result of operation and therefore pro forma financial information ha not been presented profit improvement program during we announced profit improvement program primarily through initiative at fedex express and fedex service targeting annual profitability improvement of billion at fedex express we expect the majority of the benefit from our profit improvement program to occur in and our various cost reduction and efficiency initiative gain traction our plan position fedex express to exit with run rate of billion in additional operating profit from the base business our ability to achieve the profit improvement target and other benefit from these program is dependent upon number of factor including the health of the global economy and future customer demand during we completed program to offer voluntary cash buyout to eligible based employee in certain staff function result of this program approximately employee left the company cost of the benefit provided under the voluntary employee severance program were recognized in when eligible employee accepted their offer payment under this program were made at the time of departure and totaled approximately million in and million in the cost of the program is included in the caption business realignment impairment and other charge in our consolidated statement of income also included in that caption are other external cost directly attributable to our business realignment activity such professional fee see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement for further discussion of the voluntary employee severance program in addition see the long lived asset section of our critical accounting estimate for discussion of fleet modernization action taken in and outlook we anticipate revenue and earnings growth in driven by ongoing improvement in the result of all of our transportation segment our expectation for moderate global economic growth drive volume and yield improvement our result in will benefit from continued execution of the profit improvement program noted above including our voluntary employee severance program this program provided modest benefit in due to the staggered nature of the employee departure date however the full benefit of the voluntary severance program will be realized in our earnings per share result for will also benefit from our share repurchase program announced in benefit of approximately per diluted share and lower pension expense due to strong asset return in our expectation for earnings growth in are dependent on key external factor including fuel price and the pace of improvement in the global economy our capital expenditure for are expected to increase to approximately billion for additional aircraft delivery in to support our fleet modernization program and continued expansion of the fedex ground network we will continue to evaluate our investment in critical long term strategic project to ensure our capital expenditure generate high return on investment and are balanced with our outlook for global economic condition for additional detail on key capital project refer to the capital resource and liquidity outlook section of this md table of content our outlook assumes no year over year net fuel impact and is dependent upon stable pricing environment for fuel volatility in fuel price impact our fuel surcharge level fuel expense and demand for our service historically our fuel surcharge have largely offset incremental fuel cost however volatility in fuel cost may impact earnings because adjustment to our fuel surcharge lag change in actual fuel price paid for example we purchase jet fuel on global basis with pricing term correlated to four primary jet fuel index therefore the trailing impact of adjustment to our fuel surcharge can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short term described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement and the independent contractor model section of our fedex ground segment md we are involved in number of lawsuit and other proceeding that challenge the status of fedex ground owner operator independent contractor fedex ground anticipates continuing change to it relationship with it owner operator the nature timing and amount of any change are dependent on the outcome of numerous future event we can not reasonably estimate the potential impact of any such change or meaningful range of potential outcome although they could be material however we do not believe that any such change will impair our ability to operate and profitably grow our fedex ground business see risk factor for discussion of these and other potential risk and uncertainty that could materially affect our future performance seasonality of business our business are cyclical in nature seasonal fluctuation affect volume revenue and earnings historically the express package business experience an increase in volume in late november and december international business particularly in the asia to market peak in october and november in advance of the holiday sale season our first and third fiscal quarter because they are summer vacation and post winter holiday season have historically experienced lower volume relative to other period normally the fall is the busiest shipping period for fedex ground while late december june and july are the slowest period for fedex freight the spring and fall are the busiest period and the latter part of december through february is the slowest period for fedex office the summer month are normally the slowest period shipment level operating cost and earnings for each of our company can also be adversely affected by inclement weather particularly the impact of severe winter weather in our third fiscal quarter recent accounting guidance new accounting rule and disclosure requirement can significantly impact our reported result and the comparability of our financial statement on june we adopted the authoritative guidance issued by the financial accounting standard board fasb requiring additional information about reclassification adjustment out of accumulated other comprehensive income including change in accumulated other comprehensive income balance by component and significant item reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income we have adopted this guidance by including expanded accumulated other comprehensive income disclosure requirement in note of our consolidated financial statement on may the fasb and international accounting standard board issued new accounting standard that will supersede virtually all existing revenue recognition guidance under gaap and international financial reporting standard this standard will be effective for beginning in fiscal the fundamental principle of the new guidance are that company should recognize revenue in manner that reflects the timing of the transfer of service to customer and the amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that company expects to receive for the good and service provided the new guidance establishes five step approach for the recognition of revenue based on our preliminary assessment we do not anticipate that the new guidance will fundamentally change

usage based on static analysis of the net impact of year over year change in fuel price compared to year over year change in fuel surcharge fuel had slightly positive impact in fedex express segment outlook we expect revenue and earnings to increase at fedex express during primarily due to improved domestic and international export package yield we continue to focus on revenue quality while

the preparation of financial statement in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state requires management to make significant judgment and estimate to develop amount reflected and disclosed in the financial statement in many case there are alternative policy or estimation technique that could be used we maintain thorough process to review the application of our accounting policy and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimate that are required to prepare the financial statement of complex global corporation however even under optimal circumstance estimate routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstance and new or better information the estimate discussed below include the financial statement element that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policy and are material to our financial statement management ha discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of director and with our independent registered public accounting firm table of content retirement plan overview we sponsor program that provide retirement benefit to most of our employee these program include defined benefit pension plan defined contribution plan and postretirement healthcare plan and are described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement the current rule for pension accounting are complex and can produce tremendous volatility in our result financial condition and liquidity our pension expense is primarily function of the value of our plan asset and the discount rate used to measure our pension liability at single point in time these factor are significantly influenced by the financial market which in recent year have experienced substantial volatility in addition to expense volatility we are required to record year end adjustment to our balance sheet on an annual basis for the net funded status of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan these adjustment have fluctuated significantly over the past several year and like our pension expense are result of the discount rate and value of our plan asset at the measurement date the funded status of our plan also impact our liquidity and the cash funding rule operate under completely different set of assumption and standard than those used for financial reporting purpose result our actual cash funding requirement can differ materially from our reported funded status our retirement plan cost is included in the salary and employee benefit caption in our consolidated income statement summary of our retirement plan cost over the past three year is follows in million domestic and international pension plan domestic and international defined contribution plan domestic and international postretirement healthcare plan total retirement plan cost decreased million in due to the favorable impact of higher discount rate at our may measurement date and higher return on plan asset total retirement plan cost increased million in driven by lower discount rate used to measure our benefit obligation at our may measurement date amount recognized in our balance sheet reflect snapshot of the state of our long term pension liability at the plan measurement date and the effect of year end accounting on plan asset cumulative unrecognized actuarial loss were billion through may compared to billion through may these unrecognized loss reflect change in the discount rate and other assumption and difference between expected and actual asset return which are being amortized over future period these unrecognized loss may be recovered in future period through actuarial gain however unless they are below corridor amount these unrecognized actuarial loss are required to be amortized and recognized in future period our pension plan expense includes amortization of these actuarial loss of million in million in and million in pension cost the accounting for pension and postretirement healthcare plan includes numerous assumption including the discount rate and expected long term investment return on plan asset these assumption most significantly impact our pension plan table of content following is discussion of the key estimate we consider in determining our pension plan cost discount rate this is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payment that have been accrued to date the projected benefit obligation or pbo to their net present value and to determine the succeeding year pension expense the discount rate is determined each year at the plan measurement date decrease in the discount rate increase pension expense the discount rate affect the pbo and pension expense based on the measurement date described below measurement date discount rate amount determined by measurement date and discount rate pbo and expense pbo and expense pbo and expense pbo and expense we determine the discount rate with the assistance of actuary who calculate the yield on theoretical portfolio of high grade corporate bond rated aa or better in developing this theoretical portfolio we select bond that match cash flow to benefit payment limit our concentration by industry and issuer and apply screening criterion to ensure bond with call feature have low probability of being called to the extent scheduled bond proceeds exceed the estimated benefit payment in given period the calculation assumes those excess proceeds are reinvested at one year forward rate the discount rate assumption is highly sensitive one basis point change in the discount rate for our largest pension plan would have million effect on and pension expense at our may measurement date basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased our pbo by approximately billion and basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased our pbo by approximately billion from to the discount rate used to value our liability ha declined by over basis point which increased the valuation of our liability by over billion plan asset the estimated average rate of return on plan asset is long term forward looking assumption that also materially affect our pension cost it is required to be the expected future long term rate of earnings on plan asset our pension plan asset are invested primarily in publicly tradeable security and our pension plan hold only minimal investment in fedex common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third party pension fund investment manager part of our strategy to manage pension cost and funded status volatility we have transitioned to liability driven investment strategy to better align plan asset with liability establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension asset is judgmental matter which we review on an annual basis and revise appropriate management considers the following factor in determining this assumption the duration of our pension plan liability which drive the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan asset the type of investment class in which we invest our pension plan asset and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment class to earn over time and the investment return we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the return we could expect if investment were made strictly in indexed fund we assumed expected long term rate of return on our pension plan asset in and in and the actual return during each of the last three fiscal year have exceeded those long term assumption for we lowered our expected return on plan asset assumption for long term return on plan asset to we refined our asset and liability management strategy in lowering this assumption we considered our historical return our investment strategy for our plan asset including the impact of the duration of our plan liability and the relatively low annual draw on plan asset on that investment strategy one basis point change in our expected return on plan asset impact our pension expense by million the actual historical annual return on our pension plan asset calculated on compound geometric basis wa net of investment manager fee and administrative expense for the year period ended may and net of investment manager fee and administrative expense for the year period ended may table of content pension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan asset at the measurement date we use calculated value method to determine the value of plan asset which help mitigate short term volatility in market performance both increase and decrease by amortizing certain actuarial gain or loss over period no longer than four year another method used in practice applies the market value of plan asset at the measurement date for purpose of valuing plan asset for determining pension expense the calculated value method resulted in the same value the market value our retirement plan cost are expected to decrease approximately million in strong return on our pension plan asset more than offset the negative impact of decrease in our discount rate at our may measurement date funded status following is information concerning the funded status of our pension plan of may in million funded status of plan projected benefit obligation pbo fair value of plan asset funded status of the plan cash amount cash contribution during the year benefit payment during the year funding the funding requirement for our pension plan are governed by the pension protection act of which ha aggressive funding requirement in order to avoid benefit payment restriction that become effective if the funded status determined under irs rule fall below at the beginning of plan year all of our pension plan have funded status level in excess of and our plan remain adequately funded to provide benefit to our employee they come due additionally current benefit payment are nominal compared to our total plan asset benefit payment for our pension plan for were approximately million or of plan asset during we made million in required contribution to our pension plan over the past several year we have made voluntary contribution to our pension plan in excess of the minimum required contribution amount contributed in excess of the minimum required can result in credit balance for funding purpose that can be used to reduce minimum contribution requirement in future year our current credit balance exceeds billion at may for we anticipate making required contribution to our pension plan totaling approximately million see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement for further information about our retirement plan self insurance accrual we are self insured up to certain limit for cost associated with worker compensation claim vehicle accident and general business liability and benefit paid under employee healthcare and long term disability program our reserve are established for estimate of loss on reported claim including incurred but not reported claim self insurance accrual reflected in our balance sheet were billion at may and billion at may approximately of these accrual were classified current liability table of content our self insurance accrual are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claim incurred of the balance sheet date these estimate include consideration of factor such severity of claim frequency and volume of claim healthcare inflation seasonality and plan design cost trend on material accrual are updated each quarter we self insure up to certain limit that vary by operating company and type of risk periodically we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance level based on risk tolerance and premium expense historically it ha been infrequent that incurred claim exceeded our self insured limit we believe the use of actuarial method to account for these liability provides consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accrual however the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claim involved and the length of time the ultimate cost is known we believe our recorded obligation for these expense are consistently measured on conservative basis nevertheless change in healthcare cost accident frequency and severity insurance retention level and other factor can materially affect the estimate for these liability long lived asset useful life and salvage value our business is capital intensive with approximately of our total asset invested in our transportation and information system infrastructure the depreciation or amortization of our capital asset over their estimated useful life and the determination of any salvage value requires management to make judgment about future event because we utilize many of our capital asset over relatively long period the majority of aircraft cost are depreciated over to year we periodically evaluate whether adjustment to our estimated service life or salvage value are necessary to ensure these estimate properly match the economic use of the asset this evaluation may result in change in the estimated life and residual value used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment for our aircraft we typically assign no residual value due to the utilization of these asset in cargo configuration which result in little to no value at the end of their useful life these estimate affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in period and ultimately the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset change in the estimated life of asset will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future period and could have material impact on our result of operation described below historically gain and loss on disposal of operating equipment have not been material however such amount may differ materially in the future due to change in business level technological obsolescence accident frequency regulatory change and other factor beyond our control in fedex express made the decision to accelerate the retirement of aircraft and related engine to aid in our fleet modernization and improve our global network in we shortened the depreciable life for aircraft and related engine to accelerate the retirement of these aircraft resulting in depreciation expense increase of million in result of these accelerated retirement we incurred an additional million in year over year accelerated depreciation expense in impairment the fedex express global air and ground network includes fleet of aircraft including approximately supplemental aircraft that provide delivery of package and freight to more than country and territory through wide range of and international shipping service while certain aircraft are utilized in primary geographic area versus international we operate an integrated global network and utilize our aircraft and other mode of transportation to achieve the lowest cost of delivery while maintaining our service commitment to our customer because of the integrated nature of our global network our aircraft are interchangeable across route and geography giving flexibility with our fleet planning to meet changing global economic condition and maintain and modify aircraft needed because of the lengthy lead time for aircraft manufacture and modification we must anticipate volume level and plan our fleet requirement year in advance and make commitment for aircraft based on those projection furthermore the timing and availability of certain used aircraft type particularly those with better fuel efficiency may create limited opportunity to acquire these aircraft at favorable price in advance of our capacity need these activity create risk that asset capacity may exceed demand and that an impairment of our asset may occur aircraft purchase primarily aircraft in passenger configuration that have not been table of content placed in service totaled million at may and million at may we plan to modify these asset in the future and place them into operation the accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with it estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the cash flow do not exceed the carrying value the asset must be adjusted to it current fair value we operate integrated transportation network and accordingly cash flow for most of our operating asset are assessed at network level not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment further decision about capital investment are evaluated based on the impact to the overall network rather than the return on an individual asset we make decision to remove certain long lived asset from service based on projection of reduced capacity need or lower operating cost of newer aircraft type and those decision may result in an impairment charge asset held for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair value le cost to sell when the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criterion are met the fair value determination for such aircraft may require management estimate there may not be active market for some of these aircraft such estimate are subject to revision from period to period in the normal management of our aircraft fleet we routinely idle aircraft and engine temporarily due to maintenance cycle and adjustment of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand level temporarily idled asset are classified available for use and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these asset these temporarily idled asset are assessed for impairment on quarterly basis the criterion for determining whether an asset ha been permanently removed from service and result impaired include but are not limited to our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume level including capacity need during our peak shipping season the introduction of new fleet type or decision to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operation or change to planned service expansion activity at may we had aircraft temporarily idled one of which wa fully depreciated these aircraft have been idled for an average of three month and are expected to return to revenue service in we retired from service two airbus aircraft and four related engine three airbus aircraft and two related engine and five boeing aircraft and related engine to align with the plan of fedex express to modernize it aircraft fleet and improve it global network consequence of this decision noncash impairment charge of million million net of tax or per diluted share wa recorded in all of these aircraft were temporarily idled and not in revenue service lease we utilize operating lease to finance certain of our aircraft facility and equipment such arrangement typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the asset at the end of the lease period to the lessor disclosed in contractual cash obligation and note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement at may we had approximately billion on an undiscounted basis of future commitment for payment under operating lease the weighted average remaining lease term of all operating lease outstanding at may wa approximately six year the future commitment for operating lease are not reflected liability in our balance sheet under current accounting rule the determination of whether lease is accounted for capital lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimate primarily about the fair value of the asset and it estimated economic useful life in addition our evaluation includes ensuring we properly account for build to suit lease arrangement and making judgment about whether various form of lessee involvement during the construction period make the lessee an agent for the owner lessor or in substance the owner of the asset during the construction period we believe we have well defined and controlled process for making these evaluation including obtaining third party appraisal for material transaction to assist in making these evaluation under proposed revision to the accounting standard for lease we would be required to record an asset and liability for our outstanding operating lease similar to the current accounting for capital lease notably the amount we record in the future would be the net present value of our future lease commitment at the date of adoption this proposed guidance ha not been issued and ha been subjected to numerous revision most recently in may while we are not required to quantify the effect of the table of content proposed rule change until they are finalized we believe that majority of our operating lease obligation reflected in the contractual cash obligation table would be required to be reflected in our balance sheet were the proposed rule to be adopted furthermore our existing financing agreement and the rating agency that evaluate our creditworthiness already take our operating lease into account goodwill of may we had billion of recorded goodwill from our business acquisition representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net asset we have acquired several factor give rise to goodwill in our acquisition such the expected benefit from synergy of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business in our evaluation of goodwill impairment we perform qualitative assessment that requires management judgment and the use of estimate to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive we proceed to two step process to test goodwill for impairment including comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying value including attributable goodwill fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodology principally the income or market approach incorporating market participant consideration and management assumption on revenue growth rate operating margin discount rate and expected capital expenditure estimate used by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test change in forecasted operating result and other assumption could materially affect these estimate we perform our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter unless circumstance indicate the need to accelerate the timing of the test our reporting unit with significant recorded goodwill include fedex express fedex freight and fedex office reported in the fedex service segment we evaluated these reporting unit during the fourth quarter of and the estimated fair value of each of these reporting unit exceeded their carrying value in and and we do not believe that any of these reporting unit were at risk of may contingency we are subject to various loss contingency including tax proceeding and litigation in connection with our operation contingent liability are difficult to measure their measurement is subject to multiple factor that are not easily predicted or projected further additional complexity in measuring these liability arises due to the various jurisdiction in which these matter occur which make our ability to predict their outcome highly uncertain moreover different accounting rule must be employed to account for these item based on the nature of the contingency accordingly significant management judgment is required to ass these matter and to make determination about the measurement of liability if any our material pending loss contingency are described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement in the opinion of management the aggregate liability if any of individual matter or group of matter not specifically described in note is not expected to be material to our financial position result of operation or cash flow the following describes our method and associated process for evaluating these matter tax contingency we are subject to income and operating tax rule of the it state and municipality and of the foreign jurisdiction in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining income tax provision well deferred tax asset and liability balance and related deferred tax valuation allowance if necessary due to the complexity of these rule and their interaction with one another we account for income tax by recording both current tax payable and deferred tax asset and liability our provision for income tax is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we operate applied to taxable income reduced by applicable tax credit tax contingency arise from uncertainty in the application of tax rule throughout the many jurisdiction in which we operate and are impacted by several factor including tax audit appeal litigation change in tax law and other rule and their interpretation and change in our business we regularly ass the potential impact of these factor for the current and prior year to determine the adequacy of our tax provision we continually evaluate the likelihood and amount of potential adjustment and adjust our tax position including the current and deferred tax liability in the period in which the fact that give rise to revision become known in addition management considers the advice of third party in making conclusion regarding tax consequence table of content we recognize liability for uncertain income tax position based on two step process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any the second step requires to estimate and measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amount we must determine the probability of various possible outcome we reevaluate these uncertain tax position on quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management these reevaluation are based on factor including but not limited to change in fact or circumstance change in tax law successfully settled issue under audit and new audit activity such change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of tax benefit or an increase to the related provision we classify interest related to income tax liability interest expense and if applicable penalty are recognized component of income tax expense the income tax liability and accrued interest and penalty that are due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented current liability the remaining portion of our income tax liability and accrued interest and penalty are presented noncurrent liability because payment of cash is not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date these noncurrent income tax liability are recorded in the caption other liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet we account for operating tax based on multi state local and foreign taxing jurisdiction rule in those area in which we operate provision for operating tax are estimated based upon these rule asset acquisition and disposal historical spend and other variable these provision are consistently evaluated for reasonableness against compliance and risk factor we measure and record operating tax contingency accrual in accordance with accounting guidance for contingency discussed below this guidance requires an accrual of estimated loss from contingency such tax or other legal proceeding or claim when it is probable that loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated other contingency because of the complex environment in which we operate we are subject to other legal proceeding and claim including those relating to general commercial matter governmental enforcement action employment related claim and fedex ground owner operator accounting guidance for contingency requires an accrual of estimated loss from contingency such tax or other legal proceeding or claim when it is probable the future event or event are likely to occur that loss ha been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated this guidance also requires disclosure of loss contingency matter when in management judgment material loss is reasonably possible or probable during the preparation of our financial statement we evaluate our contingency to determine whether it is probable reasonably possible or remote that liability ha been incurred loss is recognized for all contingency deemed probable and estimable regardless of amount for unresolved contingency with potentially material exposure that are deemed reasonably possible we evaluate whether potential loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated our evaluation of these matter is the result of comprehensive process designed to ensure that accounting recognition of loss or disclosure of these contingency is made in timely manner and involves our legal and accounting personnel well external counsel where applicable the process includes regular communication during each quarter and scheduled meeting shortly before the completion of our financial statement to evaluate any new legal proceeding and the status of existing matter table of content in determining whether loss should be accrued or loss contingency disclosed we evaluate among other factor the current status of each matter within the scope and context of the entire lawsuit or proceeding the lengthy and complex nature of class action matter the procedural status of each matter any opportunity to dispose of lawsuit on it merit before trial motion to dismiss or for summary judgment the amount of time remaining before trial date the status of discovery the status of settlement arbitration or mediation proceeding and our judgment regarding the likelihood of success prior to or at trial in reaching our conclusion with respect to accrual of loss or loss contingency disclosure we take holistic view of each matter based on these factor and the information available prior to the issuance of our financial statement uncertainty with respect to an individual factor or combination of these factor may impact our decision related to accrual or disclosure of loss contingency including conclusion that we are unable to establish an estimate of possible loss or meaningful range of possible loss we update our disclosure to reflect our most current understanding of the contingency at the time we issue our financial statement however event may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of contingency may result in loss to that differs materially from our previously estimated liability or range of possible loss despite the inherent complexity in the accounting and disclosure of contingency we believe that our process are robust and thorough and provide consistent framework for management in evaluating the potential outcome of contingency for proper accounting recognition and disclosure risk factor our financial and operating result are subject to many risk and uncertainty described below we are directly affected by the state of the economy while macro economic risk apply to most company we are particularly vulnerable the transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trend in economic activity our primary business is to transport good so our business level are directly tied to the purchase and production of good key macro economic measurement when individual and company purchase and produce fewer good we transport fewer good and company expand the number of distribution center and move manufacturing closer to consumer market we transport good shorter distance in addition we have relatively high fixed cost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume level moreover we continue to grow our international business we are increasingly affected by the health of the global economy and the typically more volatile economy of emerging market in we saw continued customer preference for slower le costly shipping service particularly for international shipment which had negative impact on profitability at fedex express our business depend on our strong reputation and the value of the fedex brand the fedex brand name symbolizes high quality service reliability and speed fedex is one of the most widely recognized trusted and respected brand in the world and the fedex brand is one of our most important and valuable asset in addition we have strong reputation among customer and the general public for high standard of social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance and ethic the fedex brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sale and marketing tool and we devote significant resource to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activity by our employee contractor or agent such customer service mishap or noncompliance with law could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand with the increase in the use of social medium outlet such youtube and twitter adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly making it increasingly difficult for to defend against damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our service and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and result of operation well require additional resource to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand table of content we rely heavily on information and technology to operate our transportation and business network and any disruption to our technology infrastructure or the internet could harm our operation and our reputation among customer our ability to attract and retain customer and to compete effectively depends in part upon the sophistication and reliability of our technology network including our ability to provide feature of service that are important to our customer external and internal risk such malware code anomaly act of god attempt to penetrate our network transitional challenge in migrating operating company functionality to our fedex enterprise automation platform data leakage and human error pose direct threat to our product service and data any disruption to the internet or our complex global technology infrastructure including those impacting our computer system and fedex com could adversely impact our customer service volume and revenue and result in increased cost these type of adverse impact could also occur in the event the confidentiality integrity or availability of company and customer information wa compromised due to data loss by fedex or trusted third party while we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiative information technology risk management and disaster recovery plan these measure can not fully insulate from technology disruption or data loss and the resulting adverse effect on our operation and financial result additionally the cost and operational consequence of implementing further data or system protection measure could be significant our transportation business are impacted by the price and availability of fuel we must purchase large quantity of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicle and the price and availability of fuel can be unpredictable and beyond our control to date we have been mostly successful in mitigating over time the expense impact of higher fuel cost through our indexed fuel surcharge the amount of the surcharge is closely linked to the market price for fuel if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharge because of competitive pricing pressure or some other reason fuel cost could adversely impact our operating result even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharge high fuel surcharge could move our customer away from our higher yielding express service to our lower yielding deferred or ground service or even reduce customer demand for our service altogether in addition disruption in the supply of fuel could have negative impact on our ability to operate our transportation network our business are capital intensive and we must make capital decision based upon projected volume level we make significant investment in aircraft vehicle technology package handling facility sort equipment copy equipment and other asset to support our transportation and business network we also make significant investment to rebrand integrate and grow the company that we acquire the amount and timing of capital investment depend on various factor including our anticipated volume growth we must make commitment to purchase or modify aircraft year before the aircraft are actually needed we must predict volume level and fleet requirement and make commitment for aircraft based on those projection missing our projection could result in much or too little capacity relative to our shipping volume overcapacity could lead to asset disposition or write down and undercapacity could negatively impact service level for example in we made decision to retire from service certain aircraft and excess aircraft engine and thus recorded noncash impairment charge of million we face intense competition the transportation and business service market are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service especially in period of little or no macro economic growth some of our competitor have more financial resource than we do or they are controlled or subsidized by foreign government which enables them to raise capital more easily we also compete with regional transportation provider that operate smaller and le capital intensive transportation network in addition high volume package shipper are developing in house ground delivery capability which would in turn reduce our revenue and market share we believe we compete effectively with these company for example by providing more reliable service at compensatory price however an irrational pricing environment can limit our ability not only to maintain or increase our price including our fuel surcharge in response to rising fuel cost but also to maintain or grow our market share while we believe we compete effectively through our current service offering if our current competitor or potential future competitor offer broader range of service or more effectively bundle their service or our current customer become competitor it could impede our ability to maintain or grow our market share table of content if we do not effectively operate integrate leverage and grow acquired business our financial result and reputation may suffer our strategy for long term growth productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to make prudent strategic acquisition and to realize the benefit we expect when we make those acquisition in furtherance of this strategy over the past three year we have acquired business in europe latin america and africa while we expect our past and future acquisition to enhance our value proposition to customer and improve our long term profitability there can be no assurance that we will realize our expectation within the time frame we have established if at all or that we can continue to support the value we allocate to these acquired business including their goodwill or other intangible asset labor organization attempt to organize group of our employee from time to time and potential change in labor law could make it easier for them to do so if we are unable to continue to maintain good relationship with our employee and prevent labor organization from organizing group of our employee our operating cost could significantly increase and our operational flexibility could be significantly reduced despite continual organizing attempt by labor union other than the pilot of fedex express all of our employee have thus far chosen not to unionize the congress ha in the past considered adopting change in labor law however that would make it easier for union to organize unit of our employee for example there is always possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employee from the purview of the railway labor act of amended the rla for additional discussion of the rla see part item of this annual report on form under the caption regulation such legislation could expose our customer to the type of service disruption that the rla wa designed to prevent local work stoppage in key area that interrupt the timely flow of shipment of time sensitive high value good throughout our global network such disruption could threaten our ability to provide competitively priced shipping option and ready access to global market there is also the possibility that congress could pas other labor legislation that could adversely affect our company such fedex ground and fedex freight whose employee are governed by the national labor relation act of amended the nlra in addition federal and state governmental agency such the national labor relation board have and may continue to take action that could make it easier for our employee to organize under the rla or nlra finally change to federal or state law governing employee classification could impact the status of fedex ground owner operator independent contractor if fedex ground is compelled to convert it independent contractor to employee labor organization could more easily organize these individual our operating cost could increase materially and we could incur significant capital outlay fedex ground relies on owner operator to conduct it linehaul and pickup and delivery operation and the status of these owner operator independent contractor rather than employee is being challenged fedex ground use of independent contractor is well suited to the need of the ground delivery business and it customer evidenced by the strong growth of this business segment we are involved in numerous lawsuit and state tax and other administrative proceeding that claim that the company owner operator or their driver should be treated our employee rather than independent contractor we incur certain cost including legal fee in defending the status of fedex ground owner operator independent contractor we believe that fedex ground owner operator are properly classified independent contractor and that fedex ground is not an employer of the driver of the company independent contractor however adverse determination in these matter could among other thing entitle certain of our owner operator and their driver to the reimbursement of certain expense and to the benefit of wage and hour law and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for fedex ground and could result in change to the independent contractor status of fedex ground owner operator change to state law governing the definition of independent contractor could also impact the status of fedex ground owner operator we may not be able to achieve our profit improvement goal by the end of in we announced profit improvement program primarily through initiative at fedex express and fedex service that include cost reduction modernization of our aircraft fleet transformation of the domestic operation and international profit improvement at fedex express and improved efficiency and lower cost of information technology at fedex service to this end we retired from service aircraft and related table of content engine and we shortened the depreciable life of an additional aircraft and related engine in an effort to modernize our aircraft fleet and improve our global network additionally during we completed voluntary buyout program offering cash buyout to eligible based employee we will continue to work towards our goal of annual profitability improvement at fedex express of billion by the end of our ability to achieve this objective is dependent on number of factor including the health of the global economy and future customer demand particularly for our priority service in light of these factor we may not be able to achieve our goal the transportation infrastructure continues to be target of terrorist activity because transportation asset continue to be target of terrorist activity government around the world are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirement that will increase operating cost and potentially slow service for business including those in the transportation industry for example the transportation security administration continues to require fedex express to comply with full all cargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains evolving and strict security requirement these requirement are not static but change periodically the result of regulatory and legislative requirement imposing additional security cost and creating level of uncertainty for our operation thus it is reasonably possible that these rule or other future security requirement could impose material cost on moreover terrorist attack directed at fedex or other aspect of the transportation infrastructure could disrupt our operation and adversely impact demand for our service the regulatory environment for global aviation or other transportation right may impact our operation our extensive air network is critical to our success our right to serve foreign point is subject to the approval of the department of transportation and generally requires bilateral agreement between the united state and foreign government in addition we must obtain the permission of foreign government to provide specific flight and service our operation outside of the united state such fedex express growing international domestic operation are also subject to current and potential regulation including certain postal regulation and licensing requirement that restrict make difficult and sometimes prohibit the ability of foreign owned company such fedex express to compete effectively in part of the international domestic transportation and logistics market regulatory action affecting global aviation or transportation right or failure to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation right in important international market could impair our ability to operate our network we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market response to such change concern over climate change including the impact of global warming ha led to significant and international legislative and regulatory effort to limit greenhouse gas ghg emission including our aircraft and diesel engine emission for example during the european commission approved the extension of the european union emission trading scheme ets for ghg emission to the airline industry under this decision all fedex express flight that are wholly within the european union are now covered by the ets requirement and each year we are required to submit emission allowance in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emission from such flight in addition the congress ha in the past considered bill that would regulate ghg emission and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future increased regulation regarding ghg emission especially aircraft or diesel engine emission could impose substantial cost on especially at fedex express these cost include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital cost associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicle prematurely until the timing scope and extent of such regulation becomes known we can not predict it effect on our cost structure or our operating result it is reasonably possible however that it could impose material cost on moreover even without such regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by company in the airline and transportation industry could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our service especially our air express service finally given the broad and global scope of our operation and our susceptibility to global macro economic trend we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risk of climate change that could affect all of humankind such shift in weather pattern and world ecosystem table of content localized disaster in key geography could adversely impact our business while we operate several integrated network with asset distributed throughout the world there are concentration of key asset within our network that are exposed to localized risk from natural or manmade disaster such tornado flood earthquake or terrorist attack the loss of key location such our memphis super hub or one of our information technology center could cause significant disruption to our operation and cause to incur significant cost to reestablish or relocate these function moreover resulting economic dislocation including supply chain and fuel disruption could adversely impact demand for our service our business may be adversely impacted by disruption or modification in service by the usps the usps is significant customer and vendor of fedex and thus disruption or modification in service by the usps consequence of the usps current financial difficulty or any resulting structural change to it operation network service offering or pricing could have an adverse effect on our operation and financial result we are also subject to other risk and uncertainty that affect many other business including increasing cost the volatility of cost and funding requirement and other legal mandate for employee benefit especially pension and healthcare benefit the increasing cost of compliance with federal state and foreign governmental agency mandate including the foreign corrupt practice act and the bribery act and defending against inappropriate or unjustified enforcement or other action by such agency the impact of any international conflict on the united state and global economy in general the transportation industry or in particular and effect these event will have on our cost or the demand for our service any impact on our business resulting from new domestic or international government law and regulation change in foreign currency exchange rate especially in the chinese yuan euro brazilian real british pound and the canadian dollar which can affect our sale level and foreign currency sale price market acceptance of our new service and growth initiative any liability resulting from and the cost of defending against class action litigation such wage and hour and discrimination and retaliation claim and any other legal or governmental proceeding the outcome of future negotiation to reach new collective bargaining agreement including with the union that represents the pilot of fedex express the current pilot contract became amendable in march and the party are currently in negotiation the impact of technology development on our operation and on demand for our service and our ability to continue to identify and eliminate unnecessary information technology redundancy and complexity throughout the organization governmental underinvestment in transportation infrastructure which could increase our cost and adversely impact our service level due to traffic congestion or sub optimal routing of our vehicle and aircraft widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease or any other public health crisis and availability of financing on term acceptable to and our ability to maintain our current credit rating especially given the capital intensity of our

we do not expect that the resolution of any of our uncertain tax position will have material effect on table of content fedex corporation note to consolidated financial statement continued note retirement plan we sponsor program that provide retirement benefit to most of our employee these program include defined benefit pension plan defined contribution plan and postretirement healthcare plan the accounting for pension and postretirement healthcare plan includes numerous assumption such discount rate expected long term investment return on plan asset future salary increase employee turnover mortality and retirement age these assumption most significantly impact our pension plan the accounting guidance related to postretirement benefit requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan and the recognition in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci of unrecognized gain or loss and prior service cost or credit the funded status is measured the difference between the fair value of the plan asset and the projected benefit obligation pbo of the plan we recorded decrease to equity of million net

million domestic and international pension plan domestic and international defined contribution plan domestic and international postretirement healthcare plan total retirement plan cost in were lower than due to the favorable impact of higher discount rate at our may measurement date and higher return on plan asset pension plan our largest pension plan cover certain employee age and over with at least one year of service pension benefit for most employee are accrued under cash balance formula we call the portable pension account under the portable pension account the retirement benefit is expressed dollar amount in notional account that grows with annual credit based on pay age and year of credited service and interest on the notional account balance the portable pension account benefit is payable lump sum or an annuity at retirement at the election of the employee the plan interest credit rate varies from year to year based on treasury index and corporate bond rate prior to certain employee earned benefit using traditional pension formula based on average earnings and year of service benefit under this formula were capped on may for most employee we also sponsor or participate in nonqualified benefit plan covering certain of our employee group and other pension plan covering certain of our international employee the international defined benefit pension plan provide benefit primarily based on earnings and year of service and are funded in compliance with local law and practice postretirement healthcare plan certain of our subsidiary offer medical dental and vision coverage to eligible retiree and their eligible dependent employee covered by the principal plan become eligible for these benefit at age and older if they have permanent continuous service of at least year after attainment of age if hired prior to january or at least year after attainment of age if hired on or after january postretirement healthcare benefit are capped at of the per caput projected employer cost which ha been reached and therefore these benefit are not subject to additional future inflation pension plan assumption our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligation the level of plan asset available to fund those obligation and the expected long term rate of return on plan asset we use measurement date of may for our pension and postretirement healthcare plan management review the assumption used to measure pension cost on an annual basis economic and market condition at the measurement date impact these assumption from year to year actuarial gain or loss are generated for change in assumption and to the extent that actual result differ from those assumed these actuarial gain and loss are amortized over the remaining average service life of our active employee if they exceed corridor amount in the aggregate table of content fedex corporation note to consolidated financial statement continued weighted average actuarial assumption for our primary retirement plan which represent substantially all of our pbo and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo are follows pension plan postretirement healthcare plan discount rate used to determine benefit obligation discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost rate of increase in future compensation level used to determine benefit obligation rate of increase in future compensation level used to determine net periodic benefit cost expected long term rate of return on asset the estimated average rate of return on plan asset is the expected future long term rate of earnings on plan asset and is forward looking assumption that materially affect our pension cost establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension asset is judgmental matter we review the expected long term rate of return on an annual basis and revise it appropriate management considers the following factor in determining this assumption the duration of our pension plan liability which drive the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan asset the type of investment class in which we invest our pension plan asset and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment class to earn over time and the investment return we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the return we could expect if investment were made strictly in indexed fund our expected long term rate of return on plan asset wa in and in and our actual return in each of the past three year exceeded those amount for our principal domestic pension plan for we lowered our expected return on plan asset assumption for long term return on plan asset to we refined our asset and liability management strategy in lowering this assumption we considered our historical return our investment strategy for our plan asset including the impact of the duration of our plan liability and the relatively low annual draw on plan asset on that investment strategy for the year period ended may our actual annual return were pension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan asset at the measurement date we use calculated value method to determine the value of plan asset which help mitigate short term volatility in market performance both increase and decrease by amortizing certain actuarial gain or loss over period no longer than four year another method used in practice applies the market value of plan asset at the measurement date for purpose of valuing plan asset for determining pension expense the calculated value method resulted in the same value the market value it did in and the investment strategy for pension plan asset is to utilize diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolio together with fixed income portfolio to earn long term investment return that meet our pension plan obligation our pension plan asset are invested primarily in publicly tradeable security and our pension plan hold only minimal investment in fedex common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third party pension fund investment manager our largest holding class are corporate fixed income security and government fixed income security which are largely benchmarked against the barclays long government long corporate index and large cap equity which are mainly indexed to the index accordingly we do not have any significant concentration of risk active management strategy are utilized within the plan in an effort to realize investment return in excess of market index part of our strategy to manage pension cost and funded status volatility we have transitioned to liability driven investment strategy to better align plan asset with liability our investment strategy also includes the limited use of derivative financial instrument on discretionary basis to improve investment return and manage exposure to market risk in all case our investment manager are prohibited from using derivative for speculative purpose and are not permitted to use derivative to leverage portfolio

lawsuit allege among other thing that they were forced to work off the clock were not paid overtime or were not provided work break or other benefit the complaint generally seek unspecified monetary damage injunctive relief or both we do not believe that material loss is reasonably possible with respect to any of these matter independent contractor lawsuit and state administrative proceeding fedex ground is involved in numerous class action lawsuit including that have been certified class action individual lawsuit and state tax and other administrative proceeding that claim that the company owner operator should be treated employee rather than independent contractor most of the class action lawsuit were consolidated for administration of the pre trial proceeding by single federal court the district court for the northern district of indiana the multidistrict litigation court granted class certification in case and denied it in case on december the court entered an opinion and order addressing all outstanding motion for summary judgment on the status of the owner operator independent contractor employee in sum the court ha now ruled on our summary judgment motion and entered judgment in favor of fedex ground on all claim in of the multidistrict litigation case that had been certified class action finding that the owner operator in those case were contractor matter of the table of content fedex corporation note to consolidated financial statement continued law of state the plaintiff filed notice of appeal in all of these case the seventh circuit heard the appeal in the kansa case in january and in july issued an opinion that did not make determination with respect to the correctness of the district court decision and instead certified two question to the kansa supreme court related to the classification of the plaintiff independent contractor under the kansa wage payment act the kansa supreme court heard oral argument on november the other case that are before the seventh circuit remain stayed pending decision of the kansa supreme court the multidistrict litigation court remanded the other eight certified class action back to the district court where they were originally filed because it summary judgment ruling did not completely dispose of all of the claim in those lawsuit three of those case are now on appeal with the court of appeal for the ninth circuit and one is on appeal with the court of appeal for the eleventh circuit the other four remain pending in their respective district court but three of these four matter have been settled for immaterial amount the court have granted final approval of two of the three settlement while the other settlement remains subject to court approval while the granting of summary judgment in favor of fedex ground by the multidistrict litigation court in of the case that had been certified class action remains subject to appeal we believe that it significantly improves the likelihood that our independent contractor model will be upheld adverse determination in matter related to fedex ground independent contractor however could among other thing entitle certain of our owner operator and their driver to the reimbursement of certain expense and to the benefit of wage and hour law and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for fedex ground and could result in change to the independent contractor status of fedex ground owner operator in certain jurisdiction we believe that fedex ground owner operator are properly classified independent contractor and that fedex ground is not an employer of the driver of the company independent contractor while it is reasonably possible that potential loss in some of these lawsuit or such change to the independent contractor status of fedex ground owner operator could be material we can not yet determine the amount or reasonable range of potential loss number of factor contribute to this the number of plaintiff in these lawsuit continues to change with some being dismissed and others being added and to new plaintiff discovery is still ongoing in addition the party have conducted only limited discovery into damage which could vary considerably from plaintiff to plaintiff further the range of potential loss could be impacted considerably by future ruling on the merit of certain claim and fedex ground various defense and on evidentiary issue in any event we do not believe that material loss is probable in these matter in addition we are defending contractor model case that are not or are no longer part of the multidistrict litigation two of which have been certified class action these certified class action were settled for immaterial amount in the first quarter of and have received final court approval the other case are in varying stage of litigation and we do not expect to incur material loss in any of these matter city and state of new york cigarette suit on december

we are global provider of transportation commerce and business service the substantial majority of our transaction are denominated in dollar the principal foreign currency exchange rate risk to which we are exposed are in the chinese yuan euro brazilian real british pound and the canadian dollar historically our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation is more significant with respect to our revenue than our expense significant portion of our expense are denominated in dollar such aircraft and fuel expense during foreign currency fluctuation had slightly negative impact on operating income the impact of foreign currency fluctuation wa slightly positive in however favorable foreign currency fluctuation also may have had an offsetting impact on the price we obtained or the demand

sale level or local currency price commodity while we have market risk for change in the price of jet and vehicle fuel this risk is largely mitigated by our variable fuel surcharge because our fuel surcharge are closely linked to market price for fuel therefore hypothetical change in the price of fuel would not be expected to materially affect our earnings over the long term however our fuel surcharge for fedex express and fedex ground have timing lag of approximately six to eight week before they are adjusted for change in fuel price our fuel surcharge index also allows fuel price to fluctuate approximately for fedex express and approximately for fedex ground before an adjustment to the fuel surcharge occurs therefore our operating income may be affected should the spot price of
