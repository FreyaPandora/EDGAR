impossible to predict or identify all such factor and result you should not consider the following factor to be complete discussion of risk uncertainty and assumption macroeconomic risk our business and the industry we serve are highly sensitive to global and regional economic condition our result of operation are materially affected by economic condition globally and regionally and in the particular industry we serve the demand for our product and service tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in period of economic weakness characterized by lower level of government and business investment lower level of business confidence lower corporate earnings high real interest rate lower credit activity or tighter credit condition perceived or actual industry overcapacity higher unemployment and lower consumer spending prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in increased expense due to higher allowance for doubtful account and potential goodwill and asset impairment charge economic condition vary across region and country and demand for our product and service generally increase in those region and country experiencing economic growth and investment slower economic growth or change in the global mix of region and country experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition the energy transportation and mining industry are major user of our product including the coal iron ore gold copper oil and natural gas industry customer in these industry frequently base their decision to purchase our product and service on the expected future performance of these industry which in turn are dependent in part on commodity price price of commodity in these industry are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictably in response to general economic condition and trend government action regulatory action commodity inventory production and consumption level technological innovation commodity substitution market expectation and any disruption in production or distribution or change in consumption economic condition affecting the industry we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditure by our customer reduced capital expenditure by our customer are likely to lead to decrease in the demand for our product and service and may also result in decrease in demand for aftermarket part customer are likely to extend preventative maintenance schedule and delay major overhaul when possible the rate of infrastructure spending commercial construction and housing start also play significant role in our result our product are an integral component of these activity and these activity decrease demand for our product may be significantly impacted which could negatively impact our result commodity price change material price increase fluctuation in demand for our product significant disruption to our supply chain or significant shortage of material may adversely impact our financial result or our ability to meet commitment to customer we are significant user of steel and many other commodity required for the manufacture of our product increase in the price of such commodity would increase our cost negatively impacting our business result of operation and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased cost through price increase productivity improvement or cost reduction program we rely on supplier to produce or secure material required for the manufacture of our product production challenge at supplier disruption in delivery to or from supplier or decreased availability of raw material or commodity could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitment to customer or increase our operating cost the increase in demand in of ha led to challenge for certain product due to supplier constraint despite improvement in material flow part and component constraint remain across some product which could impact our sale in global supplier continue to increase production to meet demand on the other hand in circumstance where demand for our product is le than we expect we may experience excess inventory and be forced to incur additional cost and our profitability may suffer our business competitive position result of operation or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operation if we experience excess inventory or if we are unable to adjust our production schedule or our purchase from supplier to reflect change in customer demand and market fluctuation on timely basis change in government monetary or fiscal policy may negatively impact our result most country where our product and service are sold have established central bank to regulate monetary system and influence economic activity generally by adjusting interest rate interest rate change affect overall economic growth which affect demand for residential and nonresidential structure well energy and mined product which in turn affect sale of our product and service that serve these activity interest rate change may also affect our customer ability to finance machine purchase can change the optimal time to keep machine in fleet and can impact the ability of our supplier to finance the production of part and component necessary to manufacture and support our product increase in interest rate could negatively impact sale and create supply chain inefficiency central bank and other policy arm of many country may take action to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy the impact from change in liquidity and credit policy could negatively affect the customer and market we serve or our supplier which could adversely impact our business result of operation and financial condition change in monetary and fiscal policy along with other factor may cause currency exchange rate to fluctuate action that lead the currency exchange rate of country where we manufacture product to increase relative to other currency could reduce the competitiveness of product made in that country which could adversely affect our competitive position result of operation and financial condition government policy on tax and spending also affect our business throughout the world government spending finance significant portion of infrastructure development such highway airport sewer and water system and dam tax regulation determine asset depreciation life and impact the after tax return on business activity and investment both of which influence investment decision unfavorable development such decision to reduce public spending or increase tax could negatively impact our result our global operation are exposed to political and economic risk commercial instability and global event beyond our control in the country in which we operate our global operation are dependent upon product manufactured purchased and sold in the and internationally including in country with political and economic instability or uncertainty this includes for example the uncertainty related to the united kingdom withdrawal from the european union commonly known brexit some country have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruption than others our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuation in freight cost limitation on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruption in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic point of exit and entry for our product operating in different region and country expose to number of risk including multiple and potentially conflicting law regulation and policy that are subject to change imposition of currency restriction restriction on repatriation of earnings or other restraint imposition of new or additional tariff or quota withdrawal from or modification of trade agreement or the negotiation of new trade agreement imposition of new or additional trade and economic sanction law imposed by the or foreign government war or terrorist act and political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected country the occurrence of one or more of these event may negatively impact our business result of operation and financial condition of content operational risksthe success of our business depends on our ability to develop produce and market quality product that meet our customer need our business relies on continued global demand for our brand and product to achieve business goal we must develop and sell product that appeal to our dealer oems and end user customer this is dependent on number of factor including our ability to maintain key dealer relationship our ability to produce product that meet the quality performance and price expectation of our customer and our ability to develop effective sale advertising and marketing program in addition our continued success in selling product that appeal to our customer is dependent on leading edge innovation

to the marketplace to adequately protect our intellectual property right to supply product that meet applicable regulatory requirement including engine exhaust emission requirement or to predict market demand for or gain market acceptance of our product could have negative impact on our business result of operation and financial condition we operate in highly competitive environment which could adversely affect our sale and pricing we operate in highly competitive environment we compete on the basis of variety of factor including product performance customer service quality and price there can be no assurance that our product will be able to compete successfully with other company product thus our share of industry sale could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategy pursued by competitor unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulty our failure to price our product competitively our failure to produce our product at competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitor new machine or dealer owned rental fleet which could lead to downward pressure on machine rental rate and or used equipment price lack of customer acceptance of price increase we announce from time to time change in customer requirement for price discount change in our customer behavior or weak pricing environment could have an adverse impact on our business result of

make tax payment related to these obligation within the next year that would significantly impact liquidity off balance sheet arrangementswe are party to certain off balance sheet arrangement primarily in the form of guarantee information related to guarantee appears in note guarantee and product warranty of part ii item financial statement and supplementary data of contentscritical accounting policy the preparation of financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect reported amount the more significant estimate include residual value for leased asset fair value for goodwill impairment test warranty liability stock based compensation reserve for product liability and insurance loss postretirement benefit post sale discount credit loss and income tax we have incorporated many year of data into the determination of each of these estimate and we have not historically experienced significant adjustment these assumption are reviewed at least annually with the audit committee of the board of director following are the method and assumption used in determining our estimate and an indication of the risk inherent in each residual value for leased asset the residual value for cat financial leased asset which are an estimate of the market value of leased equipment at the end of the lease term are based on an analysis of historical wholesale market sale price projected forward on level trend line without consideration for inflation or possible future pricing action at the inception of the lease residual value are estimated with consideration of the following critical factor market size and demand any known significant market product trend total expected hour of usage machine configuration application location model change quantity past remarketing experience third party residual guarantee and contractual customer purchase option many of these factor are gathered in an application survey that is completed prior to quotation the lease agreement also clearly defines applicable return condition and remedy for non compliance to ensure that the leased equipment will be in good operating condition upon return model change and update well market strength and product acceptance are monitored and adjustment are made to residual value in accordance with the significance of any such change remarketing sale staff work closely with customer and dealer to manage the sale of lease return and the recovery of residual exposure during the term of the equipment on operating lease we evaluate our depreciation on regular basis taking into consideration expected residual value at lease termination adjustment to depreciation expense reflecting revised estimate of expected residual value at the end of the lease term are recorded prospectively on straight line basis for finance lease residual value adjustment are recognized through reduction of finance revenue we evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating lease for potential impairment when we determine triggering event ha occurred when triggering event occurs test for recoverability is performed by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flow to the carrying value of the equipment on operating lease if the test for recoverability identifies possible impairment the fair value of the equipment on operating lease is measured in accordance with the fair value measurement framework an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment on operating lease exceeds it estimated fair value at december the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating lease wa billion without consideration of other factor such third party residual guarantee or contractual customer purchase option non temporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating lease would reduce residual value estimate and result in the recognition of approximately million of additional annual depreciation expense fair value for goodwill impairment test we test goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level and whenever event or circumstance make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred such significant adverse change in the business climate or decision to sell all or portion of reporting unit we perform our annual goodwill impairment test of october and monitor for interim triggering event on an ongoing basis goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either qualitative assessment or quantitative goodwill impairment test if we choose to perform qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is necessary for reporting unit where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flow to the respective carrying value which includes goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds it carrying value the goodwill is not considered impaired beginning in if the carrying value is higher than the fair value the difference would be recognized an impairment loss prior to two step process wa used for reporting unit where we performed the two step process the first step required to compare the fair value of each reporting unit which we primarily determined using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flow to the respective carrying value which includes goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded it carrying value the goodwill wa not considered impaired if the carrying value wa higher than the fair value there wa an indication that an impairment may have existed and the second step wa required in step two the implied fair value of goodwill wa calculated the excess of the fair value of reporting unit over the fair value assigned to it asset and liability if the implied fair value of goodwill wa le than the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill the difference wa recognized an impairment loss of contentsthe impairment test process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit which we primarily determine using an income approach based on discounted five year forecasted cash flow with year five residual value the residual value is computed using the constant growth method which value the forecasted cash flow in perpetuity the income approach is supported by reconciliation of our calculated fair value for caterpillar to the company market capitalization the assumption about future cash flow and growth rate are based on each reporting unit long term forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management reporting unit discount rate is risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital which we believe approximates the rate from market participant perspective the estimated fair value could be impacted by change in market condition interest rate growth rate tax rate cost pricing and capital expenditure the fair value determination is categorized level in the fair value hierarchy due to it use of internal projection and unobservable measurement input our annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of indicated the fair value of each reporting unit wa substantially above it respective carrying value including goodwill caterpillar market capitalization ha remained significantly above the net book value of the company an unfavorable change in our expectation for the financial performance of our reporting unit particularly long term growth and profitability would reduce the fair value of our reporting unit the demand for our equipment and related part is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity price although the impact may vary by reporting unit the energy and mining industry are major user of our product including the coal iron ore gold copper oil and natural gas industry decision to purchase our product are dependent upon the performance of those industry which in turn are dependent in part on commodity price lower commodity price or industry specific circumstance that have negative impact to the valuation assumption may reduce the fair value of our reporting unit should such event occur and it becomes more likely than not that reporting unit fair value ha fallen below it carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment test may result in goodwill impairment depending on the outcome of the quantitative impairment test goodwill impairment would be reported non cash charge to earnings warranty liability at the time sale is recognized we record estimated future warranty cost the warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory generally historical claim rate are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model engine size by customer or dealer location inside or outside north america specific rate are developed for each product shipment month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience warranty cost may differ from those estimated if actual claim rate are higher or lower than our historical rate stock based compensation we use lattice based option pricing model to calculate the fair value of our stock option and stock appreciation right sars the calculation of the fair value of the award using the lattice based option pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant well assumption regarding the following volatility is measure of the amount by which the stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected term of the award and is based on historical caterpillar stock price movement and current implied volatility from traded option on caterpillar stock the implied volatility from traded option are impacted by change in market condition an increase in the volatility would result in an increase in our expense the expected term represents the period of time that award granted are expected to be outstanding and is an output of the lattice based option pricing model in determining the expected term of the award future exercise and forfeiture pattern are estimated from caterpillar employee historical exercise behavior these pattern are also affected by the vesting condition of the award change in the future exercise behavior of employee or in the vesting period of the award could result in change in the expected term an increase in the expected term would result in an increase to our expense the weighted average dividend yield is based on caterpillar historical dividend yield holder of stock option and sars do not receive dividend payment this could result in employee retaining the award for longer period of time if dividend yield decrease or exercising the award sooner if dividend yield increase decrease in the dividend yield would result in an increase in our expense the risk free interest rate is based on the treasury yield curve in effect at time of grant the risk free interest rate increase the expected term increase resulting in an increase in our expense beginning in the fair value of restricted stock unit rsus and performance based restricted stock unit prsus is determined the closing stock price on the date of grant holder of these award are credited with dividend equivalent unit on each date that cash dividend is paid to holder of common stock prior to rsus and prsus were not credited dividend equivalent unit and the fair value wa determined by reducing the stock price on the date of grant by the present value of the estimated dividend to be paid during the vesting period the estimated dividend were based on caterpillar quarterly dividend per share at the time of grant of content stock based compensation expense is recognized based on the grant date fair value forfeiture are accounted for in the period they occur reduction to expense stock based compensation expense for prsus is based on the probable number of share expected to vest change in the expected probability of achieving performance target in future period may result in an increase or decrease in our expense product liability and insurance loss reserve we determine these reserve based upon reported claim in process of settlement and actuarial estimate for loss incurred but not reported loss reserve including incurred but not reported reserve are based on estimate and ultimate settlement may vary significantly from such estimate due to increased claim frequency or severity over historical level postretirement benefit primary actuarial assumption were determined follows the assumed discount rate is used to discount future benefit obligation back to today dollar the discount rate is based on benefit cash flow matching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligation could effectively be settled of our measurement date december the benefit cash flow matching approach involves analyzing caterpillar projected cash flow against high quality bond yield curve calculated using wide population of corporate aa bond available on the measurement date similar approach is used to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant non plan in estimating the service and interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost we utilize full yield curve approach in determining discount rate this approach applies the specific spot rate along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flow discount rate are sensitive to change in interest rate decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation and future expense the expected long term rate of return on plan asset is based on our estimate of long term passive return for equity and fixed income security weighted by the allocation of our plan asset based on historical performance we increase the passive return due to our active management of the plan asset this rate is impacted by change in general market condition but because it represents long term rate it is not significantly impacted by short term market swing change in our allocation of plan asset would also impact this rate for example shift to more fixed income security would lower the rate decrease in the rate would increase our expense the expected return on plan asset is calculated using the fair value of plan asset of our measurement date december the expected rate of compensation increase is used to develop benefit obligation using projected pay at retirement it represents average long term salary increase this rate is influenced by our long term compensation policy an increase in the rate would increase our obligation and expense the assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care cost are assumed to increase and is based on historical and expected experience change in our projection of future health care cost due to general economic condition and those specific to health care technology driven cost change will impact this trend rate an increase in the trend rate would increase our obligation and expense the effect of actual result differing from our assumption and the effect of changing assumption are considered actuarial gain or loss we recognize actuarial gain or loss immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis triggering event warrant remeasurement see note for further information regarding the accounting for postretirement benefit post sale discount reserve we provide discount to dealer through merchandising program we have numerous program that are designed to promote the sale of our product the most common dealer program provide discount when the dealer sell product to targeted end user the amount of accrued post sale discount wa million and million of december and respectively the reserve represents discount that we expect to pay on previously sold unit and is reviewed at least quarterly the reserve is adjusted if discount paid differ from those estimated historically those adjustment have not been material credit loss reserve the allowance for credit loss is an estimate of the loss inherent in our finance receivable portfolio and includes consideration of account that have been individually identified impaired well pool of finance receivables where it is probable that certain receivables in the pool are impaired but the individual account can not yet be identified in identifying and measuring impairment management take into consideration past loss experience known and inherent risk in the portfolio of contentsadverse situation that may affect the borrower ability to repay estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic condition account are identified for individual review based on past due status and information available about the customer such financial statement news report and published credit rating well general information regarding industry trend and the economic environment in which our customer operate the allowance for credit loss attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired is based on the present value of expected future cash flow discounted at the receivables effective interest rate the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent receivables or the observable market price of the receivable in determining collateral value we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral le selling cost we also consider credit enhancement such additional collateral and contractual third party guarantee the allowance for credit loss attributable to the remaining account not yet individually identified impaired is estimated based on loss forecast model utilizing probability of default our estimate of the loss emergence period and the estimated loss given default in addition qualitative factor not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast model including industry trend macroeconomic factor and model imprecision are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit loss these qualitative factor are subjective and require degree of management judgment while management belief it ha exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumption there can be no assurance that in the future change in economic condition or other factor would not cause change in the financial health of our customer if the financial health of our customer deteriorates the timing and level of payment received could be impacted and therefore could result in change to our estimated loss income tax we are subject to the income tax law of the many jurisdiction in which we operate these tax law are complex and the manner in which they apply to our fact is sometimes open to interpretation in establishing the provision for income tax we must make judgment about the application of these inherently complex tax law our income tax position and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law future change in tax law or related interpretation could significantly impact the provision for income tax the amount of tax payable and the deferred tax asset and liability balance change in tax law are reflected in the period of enactment with related interpretation considered in the period received on january the treasury issued final regulation providing additional guidance related to the calculation of the mandatory deemed repatriation of non earnings we are currently evaluating the impact of these regulation and will recognize any resulting adjustment in the first quarter of despite our belief that our tax return position are consistent with applicable tax law we believe that taxing authority could challenge certain position settlement of any challenge can result in no change complete disallowance or some partial adjustment reached through negotiation or litigation we record tax benefit for uncertain tax position based upon management evaluation of the information available at the reporting date to be recognized in the financial statement tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merit the benefit for position meeting the recognition threshold is measured the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with taxing authority that ha full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required in making these determination and adjustment to unrecognized tax benefit may be necessary to reflect actual tax payable upon settlement adjustment related to position impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income tax adjustment related to position impacting the timing of deduction impact deferred tax asset and liability for tax year to including the impact of loss carryback to the irs ha proposed to tax in the united state profit earned from certain part transaction by caterpillar sarl csarl based on the irs examination team application of substance over form or assignment of income judicial doctrine csarl is primarily taxable locally in switzerland we are vigorously contesting the proposed increase to tax and penalty for these year of approximately billion we believe that the relevant transaction complied with applicable tax law and did not violate judicial doctrine the purchase of part by csarl from unrelated party and the subsequent sale of those part to unrelated dealer outside the united state have substantial legal commercial and economic consequence for the party involved therefore we have concluded that the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained related to this position is the entire benefit result no amount related to these irs adjustment is reflected in unrecognized tax benefit we have filed income tax return on this same basis for year after we currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position liquidity or result of operation deferred tax asset generally represent tax benefit for tax deduction or credit available in future tax return certain estimate and assumption are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of deferred tax asset will not be realized in making this assessment management analyzes the trend of gaap earnings and estimate the impact of future taxable income reversing temporary difference and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategy we give le weight in this analysis to mark to market adjustment to remeasure our pension and opeb plan we do not consider these adjustment indicative of ongoing earnings trend should change in fact or circumstance lead to change in judgment of contentsabout the ultimate realizability of

income tax other matter environmental and legal matter the company is regulated by federal state and international environmental law governing our use transport and disposal of substance and control of emission in addition to governing our manufacturing and other operation these law often impact the development of our product including but not limited to required compliance with air emission standard applicable to internal combustion engine we have made and will continue to make significant research and development and capital expenditure to comply with these emission standard we are engaged in remedial activity at number of location often with other company pursuant to federal and state law when it is probable we will pay remedial cost at site and those cost can be reasonably estimated the investigation remediation and operating and maintenance cost are accrued against our earnings cost are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site including available technology current applicable law and regulation and prior remediation experience where no amount within range of estimate is more likely we accrue the minimum where multiple potentially responsible party are involved we consider our proportionate share of the probable cost in formulating the estimate of probable cost we do not consider amount expected to be recovered from insurance company or others we reassess these accrued amount on quarterly basis the amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in accrued expense we believe there is no more than remote chance that material amount for remedial activity at any individual site or at all the site in the aggregate will be required on january the

financial position or liquidity in addition we are involved in other unresolved legal action that arise in the normal course of business the most prevalent of these unresolved action involve dispute related to product design manufacture and performance liability including claimed asbestos and welding fume exposure contract employment issue environmental matter intellectual property right tax other than income tax and security law the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss in excess of accrued liability if any associated with these unresolved legal action is not material in some case we can not reasonably estimate range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter however we believe there is no more than remote chance that any liability arising from these matter would be material although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal action we believe that these action will not individually or in the aggregate have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation financial position or liquidity of content retirement benefitswe recognize mark to market gain and loss immediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and opeb plan mark to market gain and loss represent the effect of actual result differing from our assumption and the effect of changing assumption change in discount rate and difference between the actual return on plan asset and the expected return on plan asset generally have the largest impact on mark to market gain and loss we recognized expense of million million and million in and respectively related to our defined benefit pension and opeb plan the increase in expense in compared to wa primarily due to higher net mark to market loss in compared to this wa partially offset by higher expected return on plan asset and curtailment gain compared to curtailment and termination charge in the decrease in expense in compared to wa primarily due to lower net mark to market loss in compared to this wa partially offset by an unfavorable change in amortization of prior service credit curtailment and termination charge and lower expected return on plan asset the primary factor that resulted in mark to market loss for and are described below the net mark to market loss were included in other income expense in the result of operation net mark to market loss of million primarily due to the difference between the actual return on plan asset compared to the expected return on plan asset pension plan had an actual rate of return of negative percent compared to an expected rate of return of percent this wa partially offset by higher discount rate at the end of compared to the end of net mark to market loss of million primarily due to lower discount rate at the end of compared to the end of and change in our mortality assumption discussed below this wa partially offset by the difference between the actual return on plan asset compared to the expected return on plan asset pension plan had an actual rate of return of percent compared to an expected rate of return of percent net mark to market loss of million primarily due to lower discount rate at the end of compared to the end of and change in our mortality assumption discussed below this wa partially offset by the difference between the actual return on plan asset compared to the expected return on plan asset pension plan had an actual rate of return of percent compared to an expected rate of return of percent in the fourth quarter of the company reviewed and made change to the mortality assumption primarily for our pension plan which resulted in an overall increase in the life expectancy of plan participant of december these change resulted in an increase in our liability for postemployment benefit of approximately million in the fourth quarter of the company adopted new mortality improvement scale released by the society of actuary for our pension and opeb plan of december this resulted in an increase in our liability for postemployment benefit of approximately million in the first quarter of we announced the closure of our gosselies belgium facility this announcement impacted certain employee that participated in defined benefit pension plan and resulted in net loss of million in the first quarter of for curtailment and termination benefit we expect our total defined benefit pension and opeb expense excluding the impact of mark to market gain and loss to increase approximately million in this increase is primarily due to lower expected return on plan asset pension plan have an expected rate of return of percent in compared to percent in in general our strategy for both the and the non pension includes ongoing alignment of our investment to our liability while reducing risk in our portfolio for our pension plan our year end asset allocation wa percent fixed income percent equity and percent other our current pension target asset allocation is percent fixed income and percent equity the target allocation is revisited periodically to ensure it reflects our overall objective the plan are rebalanced to within the appropriate target asset allocation range on monthly basis the year end asset allocation for our non pension plan wa percent fixed income percent equity percent real estate and percent other the weighted average target allocation for our non pension plan wa also percent fixed income percent equity percent real estate and percent other the target allocation for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirement demographic of the plan participant and funded status the frequency of rebalancing for the non plan varies depending on the plan of contentscontributions to our pension and opeb plan were billion and billion in and respectively both year included billion discretionary contribution to our pension plan we expect to make approximately million of contribution to our pension and opeb plan in we believe we have adequate resource to fund both pension and opeb plan effective january we adopted new accounting guidance issued by the fasb related to the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost the change in presentation wa applied retrospectively to prior year for further information see note operation and summary of significant accounting policy new accounting guidance of part ii item financial statement and supplementary data actuarial assumption have significant impact on both pension and opeb expense the

health care trend rate assumed for next year rate that the cost trend rate gradually decline to year that the cost trend rate reach ultimate rate sensitivity foreign exchange rate sensitivity machinery energy transportation operation use foreign currency forward and option contract to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movement that would reduce the dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to of contentsfive year based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our machinery energy transportation operation for the next month and the foreign currency derivative instrument in place at year end hypothetical percent weakening of the dollar relative to all other currency would adversely affect our expected cash flow for our machinery energy transportation operation by approximately million last year similar assumption and calculation yielded potential million adverse impact on cash flow we determine our net exposure by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instrument we multiply these net amount by percent to determine the sensitivity since our policy for financial product operation is to hedge the foreign exchange risk when the currency of our debt portfolio doe not match the currency of our receivable portfolio percent change in the value of the dollar relative to all other currency would not have material effect on our consolidated financial position result of operation or cash flow neither our policy the effect of percent change in the value of the dollar ha changed from that reported at the end of last year the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rate ignores the effect this movement may have on other variable including competitive risk if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact the result would probably be different from the sensitivity effect shown above in addition it is unlikely that all currency would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the dollar in reality some currency may weaken while others may strengthen our primary exposure excluding competitive risk is to exchange rate movement in the japanese yen british pound indian rupee swiss franc and australian dollar interest rate sensitivity for our machinery energy transportation operation we have the option to use interest rate contract to lower the cost of borrowed fund by attaching fixed to floating interest rate contract to fixed rate debt and by entering into forward rate agreement on future debt issuance hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rate along the entire interest rate yield curve would have minimal impact to the pre tax earnings of machinery energy transportation last year similar assumption and calculation yielded minimal impact to pre tax earnings for our financial product operation we use interest rate derivative instrument primarily to meet our match funding objective and strategy we have match funding policy whereby the interest rate profile fixed or floating rate of our debt portfolio is matched to the interest rate profile of our earning asset portfolio finance receivables and operating lease within certain parameter in connection with that policy we use interest rate derivative instrument to modify the debt structure match funding assist in maintaining our interest rate spread regardless of the direction interest rate move in order to properly manage sensitivity to change in interest rate financial product measure the potential impact of different interest rate assumption on pre tax earnings all on balance sheet position including derivative financial instrument are included in the analysis the primary assumption included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate asset or liability the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate asset remains unchanged and the level of floating rate asset and debt remain constant an analysis of the december balance sheet using these assumption estimate the impact of basis point immediate and sustained adverse change in interest rate to have minimal impact on pre tax earnings last year similar assumption and calculation yielded minimal impact to pre tax earnings this analysis doe not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement nor doe it consider any action management could undertake in response to change in interest rate accordingly no assurance can be given that actual result would be consistent with the result of our estimate non gaap financial measuresthe following definition are provided for the non gaap financial measure used in this report these non gaap financial measure have no standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measure for other company management doe not intend these item to be considered in isolation or substitute for the related gaap measure we believe it is important to separately

inventory are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is principally determined using the last in first out lifo method the value of inventory on the lifo basis represented about percent of total inventory at december and if the fifo first in first out method had been in use inventory would have been million and million higher than reported at december and respectively depreciation and amortization depreciation of plant and equipment is computed principally using accelerated method depreciation on equipment leased to others primarily for financial product is computed using the straight line method over the term of the lease the depreciable basis is the original cost of the equipment le the estimated residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease term in and cat financial depreciation on equipment leased to others wa million million and million respectively and wa included in other operating income expense in statement in and consolidated depreciation expense wa million million and million respectively amortization of purchased finite lived intangible is computed principally using the straight line method generally not to exceed period of year foreign currency translation the functional currency for most of our machinery energy transportation consolidated company is the dollar the functional currency for most of our financial product and affiliate accounted for under the equity method is the respective local currency gain and loss resulting from the remeasurement of foreign currency amount to the functional currency are included in other income expense in statement gain and loss resulting from translating asset and liability from the functional currency to dollar are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in statement derivative financial instrument our earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuation due to change in foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and commodity price our risk management policy policy allows for the use of derivative financial instrument to prudently manage foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and commodity price exposure our policy specifies that derivative are not to be used for speculative purpose derivative that we use are primarily foreign currency forward option and cross currency contract interest rate contract and commodity forward and option contract all derivative are recorded at fair value see note for more information income tax the provision for income tax is determined using the asset and liability approach taking into account guidance related to uncertain tax position tax law require item to be included in tax filing at different time than the item are reflected in the financial statement current liability is recognized for the estimated tax payable for the current year deferred tax represent the future tax consequence expected to occur when the reported amount of asset and liability are recovered or paid deferred tax are adjusted for enacted change in tax rate and tax law valuation allowance are recorded to reduce deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that tax benefit will not be realized goodwill for acquisition accounted for business combination goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net asset acquired we are required to test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and when event or circumstance make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to component to which goodwill is assigned when initially recorded we assign goodwill to reporting unit based on our integration plan and the expected synergy resulting from the acquisition because caterpillar is highly integrated company the business we acquire are sometimes combined with or integrated into existing reporting unit when change occur in the composition of our operating segment or reporting unit goodwill is reassigned to the affected reporting unit based on their relative fair value we perform our annual goodwill impairment test of october and monitor for interim triggering event on an ongoing basis goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either qualitative assessment or quantitative goodwill impairment test if we choose to perform qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is necessary for reporting unit where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flow to the respective carrying value which includes goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds it carrying value the goodwill is not considered impaired beginning in if the carrying value is higher than the fair value the

reporting unit which we primarily determined using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flow to the respective carrying value which includes goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded it carrying value the goodwill wa not considered impaired if the carrying value wa higher than the fair value there wa an indication that an impairment may have existed and the second step wa required in step two the implied fair value of goodwill wa calculated the excess of the fair value of reporting unit over the fair value assigned to it asset and liability if the

information of fair value disclosure fair value measurement the guidance on fair value measurement defines fair value the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participant this guidance also specifies fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of input used in valuation technique observable input highest level reflect market data obtained from independent source while unobservable input lowest level reflect internally developed market assumption in accordance with this guidance fair value measurement are classified under the following hierarchy level quoted price for identical instrument in active market level quoted price for similar instrument in active market quoted price for identical or similar instrument in market that are not active and model derived valuation in which all significant input or significant value driver are observable in active market level model derived valuation in which one or more significant input or significant value driver are unobservable when available we use quoted market price to determine fair value and we classify such measurement within level in some case where market price are not available we make use of observable market based input to calculate fair value in which case the measurement are classified within level if quoted or observable market price are not available fair value is based upon valuation in which one or more significant input are unobservable including internally developed model that use where possible current market based parameter such interest rate yield curve and currency rate these measurement are classified within level fair value measurement are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation measurement may therefore be classified within level even though there may be significant input that are readily observable fair value measurement includes the consideration of nonperformance risk nonperformance risk refers to the risk that an obligation either by counterparty or caterpillar will not be fulfilled for financial asset traded in an active market level and certain level the nonperformance risk is included in the market price for certain other
