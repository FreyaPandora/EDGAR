require significant or complex judgment and estimate on the part of management the company critical accounting policy are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of director dollar in million except per share amount in certain instance accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting method the company significant policy that involve the selection of alternative method are accounting for shipping and handling cost for the year ended december and and inventory the company account for shipping and

bps and bps in and respectively with no impact on reported earnings the company account for inventory using both the first in first out fifo method of inventory and the lifo method of inventory there would have been no material impact on reported earnings for or had all inventory been accounted for under the fifo method the area of accounting that involve significant or complex judgment and estimate are pension and other retiree benefit cost assumption stock based compensation asset impairment uncertain tax position tax valuation allowance legal and other contingency reserve in pension accounting the most significant actuarial assumption are the discount rate and the long term rate of return on plan asset the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for defined benefit plan wa and of december and respectively the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other postretirement plan wa and of december and respectively discount rate used for the and international defined benefit and other postretirement plan are based on yield curve constructed from portfolio of high quality bond whose projected cash flow approximate the projected benefit payment of the plan the assumed long term rate of return on plan asset for plan wa of december and and of december in determining the long term rate of return the company considers the nature of the plan investment and the historical rate of return average annual rate of return for the plan for the most recent year year year year and year period were and respectively in addition the current assumed rate of return for the plan is based upon the nature of the plan investment with target asset allocation of approximately in fixed income security in equity security and in real estate and other investment change in the assumed rate of return on plan asset of the pension plan would impact future net income attributable to colgate palmolive company by approximately change in the discount rate for the pension plan would impact future net income attributable to colgate palmolive company by approximately third assumption is the long term rate of compensation increase change in which would partially offset the impact of change in either the discount rate or the long term rate of return this rate wa of december and refer to note retirement plan and other retiree benefit to the consolidated financial statement for further discussion of the company pension and other postretirement plan the assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefit is the medical cost trend rate the company review external data and it own historical trend for health care cost to determine the medical cost trend rate the assumed rate of increase for the postretirement benefit plan is for declining to by and remaining at for the year thereafter the effect on the total of service and interest cost component of increase in the assumed long term medical cost trend rate would decrease net income attributable to colgate palmolive company by dollar in million except per share amount the company recognizes the cost of employee service received in exchange for award of equity instrument such stock option and restricted stock unit based on the fair value of those award at the date of grant the company us the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option award the weighted average estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended december wa the black scholes model us various assumption to estimate the fair value of stock option award these assumption include the expected term of stock option award expected volatility rate risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield while these assumption do not require significant judgment the significant input are determined from historical experience or independent third party source change in these input could result in significant change in the fair value of stock option award one year change in expected term would result in change in fair value of approximately change in volatility would change fair value by approximately goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset such the company global brand are subject to impairment test at least annually the company performs either quantitative or qualitative assessment to determine the fair value of it reporting unit for goodwill and fair value of it indefinite life intangible asset the asset impairment analysis is generally performed using an income method which requires several estimate including future cash flow consistent with management strategic plan sale growth rate foreign exchange rate and the selection of discount rate for the company goodwill impairment analysis fair value is also determined using the market approach which is generally derived from metric of comparable publicly traded company when multiple valuation methodology are used in reporting unit goodwill impairment analysis the company performs qualitative analysis comparing the fair value of reporting unit under each method to ass it reasonableness and ensure consistency of result other qualitative factor the company considers in addition to those quantitative measure discussed above include assessment of general macroeconomic condition industry specific consideration and historical financial performance the estimated fair value of the company intangible asset substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value except for the intangible asset acquired in the sanex acquisition in and the pca skin and elta md acquisition in which were recorded at fair value the estimated fair value of the company reporting unit also substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value therefore it is not reasonably likely that significant change in these estimate would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these asset the company applies the relief from royalty method to estimate the fair value of the intangible asset acquired in the sanex acquisition the sanex intangible asset under this method the fair value of an intangible asset is calculated the present value of future royalty saving generated result of owning the intangible asset the key assumption used in determining the company estimate of the fair value of the sanex intangible asset include royalty rate discount rate and long term revenue growth rate estimating long term revenue growth rate requires significant judgment by management in area such future economic condition product pricing and consumer taste and preference in determining an appropriate discount rate the company considers the current interest rate environment and it estimated cost of capital result of the analysis the company determined that the fair value of the sanex intangible asset exceeded their carrying value by more than and concluded that such excess wa reasonable considering the brand relatively recent acquisition based on this the brand recent performance and the company future plan for it the company doe not believe there is significant risk of impairment related to the sanex intangible asset given the recent acquisition of pca skin and elta md the performance of pca skin and elta md since acquisition and the company future plan for these brand the company doe not believe there is significant risk of impairment related to either pca skin and elta md intangible asset asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed asset in connection with the global growth

annual report on form for the year ended december the provisional charge wa comprised of related to the one time deemed repatriation of accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiary and related

previously provided for planned repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiary result applicable and foreign tax have been provided on substantially all of the company accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiary previously considered indefinitely reinvested during the company finalized it assessment of the impact of the tcja and recognized an additional tax expense of reflecting
