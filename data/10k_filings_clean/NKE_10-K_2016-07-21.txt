supplier in the country manufacturing take place nike independent contract manufacturer and supplier have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying raw material requirement for the production of our product of contentssince sojitz corporation of america sojitz america large japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock ha performed significant import export financing service for during fiscal sojitz america provided financing and purchasing service for nike brand product sold in certain nike market including argentina uruguay brazil canada india south africa and thailand excluding product produced and sold in the same country approximately of nike brand sale occurred in those country any failure of sojitz america to provide these service or any failure of sojitz america bank could disrupt our ability to acquire product from our supplier and to deliver product to our customer in those market such disruption could result in canceled order that would adversely affect sale and profitability however we believe that any such disruption would be short term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative source of financing at competitive rate our current agreement with sojitz america expire on may and contain provision allowing to extend the agreement to may international operation and tradeour international operation and source of supply are subject to the usual risk of business abroad such possible increase in import duty anti dumping measure quota safeguard measure trade restriction restriction on the transfer of fund and in certain part of the world political instability and terrorism we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk can not predict the likelihood of such material effect occurring in the future in recent year uncertain global and regional economic condition have affected international trade and caused rise in protectionist action around the world these trend are affecting many global manufacturing and service sector and the footwear and apparel industry whole are not immune company in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different region and in nearly all case we are working together with industry group to address trade issue and reduce the impact to the industry while observing applicable competition law notwithstanding our effort protectionist measure have resulted in increase in the cost of our product and additional measure if implemented could adversely affect sale and or profitability for nike well the imported footwear and apparel industry whole we monitor protectionist trend and development throughout the world that may materially impact our industry and we engage in administrative and judicial process to mitigate trade restriction we are actively monitoring action that may result in additional anti dumping measure and could affect our industry we are also monitoring for and advocating other impediment that may limit or delay custom clearance for import of footwear apparel and equipment moreover with respect to trade restriction targeting china which represents an important sourcing country and consumer market for we are working with broad coalition of global business and trade association representing wide variety of sector to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented address legitimate and core concern ii is consistent with international trade rule and iii reflects and considers china domestic economy and the important role ha in the global economic community where trade protection measure are implemented we believe that we have the ability to develop over period of time adequate alternative source of supply for the product obtained from our present supplier if event prevented from acquiring product from our supplier in particular country our operation could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe we could abate any such disruption and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of short term nature although alternate source of supply might not be cost effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability nike advocate for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in number of regional and bilateral free trade agreement the trans pacific partnership tpp if ultimately ratified ha the potential to reduce or eliminate high rate of custom duty for import into the united state of nike product sourced from tpp country primarily footwear and apparel from

endorsement pricing cost of production customer service and social medium presence are area of intense competition this in addition to rapid change in technology and consumer preference in the market for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factor in our operation if we not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitor our

comment about on social networking website could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image our product sale financial condition and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected of contentsif we are unable to anticipate consumer preference and develop new product we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenue and

our product may make it more difficult for to respond rapidly to new or changing product trend or consumer preference all of our product are subject to changing consumer preference that can not be predicted with certainty our new product may not receive consumer acceptance consumer preference could shift rapidly to different type of performance product or away from these type of product altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these change if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trend and shift in consumer preference by

produce product that help to enhance athletic performance reduce injury and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our product consumer demand for our product could decline and if we experience problem with the quality of our product we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problem failure to continue to obtain or maintain high quality endorser of our product could harm our business we establish relationship with professional athlete sport team and league to develop evaluate and promote our product well establish product authenticity with consumer however competition in our industry ha increased the cost associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorship and other relationship have increased if we are unable to maintain our current association with professional athlete sport team and league or to do at reasonable cost we could lose the on field authenticity associated with our product and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investment result our brand net revenue expense and profitability could be harmed furthermore if certain endorser were to stop using our product contrary to their endorsement agreement our business could be adversely affected in addition action taken by athlete team or league associated with our product that harm the reputation of those athlete team or league could also seriously harm our brand image with consumer and result could have an adverse effect on our sale and financial condition in addition poor performance by our endorser failure to continue to correctly identify promising athlete to use and endorse our product or failure to enter into cost effective endorsement arrangement with prominent athlete and sport organization could adversely affect our brand sale and profitability currency exchange rate fluctuation could result in lower revenue higher cost and decreased margin and earnings majority of our product are manufactured and sold outside of the united state result we conduct purchase and sale transaction in various currency which increase our exposure to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate globally additionally ha been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rate result of the united kingdom june referendum in which voter approved the united kingdom exit from the european union commonly referred to brexit our international revenue and expense generally are derived from sale and operation in foreign currency and these revenue and expense could be affected by currency fluctuation specifically amount recorded in foreign currency and translated into dollar for consolidated financial reporting weakening of foreign currency relative to the dollar adversely affect the dollar value of the company foreign currency denominated sale and earnings currency exchange rate fluctuation could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturer that produce our product by making their purchase of raw material more expensive and more difficult to finance foreign currency fluctuation have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our result of operation and financial condition we may hedge certain foreign currency exposure to lessen and delay but not to completely eliminate the effect of foreign currency fluctuation on our financial result since the hedging activity are designed to lessen volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of stronger dollar or other trading currency but they also reduce the positive impact of weaker dollar or other trading currency our future financial result could be significantly affected by the value of the dollar in relation to the foreign currency in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial result are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activity of contentsglobal economic condition could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition the uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact business around the world most acutely in emerging market and developing economy if global economic and financial market condition do not improve or deteriorate the following factor could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our product reduced order from retailer for our product order cancellation lower revenue higher discount increased inventory and lower gross margin in the future we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital market at reasonable rate in the event we find it desirable to do so we conduct transaction in various currency which increase our exposure to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate relative to the dollar continued volatility in the market and exchange rate for foreign currency and contract in foreign currency could have significant impact on our reported operating result and financial condition continued volatility in the availability and price for commodity and raw material we use in our product and in our supply chain such cotton or petroleum derivative could have material adverse effect on our cost gross margin and profitability if retailer of our product experience declining revenue or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit market to purchase our product this could result in reduced order for our product order cancellation late retailer payment extended payment term higher account receivable reduced cash flow greater expense associated with collection effort and increased bad debt expense if retailer of our product experience severe financial difficulty some may become insolvent and cease business operation which could negatively impact the sale of our product to consumer if contract manufacturer of our product or other participant in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit market to purchase raw material or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital need it may result in delay or non delivery of shipment of our product our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuation in our operating result we experience moderate fluctuation in aggregate sale volume during the year historically revenue in the first and fourth fiscal quarter have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarter however the mix of product sale may vary considerably from time to time result of change in seasonal and geographic demand for particular type of footwear apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting event including without limitation the olympics and the european football championship in addition our customer may cancel order change delivery schedule or change the mix of product ordered with minimal notice result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sale accordingly our result of operation are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period this seasonality along with other factor that are beyond our control including general economic condition change in consumer preference weather condition availability of import quota transportation disruption and currency exchange rate fluctuation could adversely affect our business and cause our result of operation to fluctuate our operating margin are also sensitive to number of additional factor that are beyond our control including manufacturing and transportation cost shift in product sale mix and geographic sale trend all of which we expect to continue result of operation in any period should not be considered indicative of the result to be expected for any future period future order may not be an accurate indication of our future revenue we make substantial use of our future ordering program which allows retailer to order five to six month in advance of delivery with the commitment that their order will be delivered within set period of time at fixed price our future ordering program allows to minimize the amount of product we hold in inventory purchasing cost the time necessary to fill customer order and the risk of non delivery we report change in future order in our periodic financial report although we believe future order are an important indicator of our future revenue reported future order are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue for any future period this is due to year over year change in shipment timing change in the mix of order between future and at once order and because the fulfillment of certain order may fall outside of the schedule noted above in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation well differing level of order cancellation discount and return can cause difference in the comparison between future order and actual revenue moreover portion of our revenue is not derived from future order including sale of at once and closeout nike brand footwear and apparel all sale of nike brand equipment the difference between retail sale and internal order from our direct to consumer in line store and commerce operation and sale from converse nike golf and hurley our future ordering program doe not prevent excess inventory or inventory shortage which could result in decreased operating margin reduced cash flow and harm to our business we purchase product from manufacturer outside of our future ordering program and in advance of customer order which we hold in inventory and resell to customer there is risk we may be unable to sell excess product ordered from manufacturer inventory level in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write down and the sale of excess inventory at discounted price could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating result financial condition and cash flow conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our product or if our manufacturer fail to supply product we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortage inventory shortage might delay shipment to customer negatively impact retailer and distributor relationship and diminish brand loyalty the difficulty in forecasting demand also make it difficult to estimate our future result of operation financial condition and cash flow from period to period failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our product could adversely affect our net revenue and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effect with any certainty in advance of contentswe may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customer we extend credit to our customer based on an assessment of customer financial condition generally without requiring collateral to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal product we offer customer the ability to place order five to six month ahead of delivery under our future ordering program these advance order may be canceled and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailer or retailer struggling with economic uncertainty in the past some customer have experienced financial difficulty up to and including bankruptcy which have had an adverse effect on our sale our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition when the retail economy weakens retailer may be more cautious with order slowing economy in our key market could adversely affect the financial health of our customer which in turn could have an adverse effect on our result of operation and financial condition in addition product sale are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing store environment to attract consumer which requires continuing investment by retailer retailer that experience financial difficulty may fail to make such investment or delay them resulting in lower sale and order for our product consolidation of retailer or concentration of retail market share among retailer may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell product the athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail market in some country are dominated by few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailer with many store these retailer have in the past increased their market share and may continue to do so in the future by expanding through acquisition and construction of additional store these situation concentrate our credit risk with relatively small number of retailer and if any of these retailer were to experience shortage of liquidity it would increase the risk that their outstanding payable to may not be paid in addition increasing market share concentration among one or few retailer in particular country or region increase the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchase of our product we may be unable to find sufficient number of other retail outlet for our product to sustain the same level of sale and revenue our direct to consumer operation have required and will continue to require substantial investment and commitment of resource and are subject to numerous risk and uncertainty our direct to consumer store have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvement information system inventory and personnel we have entered into substantial operating lease commitment for retail space certain store have been designed and built to serve high profile venue to promote brand awareness and marketing activity because of their unique design element location and size these store require substantially more investment than other store due to the high fixed cost structure associated with our direct to consumer operation decline in sale or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple store could result in significant lease termination cost write offs of equipment and leasehold improvement and employee related cost many factor unique to retail operation some of which are beyond the company control pose risk and uncertainty risk include but are not limited to credit card fraud mismanagement of existing retail channel partner and inability to manage cost associated with store construction and operation in addition extreme

the united state in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from change in currency exchange rate our primary foreign currency exposure arise from the recording of transaction denominated in non functional currency and the translation of foreign currency denominated result of operation financial position and cash flow into dollar our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effect of currency fluctuation on our consolidated result of operation financial position and cash flow we manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on portfolio basis to address those risk that are material to nike inc we manage these exposure by taking advantage of natural offset and currency correlation that exist within the portfolio and where practical and material by hedging portion of the remaining exposure using derivative instrument such forward contract and option described below the implementation of the nike trading company ntc and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offset and currency correlation benefit that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposure our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate change on the underlying net exposure being hedged where exposure are hedged our program ha the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movement on our consolidated financial statement the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizon we do not hold or issue derivative instrument for trading or speculative purpose transactional exposureswe conduct business in various currency and have transaction which subject to foreign currency risk our most significant transactional foreign currency exposure are product cost nike product cost are exposed to fluctuation in foreign currency in the following way product purchase denominated in currency other than the functional currency of the transacting entity certain nike entity purchase product from the ntc wholly owned sourcing hub that buy nike branded product from third party factory predominantly in dollar the ntc whose functional currency is the dollar then sell the product to nike entity in their respective functional currency when the ntc sell to nike entity with different functional currency the result is foreign currency exposure for the ntc other nike entity purchase product directly from third party factory in dollar these purchase generate foreign currency exposure for those nike entity with functional currency other than the dollar in both purchasing scenario weaker dollar decrease the inventory cost incurred by nike whereas stronger dollar increase it cost of factory input cost nike operates foreign currency adjustment program with certain factory the program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factory foreign currency exposure some of which are natural offset to our existing foreign currency exposure under this program our payment to these factory are adjusted for rate fluctuation in the basket of currency factory currency exposure index in which the labor material and overhead cost incurred by the factory in the production of nike branded product factory input cost are denominated for the

matures august with one year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date provided that in no event shall it extend beyond august this facility replaces the prior billion credit facility agreement entered into on november which would have matured november of and for the period ended may and we had no amount outstanding under either committed credit facility of contentswe currently have long term debt rating of aa and from standard and poor corporation and moody investor service respectively if our long term debt rating were to decline the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase conversely if our long term debt rating were to improve the facility fee and interest rate would decrease change in our long term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowing or any future borrowing under the committed credit facility under this committed revolving credit facility we have agreed to various covenant these covenant include limit on our disposal of fixed asset the amount of debt secured by lien we may incur well limit on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth in the event we were to have any borrowing outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain waiver from majority of the bank in the syndicate any borrowing would

we routinely repatriate portion of our foreign earnings for which tax have previously been provided we also indefinitely reinvest significant portion of our foreign earnings and our current plan do not demonstrate need to repatriate these earnings should we require additional capital in the united state we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign fund or raise capital in the

relating to the enforceability of intellectual property right coverage for legal issue that arise and other item where we are acting the guarantor currently we have several such agreement in place

for their use it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis the contract generally do not stipulate specific amount of cash to be spent on the product the amount of product provided to the endorser will depend on many factor including general playing condition the number of sporting event in which they participate and our own decision regarding product

accompanying note to the consolidated financial statement for recently adopted and recently issued accounting standard critical accounting policiesour previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america the preparation of these financial statement requires to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent asset and liability of contentswe believe that the estimate assumption and judgment involved in the accounting policy described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statement so we consider these to be our critical accounting policy because of the uncertainty inherent in these matter actual result could differ from the estimate we use in applying the critical accounting policy certain of these critical accounting policy affect working capital account balance including the policy for revenue recognition the allowance for uncollectible account receivable inventory reserve and contingent payment under endorsement contract these policy require that we make estimate in the preparation of our financial statement of given date however since our business cycle is relatively short actual result related to these estimate are generally known within the six month period following the financial statement date thus these policy generally affect only the timing of reported amount across two to three fiscal quarter within the context of these critical accounting policy we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely event or circumstance that would result in materially different amount being reported revenue recognitionwe record wholesale revenue when title pass and the risk and reward of ownership have passed to the customer based on the term of sale title pass generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer retail store revenue are recorded at the time of sale and online store revenue are recorded upon delivery to the customer in some instance we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer our revenue may fluctuate in case when our customer delay accepting shipment of product for period of up to several week in certain country outside of the united state precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available in these case we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery time by geographic location on the basis of our test of actual transaction we have no indication that these estimate have been materially inaccurate historically part of our revenue recognition policy we record estimated sale return discount and miscellaneous claim from customer reduction to revenue at the time revenue are recorded our post invoice sale discount consist of contractual program with certain customer or discretionary discount that are expected to be granted to certain customer at later date we base our estimate on historical rate of product return discount and claim specific identification of outstanding claim and outstanding return not yet received from customer and estimated return discount and claim expected but not yet finalized with our customer actual return discount and claim in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimate if actual or expected future return discount and claim are significantly greater or lower than established reserve we record reduction or increase to net revenue in the period in which we make such determination allowance for uncollectible account receivablewe make ongoing estimate relating to the ability to collect our account receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated loss resulting from the inability of our customer to make required payment in determining the amount of the allowance we consider our historical level of credit loss and make judgment about the creditworthiness of significant customer based on ongoing credit evaluation since we can not predict future change in the financial stability of our customer actual future loss from uncollectible account may differ from our estimate if the financial condition of our customer were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payment larger allowance might be required in the event we determine that smaller or larger allowance is appropriate we would record credit or charge to operating overhead expense in the period in which such determination is made inventory reserveswe also make ongoing estimate relating to the net realizable value of inventory based upon our assumption about future demand and market condition if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is le than the cost of the inventory recorded on our book we record reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded charge to cost of sale if change in market condition result in reduction in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such determination and record charge to cost of sale contingent payment under endorsement contractsa significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payment under endorsement contract in general endorsement payment are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract however certain contract element may be accounted for differently based upon the fact and circumstance of each individual contract certain contract provide for contingent payment to endorser based upon specific achievement in their sport winning championship we record demand creation expense for these amount when the endorser achieves the specific goal certain contract provide for variable payment based upon endorser maintaining level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time maintaining specified ranking in sport for year when we determine payment are probable the amount are recorded in demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser performance in these instance to the extent that actual payment to the endorser differ from our estimate due to change in the endorser performance increased or decreased demand creation expense may be recorded in future period certain contract provide for royalty payment to endorser based upon predetermined percent of sale of particular product we expense these payment in cost of sale the related sale occur in certain contract we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payment for contract for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fee through sale of product we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sale of product in demand creation expense uniformly over the contract term of contentsproperty plant and equipment and definite lived assetsproperty plant and equipment including building equipment and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost including in some case the cost of internal labor and are depreciated over the estimated useful life change in circumstance such technological advance or change to our business operation can result in difference between the actual and estimated useful life in those case where we determine that the useful life of long lived asset should be shortened we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset net book value to it salvage value we review the carrying value of long lived asset or asset group to be used in operation whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of the asset might not be recoverable factor that would necessitate an impairment assessment include significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used significant adverse change in legal factor or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such fact indicate potential impairment we would ass the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodology that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flow any impairment would be measured the difference between the asset group carrying amount and it estimated fair value goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset we perform annual impairment test on goodwill and intangible asset with indefinite life in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when event occur or circumstance change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below it carrying value event or change in circumstance that may trigger interim impairment review include significant change in business climate operating result planned investment in the reporting unit planned divestiture or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among other factor we may first ass qualitative factor to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount if after assessing the totality of event and circumstance we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than it carrying amount the two step impairment test is unnecessary the two step impairment test requires to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit if the carrying value of reporting unit exceeds it fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over it implied fair value if any we generally base our measurement of the fair value of reporting unit on blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flow and the market valuation approach the discounted cash flow model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flow that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future our significant estimate in the discounted cash flow model include our weighted average cost of capital long term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit business and working capital effect the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded company in similar line of business significant estimate in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar company with comparable business factor such size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiple in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit indefinite lived intangible asset primarily consist of acquired trade name and trademark we may first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired if after assessing the totality of event and circumstance we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is not impaired no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary if quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible asset we utilize the relief from royalty method this method assumes that trade name and trademark have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalty for the benefit received from them this method requires to estimate the future revenue for the related brand the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital fair value measurementsfor financial asset and liability measured at fair value on recurring basis fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer liability in an orderly transaction with market participant at the measurement date in general and where applicable we use quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability to determine the fair value of our financial instrument this pricing methodology applies to our level investment including treasury security in the absence of active market for identical asset or liability such measurement involve developing assumption based on market observable data including quoted price for similar asset or liability in active market and quoted price for identical or similar asset or liability in market that are not active this pricing methodology applies to our level investment such time deposit commercial paper and bond agency security and money market fund level investment are valued using internally developed model with unobservable input asset and liability measured using unobservable input are an immaterial portion of our portfolio majority of our available for sale security are priced by pricing vendor and are generally level or level investment these vendor either provide quoted market price in an active market or use observable input without applying significant adjustment in their pricing observable input include broker quote interest rate and yield curve observable at commonly quoted interval volatility and credit risk our fair value process include control that are designed to ensure appropriate fair value are recorded these control include comparison to another independent pricing vendor of contentshedge accounting for derivativeswe use derivative contract to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transaction well certain non functional currency monetary asset and liability when the specific criterion to qualify for hedge accounting ha been met change in the fair value of contract hedging probable forecasted future cash flow are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affect net income in most case this result in gain and loss on hedge derivative being released from other comprehensive income into net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative one of the criterion for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contract should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transaction by their very nature our estimate of anticipated transaction may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transaction when anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decline below hedged level or if it is no longer probable that forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two month period of time thereafter we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over hedged portion of the related hedge contract from other comprehensive income to other income expense net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs we have used in the past and may use in the future forward contract or option to hedge our investment in the net asset of certain international subsidiary to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiary the change in fair value of the forward contract or option hedging our net investment is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within total shareholder equity to the extent effective to offset the foreign currency translation adjustment on those investment the value of our underlying net investment in wholly owned international subsidiary is known at the time hedge is placed the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk accordingly the variability involved in net investment hedge is substantially le than that of other type of hedge transaction and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness we consider on quarterly basis the need to redesignate existing hedge relationship based on change in the underlying net investment should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged level the cumulative change in fair value of the over hedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported other income expense net during the period in which change occur stock based compensationwe account for stock based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock based compensation on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumption including volatility expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded option on our common stock with term greater than one year along with other factor our decision to use implied volatility wa based on the availability of actively traded option on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trend than historical volatility if factor change and we use different assumption for estimating stock based compensation expense in future period stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period income taxeswe record valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset when necessary realization of deferred tax asset such net operating loss carry forward is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we ass the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset which increase our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made in addition we have not recorded income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united state thus reducing our overall income tax expense the amount of earnings designated indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore asset and our expectation of the future cash need of our and foreign entity income tax consideration are also factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore we carefully review all factor that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standard to overcome the presumption of repatriation despite this approach because the determination involves our future plan and expectation of future event the possibility exists that amount declared indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated for instance the actual cash need of our entity may exceed our current expectation or the actual cash need of our foreign entity may be le than our current expectation this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amount were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore conversely our approach may also result in determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which income tax have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore in this case our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination on an interim basis we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year this estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year to date income before income tax excluding infrequently occurring or unusual item to determine the year to date income tax expense the income tax effect of infrequent or unusual item are recognized in the interim period in which they occur the fiscal year progress we continually refine our estimate based upon actual event and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically result in change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs on quarterly basis we evaluate the probability that tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax position based on factor including change in fact or circumstance change in tax law settled audit issue and new audit activity change in our assessment may result in the recognition of tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment change we recognize interest and penalty related to income tax matter in income tax expense of contentsother contingenciesin the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceeding regarding contractual and employment relationship product liability claim trademark right and variety of other matter we record contingent liability resulting from claim against including related legal cost when loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable assessing probability of loss and estimating probable loss requires analysis of multiple factor including in some case judgment about the potential action of third party claimant and court recorded contingent liability are based on the best information available and actual loss in any future period are inherently uncertain if future adjustment to estimated probable future loss or actual loss exceed our recorded liability for such claim we would record additional charge during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred in addition to contingent liability recorded for probable loss we disclose contingent liability when there is reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability while we can not predict the outcome of pending legal matter with certainty we do not believe any currently identified claim proceeding or litigation either individually or in aggregate will have material impact on our result of operation financial position or cash flow of contentsitem quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskin the normal course of business and consistent with established policy and procedure we employ variety of financial instrument to manage exposure to fluctuation in the value of foreign currency and interest rate it is our policy to utilize these financial instrument only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposure we do not enter into these transaction for trading or speculative purpose we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation primarily result of our international sale product sourcing and funding activity our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effect of currency fluctuation on our consolidated result of operation financial position and cash flow we use forward and option contract to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transaction well certain firm commitment and the related receivables and payable including third party and intercompany transaction we have in the past and may in the future also use forward or option contract to hedge our investment in the net asset of certain international subsidiary to offset foreign currency translation adjustment related to our net investment in those subsidiary where exposure are hedged our program ha the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movement on our consolidated financial statement the timing for hedging exposure well the type and duration of the hedge instrument employed are guided by our hedging policy and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market condition typically the company may enter into hedge contract starting up to to month in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedge up to of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs the majority of derivative outstanding of may are designated foreign currency cash flow hedge primarily for euro dollar british pound euro and japanese yen dollar currency pair see section foreign currency exposure and hedging practice under item for additional detail our earnings are also exposed to movement in short and long term market interest rate our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate change on earnings and cash flow and to reduce overall borrowing cost to achieve these objective we maintain mix of commercial paper bank loan fixed rate debt of varying maturity and have entered into receive fixed pay variable interest rate swap for portion of our fixed rate debt well pay fixed receive variable forward starting interest rate swap for cash outflow of interest payment on future debt market risk measurementwe monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivative using variety of technique including review of market value sensitivity analysis and value at risk var our market sensitive derivative and other financial instrument are foreign currency forward contract foreign currency option contract interest rate swap intercompany loan denominated in non functional currency fixed interest rate dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instrument only the var determines the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate sensitive financial instrument the var model estimate assume normal market condition and confidence level there are various modeling technique that can be used in the var computation our computation are based on interrelationship between currency and interest rate variance co variance technique these interrelationship are function of foreign exchange currency market change and interest rate change over the preceding one year period the value of foreign currency option doe not change on one to one basis with change in the underlying currency rate we adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the delta and gamma to change in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuation on the derivative instrument only and doe not include the impact of such rate fluctuation on non functional currency transaction such anticipated transaction firm commitment cash balance and account and loan receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instrument the var model is risk analysis tool and doe not purport to represent actual loss in fair value that we will incur nor doe it consider the potential effect of favorable change in market rate it also doe not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gain and loss will differ from those estimated because of change or difference in market rate and interrelationship hedging instrument and hedge percentage timing and other factor the estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instrument derived using the var model wa million and million at may and respectively the var decreased year over year result of decrease in the total notional value of our foreign currency derivative portfolio at may such hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivative would be offset by increase in the value of the underlying transaction being hedged the average monthly change in the fair value of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instrument wa million and million during fiscal and fiscal respectively the instrument not included in the var are intercompany loan denominated in non functional currency fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt fixed interest rate dollar denominated debt and interest rate swap intercompany loan and related interest amount are eliminated in consolidation furthermore our non functional currency intercompany loan are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contract which are included in the var calculation above therefore we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risk associated with our non functional currency intercompany loan to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position result from operation and cash flow during the year ended may we entered into series of forward starting interest rate swap agreement forward starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedge the variability in future benchmark interest payment attributable to change in interest rate on the forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt we entered into these forward starting interest rate swap in order to lock in fixed interest rate on our forecasted issuance of debt these instrument were designated cash

development cost of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed an integral part of product are subject to capitalization beginning when product technological feasibility ha been established and ending when product is available for general release to customer in most instance the company product are released soon after technological feasibility ha been established therefore software development cost incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant and generally most software development cost have been expensed incurred of contentsimpairment of long lived assetsthe company review the carrying value of long lived asset or asset group to be used in operation whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of the asset might not be recoverable factor that would necessitate an impairment assessment include significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used significant adverse change in legal factor or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such fact indicate potential impairment the company would ass the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable the company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodology which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flow any impairment would be measured the difference between the asset group carrying amount and it estimated fair value goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assetsthe company performs annual impairment test on goodwill and intangible asset with indefinite life in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when event occur or circumstance change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below it carrying value event or change in circumstance that may trigger interim impairment review include significant change in business climate operating result planned investment in the reporting unit planned divestiture or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among other factor the company may first ass qualitative factor to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount if after assessing the totality of event and circumstance the company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than it carrying amount the two step impairment test is unnecessary the two step impairment test first requires the company to estimate the fair value of it reporting unit if the carrying value of reporting unit exceeds it fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and the company proceeds to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis the company measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying

trading company ntc wholly owned sourcing hub that buy nike branded product from third party factory predominantly in dollar the ntc whose functional currency is the dollar then sell the product to nike entity in their respective functional currency when the ntc sell to nike entity with different functional currency the result is foreign currency exposure for the ntc other nike entity purchase product directly from third party factory in dollar these purchase generate foreign currency exposure for those nike entity with functional currency other than the dollar the company operates foreign

natural offset to the company existing foreign currency exposure under this program the company payment to these factory are adjusted for rate fluctuation in the basket of currency factory currency exposure index in which the labor material and overhead cost incurred by the factory in the production of nike branded product factory input cost are denominated for the portion of the index denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory the company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedge for all currency within the index excluding the dollar and the local

charge or deferred credit respectively the company ass the effectiveness of option based on the total cash flow method and record total change in the option fair value to accumulated other comprehensive income to the degree they are effective the company formally ass both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivative that are used in the hedging transaction have been highly effective in offsetting change in the cash flow of hedged item and whether those derivative may be expected to remain highly effective in future period effectiveness for cash flow hedge is assessed based on change in forward rate ineffectiveness wa billion for the year ended may and the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it determines that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting change in the cash flow of hedged item including hedged item such firm commitment or forecasted transaction the derivative expires or is sold terminated or exercised it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur or management determines that designating the derivative hedging instrument is no longer appropriate when the company

period of time thereafter the gain or loss on the derivative remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified to net income when the forecasted transaction affect consolidated net income however if it is probable that forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two month period of time thereafter the gain and loss that were in accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in other income expense net in all situation in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative
