in addition to the factor discussed elsewhere in this report the following are some of the important factor that individually or in the aggregate we believe could make our actual result differ materially from those described in any forward looking statement it is impossible to predict or identify all such factor and result you should not consider the following factor to be complete discussion of risk uncertainty and assumption macroeconomic risk our business is highly sensitive to global and regional economic condition and economic condition in the industry we serve our result of operation are materially affected by economic condition globally and regionally and in the particular industry we serve the demand for our product and service tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in period of economic weakness characterized by lower level of government and business investment lower level of business confidence lower corporate earnings perceived or actual industry overcapacity higher unemployment and lower consumer spending prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in increased expense due to higher allowance for doubtful account and potential goodwill and asset impairment charge economic condition vary across region and country and demand for our product and service generally increase in those region and country experiencing economic growth and investment slower economic growth or change in the global mix of region and country experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition the energy transportation and mining industry are major user of our product including the coal iron ore gold copper oil and natural gas industry customer in these industry frequently base their decision to purchase our product on the expected future performance of these industry which in turn are dependent in part on commodity price price of commodity in these industry are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictibly in response to general economic condition and trend government action regulatory action commodity inventory production level market expectation and any disruption in production or distribution economic condition affecting the industry we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditure by our customer reduced capital expenditure by our customer are likely to lead to decrease in the demand for our product and may also result in decrease in demand for aftermarket part customer are likely to extend preventative maintenance schedule and delay major overhaul when possible the rate of infrastructure spending housing start and commercial construction also play significant role in our result our product are an integral component of these activity and these activity decrease demand for our product may be significantly impacted which could negatively impact our result of contentscommodity price change material price increase fluctuation in demand for our product or significant shortage of material may adversely impact our financial result or our ability to meet commitment to customer we are significant user of steel and many other commodity required for the manufacture of our product increase in the price of such commodity would increase our cost negatively impacting our business result of operation and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased cost through price increase productivity improvement or cost reduction program we rely on supplier to secure material particularly steel required for the manufacture of our product disruption in delivery to or from supplier or decreased availability of raw material or commodity could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitment to customer or increase our operating cost on the other hand if demand for our product is le than we expect we may experience excess inventory and be forced to incur additional charge and our profitability may suffer our business competitive position result of operation or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operation if we experience excess inventory or if we are unable to adjust our production schedule or our purchase from supplier to reflect change in customer demand and market fluctuation on timely basis change in government monetary or fiscal policy may negatively impact our result most country where our product and service are sold have established central bank to regulate monetary system and influence economic activity generally by adjusting interest rate interest rate change affect overall economic growth which affect demand for residential and nonresidential structure well energy and mined product which in turn affect sale of our product and service that serve these activity interest rate change may also affect our customer ability to finance machine purchase can change the optimal time to keep machine in fleet and can impact the ability of our supplier to finance the production of part and component necessary to manufacture and support our product increase in interest rate could negatively impact sale and create supply chain inefficiency central bank and other policy arm of many country take action to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy the impact from change in liquidity and credit policy could impact the customer and market we serve or our supplier which could adversely impact our business result of operation and financial condition change in monetary and fiscal policy along with other factor may cause currency exchange rate to fluctuate action that lead the currency exchange rate of country where we manufacture product to increase relative to other currency could reduce the competitiveness of product made in that country which could adversely affect our competitive position result of operation and financial condition government policy on tax and spending also affect our business throughout the world government spending finance significant portion of infrastructure development such highway airport sewer and water system and dam tax regulation determine depreciation life and the amount of money user of our product can retain both of which influence investment decision unfavorable development such decline in government revenue decision to reduce public spending or increase in tax could negatively impact our result our global operation are exposed to political and economic risk commercial instability and event beyond our control in the country in which we operate our global operation are dependent upon product manufactured purchased and sold in the and internationally including in country with political and economic instability or uncertainty this includes for example the uncertainty related to the united kingdom june vote to leave the european union commonly known brexit some country have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruption than others our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuation in freight cost limitation on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruption in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic point of exit and entry for our product operating in number of different region and country expose to number of risk including multiple and potentially conflicting law regulation and policy that are subject to change imposition of currency restriction restriction on repatriation of earnings or other restraint imposition of burdensome tariff or quota change in trade agreement of content imposition of new or additional trade and economic sanction law imposed by the or foreign government war or terrorist act and political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected country the occurrence of one or more of these event may negatively impact our business result of operation and financial condition operational risksthe success of our business depends on our ability to develop produce and market quality product that meet our customer need our business relies on continued global demand for our brand and product to achieve business goal we must develop and sell product that appeal to our dealer oems and end user customer this is dependent on number of factor including our ability to maintain key dealer relationship our ability to produce product that meet

including engine exhaust emission requirement or to predict market demand for or gain market acceptance of our product could have negative impact on our business result of operation and financial condition we operate in highly competitive environment which could adversely affect our sale and pricing we operate in highly competitive environment we compete on the basis of variety of factor including product performance customer service quality and price there can be no assurance that our product will be able to compete successfully with other company product thus our share of industry sale could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategy pursued by competitor unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulty our failure to price our product competitively our failure to produce our product at competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitor new machine or dealer owned rental fleet leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rate and or used equipment price lack of customer acceptance of price increase we announce from time to time change in customer requirement for price discount change in our customer behavior or weak pricing environment attributable to industry overcapacity could have an adverse impact on our business result of operation and financial condition in addition our result and ability to compete may be impacted

instability in the region and the negative impact of currency sale declined in north america mostly due to the absence of several large project and unfavorable impact of change in dealer inventory inventory decreased in and were about flat in industrial sale decreased in all region except latin america which wa about flat in eame sale decreased primarily due to lower end user demand for engine used by original equipment manufacturer for agriculture and construction application and the unfavorable impact of currency in both asia pacific and north america lower demand for most industrial application contributed to the sale decrease energy transportation profit wa billion in compared with billion in the decrease wa primarily due to lower sale volume which includes favorable mix of product partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense variable manufacturing cost were about flat improved material cost were about offset by the unfavorable impact of cost absorption and manufacturing inefficiency driven by cost decreasing at lower rate than production volume the unfavorable impact of cost absorption resulted from significant decrease in inventory in compared to an increase in inventory in period cost were favorable lower incentive compensation expense wa slightly offset by increase in program spending including for new product introduction financial product

obligation are not included in the table above we do not expect to make tax payment related to these obligation within the next year that would significantly impact liquidity critical accounting policy the preparation of financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect reported amount the more significant estimate include residual value for leased asset fair value for goodwill impairment test impairment of available for sale security warranty liability stock based compensation reserve for product liability and insurance loss postretirement benefit post sale discount credit loss and income tax we have incorporated many year of data into the determination of each of these estimate and we have not historically experienced significant adjustment these assumption are reviewed at least annually with the audit committee of the board of director following are the method and assumption used in determining our estimate and an indication of the risk inherent in each of content residual value for leased asset the residual value for cat financial leased asset which are an estimate of the market value of leased equipment at the end of the lease term are based on an analysis of historical wholesale market sale price projected forward on level trend line without consideration for inflation or possible future pricing action at the inception of the lease residual value are estimated with consideration of the following critical factor market size and demand any known significant market product trend total expected hour of usage machine configuration application location model change quantity past marketing experience third party residual guarantee and contractual customer purchase option many of these factor are gathered in an application survey that is completed prior to quotation the lease agreement also clearly defines applicable return condition and remedy for non compliance to ensure that the leased equipment will be in good operating condition upon return model change and update well market strength and product acceptance are monitored and adjustment are made to residual value in accordance with the significance of any such change remarketing sale staff work closely with customer and dealer to manage the sale of lease return and the recovery of residual exposure during the term of the equipment on operating lease we evaluate our depreciation on regular basis taking into consideration expected residual value at lease termination adjustment to depreciation expense reflecting revised estimate of expected residual value at the end of the lease term are recorded prospectively on straight line basis for finance lease residual value adjustment are recognized through reduction of finance revenue we evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating lease for potential impairment when we determine triggering event ha occurred when triggering event occurs test for recoverability is performed by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flow to the carrying value of the equipment on operating lease if the test for recoverability identifies possible impairment the fair value of the equipment on operating lease is measured in accordance with the fair value measurement framework an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment on operating lease exceeds it estimated fair value at december the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating lease wa billion without consideration of other factor such third party residual guarantee or contractual customer purchase option non temporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating lease would reduce residual value estimate and result in the recognition of approximately million of additional annual depreciation expense fair value for goodwill impairment test we test goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level and whenever event or circumstance make it likely that an impairment may have occurred such significant adverse change in the business climate or decision to sell all or portion of reporting unit we perform our annual goodwill impairment test of october and monitor for interim triggering event on an ongoing basis goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either qualitative assessment or two step process if we choose to perform qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is necessary for reporting unit where we perform the two step process the first step requires to compare the fair value of each reporting unit which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flow to the respective carrying value which includes goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds it carrying value the goodwill is not considered impaired if the carrying value is higher than the fair value there is an indication that an impairment may exist and the second step is required in step two the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated the excess of the fair value of reporting unit over the fair value assigned to it asset and liability if the implied fair value of goodwill is le than the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill the difference is recognized an impairment loss the impairment test process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit which we primarily determine using an income approach based on discounted five year forecasted cash flow with year five residual value the residual value is computed using the constant growth method which value the forecasted cash flow in perpetuity the income approach is supported by reconciliation of our calculated fair value for caterpillar to the company market capitalization the assumption about future cash flow and growth rate are based on each reporting unit long term forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management reporting unit discount rate is risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital which we believe approximates the rate from market participant perspective the estimated fair value could be impacted by change in market condition interest rate growth rate tax rate cost pricing and capital expenditure the fair value determination is categorized level in the fair value hierarchy due to it use of internal projection and unobservable measurement input in our resource industry segment had two reporting unit with goodwill hauling extraction and material handling underground effective january product responsibility for off highway truck and wheel tractor scraper transferred from hauling extraction to material handling underground and the former hauling extraction reporting unit wa renamed surface mining technology result of the transfer in product responsibility approximately million of goodwill wa of contentsreassigned from hauling extraction to material handling underground based on the relative fair value of the product transferred to the total fair value of hauling extraction after the reassignment of goodwill surface mining technology and material handling underground had goodwill of approximately billion and billion respectively of january because the former hauling extraction reporting unit fair value wa not substantially in excess of it carrying value of october we tested surface mining technology goodwill for impairment of january and concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit continued to exceed it carrying value our annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of indicated the fair value of each reporting unit wa substantially above it respective carrying value including goodwill with the exception of our surface mining technology reporting unit caterpillar market capitalization ha remained significantly above the net book value of the company the surface mining technology reporting unit which primarily serf the mining industry is part of our resource industry segment the goodwill assigned to this reporting unit is largely from our acquisition of bucyrus international inc in it product portfolio includes large mining truck electric rope shovel draglines hydraulic shovel and related part in addition to equipment surface mining technology also develops and sell technology product and service to provide customer fleet management equipment management analytics and autonomous machine capability the annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of indicated that the fair value of surface mining technology wa below it carrying value requiring the second step of the goodwill impairment test process we assigned the fair value to surface mining technology asset and liability using various valuation technique that required assumption about royalty rate dealer attrition technological obsolescence and discount rate the resulting implied fair value of goodwill wa below the carrying value accordingly we recognized goodwill impairment charge of million which resulted in goodwill of million remaining for surface mining technology of october there wa million tax benefit associated with this impairment charge the mining industry ha experienced significant weakness for several year result of low commodity price while we continue to expect the industry will improve we believe the pace of the improvement will be slower and cash flow and profitability will be lower than previously forecasted we believe the slow pace of improvement will in part be due to large amount of equipment currently idled particularly large mining truck some of which will be redeployed end user demand increase in addition we do not expect dramatic increase in commodity price dampening the rate of growth in mining production and demand for our product to reflect the gradual nature of the anticipated improvement we used ten year cash flow forecast period for the reporting unit rather than our typical five year forecast period in addition to surface mining technology our resource industry segment ha reporting unit material handling underground which includes goodwill of approximately billion of october also largely from our acquisition of bucyrus international inc in material handling underground product portfolio includes large track type tractor hard rock vehicle longwall miner track and rotary drill highwall miner large wheel loader off highway truck articulated truck wheel tractor scraper wheel dozer landfill compactors soil compactors material handler continuous miner scoop and hauler hardrock continuous mining system and related part the fair value of material handling underground remains substantially above it carrying value an unfavorable change in our expectation for the financial performance of our reporting unit particularly long term growth and profitability would reduce the fair value of our reporting unit the demand for our equipment and related part is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity price although the impact may vary by reporting unit the energy and mining industry are major user of our product including the coal iron ore gold copper oil and natural gas industry decision to purchase our product are dependent upon the performance of those industry which in turn are dependent in part on commodity price lower commodity price or industry specific circumstance that have negative impact to the valuation assumption may reduce the fair value of our reporting unit should such event occur and it becomes more likely than not that reporting unit fair value ha fallen below it carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment test may result in goodwill impairment depending on the outcome of both step one and step two of the impairment review process goodwill impairment would be reported non cash charge to earnings impairment of available for sale security available for sale security primarily at insurance service are reviewed at least quarterly to identify fair value below cost which may indicate that security is impaired and should be written down to fair value for debt security security fair value is below cost we utilize data gathered by investment manager external source and internal research to monitor the performance of the security to determine whether an other than temporary impairment ha occurred these review which include an analysis of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before it anticipated recovery consist of both quantitative and qualitative analysis and require degree of management judgment security in loss position are monitored and assessed at least quarterly based on severity and timing of loss and may be deemed other than temporarily impaired at any time once security fair value ha been percent or more below it original of contentscost for six consecutive month the security will be other than temporarily impaired unless there are sufficient fact and circumstance supporting otherwise for equity security in loss position determining whether security is other than temporarily impaired requires an analysis of that security historical sector return well the volatility of that return this information is utilized to estimate security future fair value and to ass whether the security ha the ability to recover to it original cost over reasonable period of time both historical annualized sector return and the volatility of those return are applied over two year period to arrive at these estimate for both debt and equity security qualitative factor are also considered in determining whether security is other than temporarily impaired these include review of the following significant change in the regulatory economic or technological environment of the investee significant change in the general market condition of either the geographic area or the industry in which the investee operates and length of time and the extent to which the fair value ha been le than cost these qualitative factor are subjective and require degree of management judgment warranty liability at the time sale is recognized we record estimated future warranty cost the warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory generally historical claim rate are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model engine size by customer or dealer location inside or outside north america specific rate are developed for each product shipment month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience warranty cost may differ from those estimated if actual claim rate are higher or lower than our historical rate stock based compensation we use lattice based option pricing model to calculate the fair value of our stock option and sars the calculation of the fair value of the award using the lattice based option pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant well assumption regarding the following volatility is measure of the amount by which the stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected term of the award and is based on historical caterpillar stock price movement and current implied volatility from traded option on caterpillar stock the implied volatility from traded option are impacted by change in market condition an increase in the volatility would result in an increase in our expense the expected term represents the period of time that award granted are expected to be outstanding and is an output of the lattice based option pricing model in determining the expected term of the award future exercise and forfeiture pattern are estimated from caterpillar employee historical exercise behavior these pattern are also affected by the vesting condition of the award change in the future exercise behavior of employee or in the vesting period of the award could result in change in the expected term an increase in the expected term would result in an increase to our expense the weighted average dividend yield is based on caterpillar historical dividend yield holder of stock option and sars do not receive dividend payment this could result in employee retaining the award for longer period of time if dividend yield decrease or exercising the award sooner if dividend yield increase decrease in the dividend yield would result in an increase in our expense the risk free interest rate is based on the treasury yield curve in effect at time of grant the risk free interest rate increase the expected term increase resulting in an increase in our expense the fair value of our rsus and prsus is determined by reducing the stock price on the date of grant by the present value of the estimated dividend to be paid during the vesting period the estimated dividend are based on caterpillar quarterly dividend per share at the time of grant decrease in the dividend per share would result in an increase in our expense stock based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the number of award that are expected to vest in determining the stock based compensation expense to be recognized forfeiture rate is applied to the fair value of the award this rate represents the number of award that are expected to be forfeited prior to vesting and is based on caterpillar employee historical behavior change in the future behavior of employee could impact this rate decrease in this rate would result in an increase in our expense stock based compensation expense for prsus is based on the probable number of share expected to vest change in the expected probability of achieving performance target in future period may result in an increase or decrease in our expense product liability and insurance loss reserve we determine these reserve based upon reported claim in process of settlement and actuarial estimate for loss incurred but not reported loss reserve including incurred but not reported reserve are based on estimate and ultimate settlement may vary significantly from such estimate due to increased claim frequency or severity over historical level of content postretirement benefit primary actuarial assumption were determined follows the assumed discount rate is used to discount future benefit obligation back to today dollar the discount rate is based on benefit cash flow matching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligation could effectively be settled of our measurement date december the benefit cash flow matching approach involves analyzing caterpillar projected cash flow against high quality bond yield curve calculated using wide population of corporate aa bond available on the measurement date the highest and lowest yielding bond top and bottom percent are excluded from the analysis similar approach is used to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant non plan discount rate are sensitive to change in interest rate decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation and future expense at december we changed our method for calculating the service and interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost historically these component were determined utilizing single weighted average discount rate based on the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period beginning in we elected to utilize full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest cost by applying the specific spot rate along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flow we made this change to provide more precise measurement of service and interest cost by improving the correlation between the projected cash flow to the corresponding spot rate along the yield curve this change ha no impact on our pension and other postretirement liability and ha been accounted for prospectively change in accounting estimate beginning in the first quarter of the expected long term rate of return on plan asset is based on our estimate of long term passive return for equity and fixed income security weighted by the allocation of our plan asset based on historical performance we increase the passive return due to our active management of the plan asset this rate is impacted by change in general market condition but because it represents long term rate it is not significantly impacted by short term market swing change in our allocation of plan asset would also impact this rate for example shift to more fixed income security would lower the rate decrease in the rate would increase our expense the expected return on plan asset is calculated using the fair value of plan asset of our measurement date december the expected rate of compensation increase is used to develop benefit obligation using projected pay at retirement it represents average long term salary increase this rate is influenced by our long term compensation policy an increase in the rate would increase our obligation and expense the assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care cost are assumed to increase and is based on historical and expected experience change in our projection of future health care cost due to general economic condition and those specific to health care technology driven cost change will impact this trend rate an increase in the trend rate would increase our obligation and expense the effect of actual result differing from our assumption and the effect of changing assumption are considered actuarial gain or loss we recognize actuarial gain or loss immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis triggering event warrant remeasurement see note for further information regarding the accounting for postretirement benefit post sale discount reserve we provide discount to dealer through merchandising program we have numerous program that are designed to promote the sale of our product the most common dealer program provide discount when the dealer sell product to targeted end user the amount of accrued post sale discount wa million and million of december and respectively the reserve represents discount that we expect to pay on previously sold unit and is reviewed at least quarterly the reserve is adjusted if discount paid differ from those estimated historically those adjustment have not been material credit loss reserve the allowance for credit loss is an estimate of the loss inherent in our finance receivable portfolio and includes consideration of account that have been individually identified impaired well pool of finance receivables where it is probable that certain receivables in the pool are impaired but the individual account can not yet be identified in identifying and measuring impairment management take into consideration past loss experience known and inherent risk in the portfolio adverse situation that may affect the borrower ability to repay estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic condition of contentsaccounts are identified for individual review based on past due status and information available about the customer such financial statement news report and published credit rating well general information regarding industry trend and the economic environment in which our customer operate the allowance for credit loss attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired is based either on the present value of expected future cash flow discounted at the receivables effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent receivables in determining collateral value we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral le selling cost we also consider credit enhancement such additional collateral and contractual third party guarantee the allowance for credit loss attributable to the remaining account not yet individually identified impaired is estimated based on loss forecast model utilizing probability of default our estimate of the loss emergence period and the estimated loss given default in addition qualitative factor not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast model including industry trend macroeconomic factor and model imprecision are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit loss these qualitative factor are subjective and require degree of management judgment while management belief it ha exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumption there can be no assurance that in the future change in economic condition or other factor would not cause change in the financial health of our customer if the financial health of our customer deteriorates the timing and level of payment received could be impacted and therefore could result in change to our estimated loss income tax we are subject to the income tax law of the many jurisdiction in which we operate these tax law are complex and the manner in which they apply to our fact is sometimes open to interpretation in establishing the provision for income tax we must make judgment about the application of these inherently complex tax law despite our belief that our tax return position are consistent with applicable tax law we believe that taxing authority could challenge certain position settlement of any challenge can result in no change complete disallowance or some partial adjustment reached through negotiation or litigation we record tax benefit for uncertain tax position based upon management evaluation of the information available at the reporting date to be recognized in the financial statement tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merit the benefit for position meeting the recognition threshold is measured the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with taxing authority that ha full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required in making these determination and adjustment to unrecognized tax benefit may be necessary to reflect actual tax payable upon settlement adjustment related to position impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income tax adjustment related to position impacting the timing of deduction impact deferred tax asset and liability our income tax position and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law future change in tax law could significantly impact the provision for income tax the amount of tax payable and the deferred tax asset and liability balance deferred tax asset generally represent tax benefit for tax deduction or credit available in future tax return certain estimate and assumption are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of deferred tax asset will not be realized in making this assessment management analyzes the trend of gaap earnings and estimate the impact of future taxable income reversing temporary difference and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategy should change in fact or circumstance lead to change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of deferred tax asset we record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in fact and circumstance occurs along with corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income tax the provision for income tax for includes an increase in the valuation allowance for state deferred tax asset resulting in million non cash charge net of federal deferred tax adjustment at percent the primary driver of the increase is recent gaap loss expected to recur in in certain state jurisdiction and the weight given this negative objective evidence under income tax accounting guidance reversal of the valuation allowance in the future is dependent on gaap profitability in these state jurisdiction giving le weight in the analysis to mark to market adjustment to remeasure our pension and opeb plan we do not consider these adjustment indicative of ongoing earnings trend provision for income tax ha not been recorded on undistributed profit of our non subsidiary that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the if management intention or tax law change in the future there could be significant negative impact on the provision for income tax to record an incremental tax liability in the period the change occurs deferred tax asset is recognized only if we have definite plan to generate tax benefit by repatriating earnings in the foreseeable future income tax are based on the statutory tax rate of the jurisdiction in which earnings are subject to taxation that statutory rate may differ from the statutory tax rate of the jurisdiction in which that entity is incorporated tax are paid in the jurisdiction where earnings are subject to taxation the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate in part due to indefinitely reinvested profit of non subsidiary being subject to statutory tax rate which are generally lower than the rate of of contentspercent the indefinitely reinvested profit of caterpillar sarl csarl primarily taxable in switzerland contribute the most significant amount of this difference for tax year to including the impact of loss carryback to the irs ha proposed to tax in the united state profit earned from certain part transaction by csarl based on the irs examination team application of substance over form or assignment of income judicial doctrine we are vigorously contesting the proposed increase to tax and penalty for these year of approximately billion we believe that the relevant transaction complied with applicable tax law and did not violate judicial doctrine the purchase of part by csarl from unrelated party and the subsequent sale of those part to unrelated dealer outside the united state have substantial legal commercial and economic consequence for the party involved we have filed income tax return on this same basis for year after we currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position liquidity or result of operation other matter environmental and legal matter the company is regulated by federal state and international environmental law governing our use transport and disposal of substance and control of emission in addition to governing our manufacturing and other operation these law often impact the development of our product including but not limited to required compliance with air emission standard applicable to internal combustion engine we have made and will continue to make significant research and development and capital expenditure to comply with these emission standard we are engaged in remedial activity at number of location often with other company pursuant to federal and state law when it is probable we will pay remedial cost at site and those cost can be reasonably estimated the investigation remediation and operating and maintenance cost are accrued against our earnings cost are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site including available technology current applicable law and regulation and prior remediation experience where no amount within range of estimate is more likely we accrue the minimum where multiple potentially responsible party are involved we consider our proportionate share of the probable cost in formulating the estimate of probable cost we do not consider amount expected to be recovered from insurance company or others we reassess these accrued amount on quarterly basis the amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in accrued expense we believe there is no more than remote chance that material amount for remedial activity at any individual site or at all the site in

belief loss is probable we currently believe that this matter will not have material adverse effect on the company consolidated result of operation financial position or liquidity in addition we are involved in other unresolved legal action that arise in the normal course of business the most prevalent of these unresolved action involve dispute related to product design manufacture and performance liability including claimed asbestos and welding fume exposure contract employment issue environmental matter or intellectual property right the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss in excess of accrued liability if any associated with these unresolved legal action is not material in some case we can not reasonably estimate range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter however we believe there is no more than remote chance that any liability arising from these matter would be material although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal action we believe that these action will not individually or in the aggregate have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation financial position or liquidity retirement benefitswe recognize mark to market gain and loss immediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and opeb plan mark to market gain and loss represent the effect of actual result differing from our assumption and the effect of changing assumption change in discount rate and difference between the actual return on plan asset and the expected return on plan asset generally have the largest impact on mark to market gain and loss we recognized expense of million in expense of million in and expense of billion in related to our defined benefit pension and opeb plan the increase in expense in compared to wa primarily due to higher net mark to market loss in compared to and lower expected return on plan asset result of lower asset base in compared to and lower expected rate of return on plan asset this wa partially offset by lower interest cost primarily due to adoption of full yield curve approach in the estimation of interest cost discussed below and lower service cost primarily due to fewer employee earning benefit under our plan result of the voluntary retirement enhancement program that wa implemented in the fourth quarter the decrease in expense in compared to wa primarily due to lower net mark to market loss in compared to the primary factor that resulted in mark to market loss for and are described below net mark to

million of dollar cost of good sold general and administrative expense and development expense in the fourth quarter of the mortality assumption for our pension and opeb plan wa reviewed to consider the use of new table that were released by the society of actuary soa of december the company adopted the new table with modification to reflect historical company specific mortality experience and it best estimate of future mortality improvement the adoption of the new table resulted in an increase in the life expectancy of plan participant and therefore an increase in our liability for postemployment benefit of approximately million in the fourth quarter of the mortality assumption for our pension and opeb plan wa reviewed to consider the use of new mortality improvement projection scale that were released by the soa of december the company adopted the new mortality improvement projection scale which resulted in an increase in the life expectancy of plan participant and therefore an increase in our liability for postemployment benefit of approximately million at december we changed our method for calculating the service and interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost historically these component were determined utilizing single weighted average discount rate based on yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period beginning in we elected to utilize full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest cost by applying the specific spot rate along the yield curve used in the determination of the

to the corresponding spot rate along the yield curve under the previous method the discount rate used for the service and interest component of cost would have been percent for pension percent for non pension and percent for opeb this change had no impact on our year end defined benefit pension and opeb obligation or our annual net periodic benefit cost the lower service and interest cost were entirely offset in the actuarial loss gain reported compared to the method used in this change lowered service and interest cost by million we expect our total defined benefit pension and opeb expense excluding the impact of mark to market gain and loss to increase approximately million in in general our strategy for both the and the non pension includes ongoing alignment of our investment to our liability while reducing risk in our portfolio for our pension plan our year end asset allocation wa percent equity security percent fixed income security and percent other our current pension target asset allocation is percent equity and percent fixed income the target allocation will be revisited periodically to reflect our overall objective the plan are rebalanced to plus or minus percentage

percent other the target allocation for our non pension plan wa percent equity security percent fixed income security percent real estate and percent other the target allocation for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirement demographic of the plan participant and funded status the frequency of rebalancing for the non plan varies depending on the plan contribution to our pension and

care cost trend rate at year end health care trend rate assumed for next year rate that the cost trend rate gradually decline to year that the cost trend rate reach ultimate rate sensitivity foreign exchange rate sensitivity machinery energy transportation operation use foreign currency forward and option contract to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movement that would reduce the dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to five year based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our machinery energy transportation operation for the next month and the foreign currency derivative instrument in place at year end hypothetical percent weakening of the dollar relative to all other currency would adversely affect our expected cash flow for our machinery of contentsenergy transportation operation by approximately million last year similar assumption and calculation yielded potential million adverse impact on cash flow we determine our net exposure by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instrument we multiply these net amount by percent to determine the sensitivity since our policy for financial product operation is to hedge the foreign exchange risk when the currency of our debt portfolio doe not match the currency of our receivable portfolio percent change in the value of the dollar relative to all other currency would not have material effect on our consolidated financial position result of operation or cash flow neither our policy the effect of percent change in the value of the dollar ha changed from that reported at the end of last year the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rate ignores the effect this movement may have on other variable including competitive risk if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact the result would probably be different from the sensitivity effect shown above in addition it is unlikely that all currency would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the dollar in reality some currency may weaken while others may strengthen our primary exposure excluding competitive risk is to exchange rate movement in the japanese yen euro chinese yuan british pound and australian dollar interest rate sensitivity for our machinery energy transportation operation we have the option to use interest rate swap to lower the cost of borrowed fund by attaching fixed to floating interest rate swap to fixed rate debt and by entering into forward rate agreement on future debt issuance hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rate along the entire interest rate yield curve would have minimal impact to the pre tax earnings of machinery energy transportation last year similar assumption and calculation yielded minimal impact to pre tax earnings for our financial product operation we use interest rate derivative instrument primarily to meet our match funding objective and strategy we have match funding policy whereby the interest rate profile fixed or floating rate of our debt portfolio is matched to the interest rate profile of our earning asset portfolio finance receivables and operating lease within certain parameter in connection with that policy we use interest rate swap agreement to modify the debt structure match funding assist in maintaining our interest rate spread regardless of the direction interest rate move in order to properly manage sensitivity to change in interest rate financial product measure the potential impact of different interest rate assumption on pre tax earnings all on balance sheet position including derivative financial instrument are included in the analysis the primary assumption included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate asset or liability the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate asset remains unchanged and the level of floating rate asset and debt remain constant an analysis of the december balance sheet using these assumption estimate the impact of basis point immediate and sustained adverse change in interest rate to have potential million adverse impact on pre tax earnings last year similar assumption and calculation yielded potential million adverse impact to pre tax earnings this analysis doe not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement nor doe it consider any action management could undertake in response to change in interest rate accordingly no assurance can be given that actual result would be consistent with the result of our estimate

principle for recognizing actuarial gain and loss and expected return on plan asset for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan prior to actuarial gain and loss were recognized component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and were generally amortized into earnings in future period under the new principle actuarial gain and loss are immediately recognized through net benefit cost upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis triggering event warrant remeasurement in addition we have changed our policy for recognizing the expected return on plan asset from market related value method based on three year smoothing of asset return to fair value method we believe these change are preferable they accelerate the recognition of change in fair value of plan asset and actuarial gain and loss in our consolidated statement of result of operation provide greater transparency of our economic obligation in accounting result and better align with the fair value principle by recognizing the effect of economic and interest rate change on pension and other postretirement benefit asset and liability in the

criterion are satisfied persuasive evidence of sale arrangement exists price is fixed and determinable collectibility is reasonably assured and delivery ha occurred persuasive evidence of an arrangement and fixed or determinable price exist once we receive an order or contract from customer or independently owned and operated dealer we ass collectibility at the time of the sale and if collectibility is not reasonably assured the sale is deferred and not recognized collectibility is probable or payment is received typically where product is produced and sold in the same country title and risk of ownership transfer when the product is shipped product that are exported from country for sale typically pas title and risk of ownership at the border of the destination country sale of certain turbine machinery unit draglines and long wall roof support are recognized under accounting for construction type contract primarily using the percentage of completion method revenue is

loss is probable of contentsour remanufacturing operation are primarily focused on the remanufacture of cat engine and component and rail related product in this business used engine and related component core are inspected cleaned and remanufactured in connection with the sale of most of our remanufactured product we collect deposit from the dealer that is repaid if the dealer return an acceptable core within specified time period caterpillar owns and ha title to the core when they are returned from dealer the rebuilt engine or component the core plus any new content is then sold remanufactured product to dealer and customer revenue is recognized pursuant to the same criterion machinery energy transportation sale noted above title to the entire remanufactured product pass to the dealer upon sale at the time of sale the deposit is recognized in other current liability in statement in addition the core to be returned is recognized an asset in prepaid expense and other current asset in statement at the estimated replacement cost based on historical experience with useable core upon receipt of an acceptable core we repay the deposit and relieve the liability the returned core is then included in inventory in the event that the deposit is forfeited upon failure by the dealer to return an acceptable core in the specified time period we recognize the core deposit and the cost of the core in sale and cost of good sold respectively no right of return exists on sale of equipment replacement part return are estimable and accrued at the time sale is recognized we provide discount to dealer through merchandising program we have numerous program that are designed to promote the sale of our product the most common dealer program provide discount when the dealer sell product to targeted end user the cost of these discount is estimated based on historical experience and known change in merchandising program and is reported reduction to sale when the product sale is recognized our standard dealer invoice term are established by marketing region our invoice term for end user customer sale are established by the responsible business unit when sale is made to dealer the dealer is responsible for payment even if the product is not sold to an end customer dealer and customer must make payment within the established invoice term to avoid potential interest cost interest at or above prevailing market rate may be charged on any past due balance and generally our practice is to not forgive this interest in and term were extended to not more than one year for million million and million of receivables respectively which represent approximately percent of consolidated sale we establish bad debt allowance for machinery energy transportation receivables when it becomes probable that the receivable will not be collected our allowance for bad debt is not significant revenue of financial product are generated primarily from finance revenue on finance receivables and rental payment on operating lease finance revenue is recorded over the life of the related finance receivable using the interest method including the accretion of certain direct origination cost that are deferred revenue from rental payment received on operating lease is recognized on straight line basis over the term of the lease recognition of finance revenue and rental revenue is suspended and the account is placed on non accrual status when management determines that collection of future income is not probable generally after day past due recognition is resumed and previously suspended income is recognized when the account becomes current and collection of remaining amount is considered probable see note for more information sale and revenue are presented net of sale and other related tax inventory inventory are stated at the lower of cost or market cost is principally determined using the last in first lifo method the value of inventory on the lifo basis represented about percent of total inventory at december and if the fifo first in first out method had been in use inventory would have been million and million higher than reported at december and respectively of contentse depreciation and amortization depreciation of plant and equipment is computed principally using accelerated method depreciation on equipment leased to others primarily for financial product is computed using the straight line method over the term of the lease the depreciable basis is the original cost of the equipment le the estimated residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease term in and cat financial depreciation on equipment leased to others wa million million and million respectively and wa included in other operating income expense in statement in and consolidated depreciation expense wa million million and million respectively amortization of purchased finite lived intangible is computed principally using the

currency amount to the functional currency are included in other income expense in statement gain and loss resulting from translating asset and liability from the functional currency to dollar are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in statement derivative financial instrument our earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuation due to change in foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and commodity price our risk management policy policy allows for the use of derivative financial instrument to prudently manage foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and commodity price exposure our policy specifies that derivative are not to be used for speculative purpose derivative that we use are primarily foreign currency forward option and cross currency contract interest rate swap and commodity forward and option contract all derivative are recorded at fair value see note for more information income tax the provision for income tax is determined using the asset and liability approach taking into account guidance related to uncertain tax position tax law require item to be included in tax filing at different time than the item are reflected in the financial statement current liability is recognized for the estimated tax payable for the current year deferred tax represent the future tax consequence expected to occur when the reported amount of asset and liability are recovered or paid deferred tax are adjusted for enacted change in tax rate and tax law valuation allowance are recorded to reduce deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that tax benefit will not be realized goodwill for acquisition accounted for business combination goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net asset acquired we are required to test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and when event or circumstance indicate the fair value of reporting unit may be below it carrying value reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to component to which goodwill is assigned when initially recorded we assign goodwill to reporting unit based on our integration plan and the expected synergy resulting from the acquisition because caterpillar is highly integrated company the business we acquire are sometimes combined with or integrated into existing reporting unit when change occur in the composition of our operating segment or reporting unit goodwill is reassigned to the affected reporting unit based on their relative fair value of contentswe test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever event or circumstance make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred we perform our annual goodwill impairment test of october and monitor for interim triggering event on an ongoing basis goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either qualitative assessment or two step process we have an option to make qualitative assessment of reporting unit goodwill for impairment if we choose to perform qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is necessary for reporting unit where we perform the two step process the first step requires to compare the fair value of each reporting unit which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flow to the respective carrying value which includes goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds it carrying value the goodwill is not considered impaired if the carrying value is higher than the fair value there is an indication that an impairment may exist and the second step is required in step two the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated the excess of the fair value of reporting unit over the fair value assigned to it asset and liability if the implied fair value of goodwill is le than the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill the difference is recognized an impairment loss see note for further detail estimate in financial statement the preparation of financial statement in conformity with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect reported amount the more significant estimate include residual value for leased asset fair value for goodwill impairment test impairment of available for sale security warranty liability stock based compensation and reserve for product liability and insurance loss

other operating income expense in statement at december we changed our method for calculating the service and interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost historically these component were determined utilizing single weighted average discount rate based on yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period beginning in we elected to utilize full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest cost by applying the specific spot rate along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flow we made this change to provide more precise measurement of service and interest cost by improving the correlation between the projected cash flow to the corresponding spot rate along the yield curve under the previous method the discount rate used for the service and interest component of cost would have been percent for pension percent for non pension and percent for opeb this change had no impact on our year end defined benefit pension and opeb obligation or our annual net periodic benefit cost the lower service and interest cost were entirely offset in the actuarial loss gain
