calvert cliff clinton dresden eddystone fairless hill ginna gould street handley mountain creek mystic nine mile point unit peach bottom quad city riverside and salem on october the epa final section rule became effective the rule requires that series of study and analysis be performed to determine the best technology available to minimize adverse impact on aquatic life followed by an implementation period for the selected technology the timing of the various requirement for each facility is related to the status of it current npdes permit and the subsequent renewal period there is no fixed compliance schedule this is left to the discretion of the state permitting director until the compliance requirement are determined by the applicable state permitting director on site specific basis for each plant generation can not estimate the effect that compliance with the rule will have on the operation of it generating facility and it future result of operation cash flow and financial position should state permitting director determine that facility must install cooling tower to comply with the rule that facility economic viability could be called into question however the potential impact of the rule ha been significantly reduced since the final rule doe not mandate cooling tower national standard and set forth technology that are presumptively compliant and the state permitting director is required to apply cost benefit test and can take into consideration site specific factor pursuant to discussion with the njdep in regarding the application of section to oyster creek generation agreed to permanently cease generation operation at oyster creek by december ten year the expiration of it operating license in the agreement only applies to oyster creek based on it unique circumstance and doe not set any precedent for the ultimate compliance requirement for section at exelon other plant new york facility in july the new york department of environmental conservation dec issued policy regarding the best available technology for cooling water intake structure through it policy the dec established closed cycle cooling or it equivalent the performance goal for all existing facility but also provided that the dec will select feasible technology whose cost are not wholly disproportionate to the environmental benefit to be gained and allows for site specific determination where the entrainment performance goal can not be achieved the ginna and nine mile point unit power generation facility received renewal of their state water discharge permit in salem in june the njdep issued renewed npdes permit for salem expiring in july allowing for the continued operation of salem with it existing cooling water system in february pseg filed renewal application with the njdep allowing salem to continue operating under it existing npdes permit until new permit is issued on june njdep issued draft npdes permit for salem the draft permit doe not require installation of cooling tower and allows salem to table of content continue to operate utilizing the existing through cooling water system with certain required system modification on july the njdep issued final permit for salem that not require the installation of cooling tower however the permit is being challenged by an environmental organization and if successful could result in additional cost for clean water act compliance solid and hazardous waste cercla provides for immediate response and removal action coordinated by the epa in the event of threatened release of

science based public policy exelon producer of electricity from predominantly low carbon generating facility such nuclear hydroelectric wind and solar photovoltaic ha relatively small greenhouse gas ghg emission profile or carbon footprint compared to other domestic generator of electricity by virtue of it significant investment in low carbon intensity asset generation emission intensity or rate of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted per unit of electricity generated is among the lowest in the industry exelon doe produce ghg emission primarily at it fossil fuel fired generating plant primarily natural gas methane and nitrous oxide are all emitted in this process with representing the largest portion of these ghg emission ghg emission from combustion of fossil fuel represented the majority of exelon direct ghg emission in although le than percent of it owned generating capacity utilizes fossil fuel with le than percent of owned generation mwh actually produced by fossil fuel exelon fossil fired generation is primarily intermediate and peaking in nature other ghg emission source at exelon include natural gas methane leakage on the natural gas system sulfur hexafluoride leakage in it electric transmission and distribution operation and refrigerant leakage from it chilling and cooling equipment well fossil fuel combustion in it motor vehicle and fossil fuel generation of

management of each registrant regularly meet with the chief enterprise risk officer and the rmc which comprises officer of the registrant to identify and evaluate the most significant risk of the registrant business and the appropriate step to manage and mitigate those risk the chief enterprise risk officer and senior executive of the registrant discus those risk with the finance and risk committee and audit committee of the exelon board of director and the comed peco bge and phi board of director in addition the generation oversight committee of the exelon board of director evaluates risk related to the generation business the risk factor discussed below could adversely affect one or more of the registrant result of operation or cash flow and the market price of their publicly traded security each of the registrant ha disclosed the known material risk that affect it business at this time however there may be further risk and uncertainty that are not presently known or that are not currently believed by registrant to be material that could adversely affect it performance or financial condition in the future table of content exelon financial condition and result of operation are affected to significant degree by generation position predominantly nuclear generator selling power into competitive energy market with concentration in select region and the role of the utility registrant operator of electric transmission and distribution system in six of the largest metropolitan area in the united state factor that affect the financial condition and result of operation of the registrant fall primarily under the following category all of which are discussed in further detail below market and financial factor exelon and generation result of operation are affected by price fluctuation in the energy market power price are function of supply and demand which in turn are driven by factor such the price of fuel in particular the price of natural gas which affect the price that generation can obtain for the output of it power plant the presence of other generation resource in the market in which generation output is sold the demand for electricity in the market where the registrant conduct their business and the impact of on going competition in the retail channel regulatory and legislative factor the regulatory and legislative factor that affect the registrant include change to the law and regulation that govern competitive market and utility cost recovery and environmental policy in particular exelon and generation financial performance could be affected by change in the design of competitive wholesale power market or generation ability to sell power in those market in addition potential regulation and legislation including regulation or legislation regarding climate change and renewable portfolio standard could have significant effect on the registrant also return for the utility registrant are influenced significantly by state regulation and regulatory proceeding operational factor the registrant operational performance is subject to those factor inherent in running the nation largest fleet of nuclear power reactor and large electric and gas distribution system the safe and effective operation of the nuclear facility and the ability to effectively manage the associated decommissioning obligation well the ability to maintain the availability reliability and safety of it energy delivery system are fundamental to exelon ability to protect and grow shareholder value additionally the operating cost of the utility registrant and the opinion of their customer and regulator are affected by those company ability to maintain the reliability and safety of their energy delivery system risk related to the phi merger exelon is subject to additional risk related to the merger with phi that closed on march discussion of each of these risk category and other risk factor is included below market and financial factor generation is exposed to depressed price in the wholesale and retail power market which could negatively affect it result of operation or cash flow exelon and generation generation is exposed to commodity price risk for the unhedged portion of it electricity generation supply portfolio generation earnings and cash flow are therefore subject to variability of spot and forward market price in the market in which it operates rise and fall price of fuel the spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the marginal cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour thus the market price of power is affected by the market price of the marginal fuel used to generate the electricity unit often the next unit of electricity will be supplied from generating station fueled by fossil fuel consequently change in the market price of fossil fuel often result in comparable change to the market price of power for example the use of new technology to recover natural gas from shale deposit ha increased natural gas supply and reserve placing downward pressure on natural gas table of content price and therefore on power price the continued addition of supply from new alternative generation resource such wind and solar whether mandated through rps or otherwise subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation could displace higher marginal cost plant further reducing power price in addition further delay or elimination of epa air quality regulation could prolong the duration for which the cost of pollution from fossil fuel generation is not factored into market price demand and supply the market price for electricity is also affected by change in the demand for electricity and the available supply of electricity unfavorable economic condition milder than normal weather and the growth of energy efficiency and demand response program could each depress demand the result is that higher cost generating resource do not run frequently putting downward pressure on electricity market price the tepid economic environment in recent year and growing energy efficiency and demand response initiative have limited the demand for electricity in generation market in addition in some market the supply of electricity through wind or solar generation when combined with other base load generation such nuclear could often exceed demand during some hour of the day resulting in loss of revenue for base load generating plant increased supply in excess of demand is furthered by the continuation of rps mandate and subsidy for renewable energy retail competition generation retail operation compete for customer in competitive environment which affect the margin that generation can earn and the volume that it is able to serve in period of sustained low natural gas and power price and low market volatility retail competitor can aggressively pursue market share because the barrier to entry can be low and wholesale generator including generation use their retail operation to hedge generation output increased or more aggressive competition could adversely affect overall gross margin and profitability in generation retail operation sustained low market price or depressed demand and over supply could adversely affect exelon and generation result of operation or cash flow and such impact could be emphasized given generation concentration of base load electric generating capacity within primarily two geographic market region namely the midwest and the mid atlantic these impact could adversely affect exelon and generation ability to fund other discretionary us of cash such growth project or to pay dividend in addition such condition may no longer support the continued operation of certain generating facility which could adversely affect exelon and generation result of operation through accelerated depreciation expense impairment charge related to inventory that can not be used at other nuclear unit and cancellation of in flight capital project accelerated amortization of plant specific nuclear fuel cost severance cost accelerated asset retirement obligation expense related to future decommissioning activity and additional funding of decommissioning cost which can be offset in whole or in part by reduced operating and maintenance expense slow recovery in market condition could result in prolonged depression of or further decline in commodity price including low forward natural gas and power price and low market volatility which could also adversely affect exelon and generation result of operation cash flow or financial position see note early nuclear plant retirement of the combined note to consolidated financial statement for additional information in addition to price fluctuation generation is exposed to other risk in the power market that are beyond it control and could negatively affect it result of operation exelon and generation credit risk in the bilateral market generation is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe generation money or are obligated to purchase energy or fuel from generation will not perform under their obligation for operational or financial reason in the event the counterparties to these table of content arrangement fail to perform generation could be forced to purchase or sell energy or fuel in the wholesale market at le favorable price and incur additional loss to the extent of amount if any already paid to the counterparties in the spot market generation is exposed to risk result of default sharing mechanism that exist within certain market primarily rtos and isos the purpose of which is to spread such risk across all market participant generation is also party to agreement with entity in the energy sector that have experienced rating downgrade or other financial difficulty in addition generation retail sale subject it to credit risk through competitive electricity and natural gas supply activity to serve commercial and industrial company governmental entity and residential customer retail credit risk result when customer default on their contractual obligation this risk represents the loss that could be incurred due to the nonpayment of customer account balance well the loss from the resale of energy previously committed to serve the customer market design the wholesale market vary from region to region with distinct rule practice and procedure change in these market rule problem with rule implementation or failure of any of these market could adversely affect generation business in addition significant decrease in market participation could affect market liquidity and have detrimental effect on market stability the registrant are potentially affected by emerging technology that could over time affect or transform the energy industry including technology related to energy generation distribution and consumption all registrant some of these technology include but are not limited to further shale gas development or source cost effective renewable energy technology broad consumer adoption of electric vehicle distributed generation and

distribution system to address changing load demand and could make portion of our electric system power supply and transmission and or distribution facility obsolete prior to the end of their useful life such technology could also result in further decline in commodity price or demand for delivered energy each of these factor could materially affect the registrant result of operation cash flow or financial position through among other thing reduced operating revenue increased operating and maintenance expense and increased capital expenditure well potential asset impairment charge or accelerated depreciation and decommissioning expense over shortened remaining asset useful life market performance and other factor could decrease the value of ndt fund and employee benefit plan asset and could increase the related employee benefit plan obligation which then could require significant additional funding all registrant disruption in the capital market and their actual or perceived effect on particular business and the greater economy could adversely affect the value of the investment held within generation ndts and exelon employee benefit plan trust the registrant have significant obligation in these area and exelon and generation hold substantial asset in these trust to meet those obligation the asset value are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain return which could fall below the registrant projected return rate decline in the market value of the ndt fund investment could increase generation funding requirement to decommission it nuclear plant decline in the market value of the pension and opeb plan asset will increase the funding requirement associated with exelon pension and opeb plan obligation additionally exelon pension and opeb plan liability are sensitive to change in interest rate interest rate decrease the liability increase potentially increasing benefit cost and funding requirement change in demographic including increased number of retirement or change in life expectancy assumption or change to social security or medicare eligibility requirement could also increase the cost and funding requirement of table of content the obligation related to the pension and opeb plan if future increase in pension and other postretirement cost result of reduced plan asset or other factor can not be recovered or can not be recovered in timely manner from the utility registrant customer the result of operation and financial position of the utility registrant could be negatively affected ultimately if the registrant are unable to manage the investment within the ndt fund and benefit plan asset and are unable to manage the related benefit plan liability their result of operation cash flow or financial position could be negatively impacted unstable capital and credit market and increased volatility in commodity market could adversely affect the registrant business in several way including the availability and cost of short term fund for liquidity requirement the registrant ability to meet long term commitment generation ability to hedge effectively it generation portfolio and the competitiveness and liquidity of energy market each could negatively impact the registrant result of operation cash flow or financial position all registrant the registrant rely on the capital market particularly for publicly offered debt well the banking and commercial paper market to meet their financial commitment and short term liquidity need if internal fund are not available from the registrant respective operation disruption in the capital and credit market in the united state or abroad could adversely affect the registrant ability to access the capital market or draw on their respective bank revolving credit facility the registrant access to fund under their credit facility depends on the ability of the bank that are party to the facility to meet their funding commitment those bank may not be able to meet their funding commitment to the registrant if they experience shortage of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volume of borrowing request from the registrant and other borrower within short period of time the inability to access capital market or credit facility and longer term disruption in the capital and credit market result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation reduced alternative or failure of significant financial institution could result in the deferral of discretionary capital expenditure change to generation hedging strategy in order to reduce collateral posting requirement or reduction in dividend payment or other discretionary us of cash in addition the registrant have exposure to worldwide financial market including europe disruption in the european market could reduce or restrict the registrant ability to secure sufficient liquidity or secure liquidity at reasonable term of december approximately or billion of the registrant available credit facility were with european bank the credit facility include billion in aggregate total commitment of which billion wa available of december of december there wa million of borrowing under generation bilateral credit facility see note debt and credit agreement of the combined note to consolidated financial statement for additional information on the credit facility the strength and depth of competition in energy market depend heavily on active participation by multiple trading party which could be adversely affected by disruption in the capital and credit market and legislative and regulatory initiative that could affect participant in commodity transaction reduced capital and liquidity and failure of significant institution that participate in the energy market could diminish the liquidity and competitiveness of energy market that are important to the respective business of the registrant perceived weakness in the competitive strength of the energy market could lead to pressure for greater regulation of those market or attempt to replace market structure with other mechanism for the sale of power including the requirement of long term contract which could have material adverse effect on exelon and generation result of operation or cash flow table of content if any of the registrant were to experience downgrade in it credit rating to below investment grade or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standard in it agreement with it counterparties it would be required to provide significant amount of collateral under it agreement with counterparties and could experience higher borrowing cost all registrant generation business is subject to credit quality standard that could require market participant to post collateral for their obligation if generation were to be downgraded or lose it investment grade credit rating based on it senior unsecured debt rating or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standard of trading counterparties it would be required under it hedging arrangement to provide collateral in the form of letter of credit or cash which could have material adverse effect upon it liquidity the amount of collateral required to be provided by generation at any point in time depends on variety of factor including the notional amount of the applicable hedge the nature of counterparty and related agreement and change in power or other commodity price in addition if generation were downgraded it could experience higher borrowing cost result of the downgrade generation could experience downgrade in it rating if any of the credit rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial risk and overall creditworthiness of the power generation industry in general or generation in particular ha deteriorated change in rating methodology by the credit rating agency could also have negative impact on the rating of generation generation ha project specific financing arrangement and must meet the requirement of various agreement relating to those financing failure to meet those arrangement could give rise to project specific financing default which if not cured or waived could result in the specific project being required to repay the associated debt or other borrowing earlier than otherwise anticipated and if such repayment were not made the lender or security holder would generally have right to foreclose the project asset and related collateral the utility registrant operating agreement with pjm and peco bge and dpl natural gas procurement contract contain collateral provision that are affected by their credit rating and market price if certain wholesale market condition were to exist and the utility registrant were to lose their investment grade credit rating based on their senior unsecured debt rating they would be required to provide collateral in the form of letter of credit or cash which could have material adverse effect upon their liquidity collateral posting requirement will generally increase market price rise and decrease market price fall collateral posting requirement for peco bge and dpl with respect to their natural gas supply contract will generally increase forward market price fall and decrease forward market price rise given the relationship to forward market price contract collateral requirement can be volatile in addition if the utility registrant were downgraded they could experience higher borrowing cost result of the downgrade utility registrant could experience downgrade in it rating if any of the credit rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial risk and overall creditworthiness of the utility industry in general or utility registrant in particular ha deteriorated utility registrant could experience downgrade if it current regulatory environment becomes le predictable by materially lowering return for the utility registrant or adopting other measure to limit utility rate additionally the rating for utility registrant could be downgraded if it financial result are weakened from current level due to weaker operating performance or due to failure to properly manage it capital structure in addition change in rating methodology by the agency could also have negative impact on the rating of the utility registrant the utility registrant conduct their respective business and operate under governance model and other arrangement and procedure intended to assure that the utility registrant are treated separate independent company distinct from exelon and other exelon subsidiary in order to isolate the utility registrant from exelon and other exelon subsidiary in the event of financial difficulty at exelon or another exelon subsidiary these measure commonly referred to ring table of content fencing could help avoid or limit downgrade in the credit rating of the utility registrant in the event of reduction in the credit rating of exelon despite these ring fencing measure the credit rating of the utility registrant could remain linked to some degree to the credit rating of exelon consequently reduction in the credit rating of exelon could result in reduction of the credit rating of some or all of the utility registrant reduction in the credit rating of utility registrant could have material adverse effect on the utility registrant see liquidity and capital resource recent market condition and security rating for further information regarding the potential impact of credit downgrade on the registrant cash flow generation financial performance could be negatively affected by price volatility availability and other risk factor associated with the procurement of nuclear and fossil fuel exelon and generation generation depends on nuclear fuel and fossil fuel to operate most of it generating facility nuclear fuel is obtained predominantly through long term uranium supply contract contracted conversion service contracted enrichment service or combination thereof and contracted fuel fabrication service natural gas and oil are procured for generating plant through annual short term and spot market purchase the supply market for nuclear fuel natural gas and oil are subject to price fluctuation availability restriction and counterparty default that could negatively affect the result of operation or cash flow for generation generation risk management policy can not fully eliminate the risk associated with it commodity trading activity exelon and generation generation asset based power position well it power marketing fuel procurement and other commodity trading activity expose generation to risk of commodity price movement generation attempt to manage this exposure through enforcement of established risk limit and risk management procedure these risk limit and risk management procedure may not work planned and can not eliminate all risk associated with these activity even when it policy and procedure are followed and decision are made based on projection and estimate of future performance result of operation could be diminished if the judgment and assumption underlying those decision prove to be incorrect factor such future price and demand for power and other energy related commodity become more difficult to predict and the calculation become le reliable the further into the future estimate are made result generation can not predict the impact that it commodity trading activity and risk management decision could have on it business operating result cash flow or financial position generation buy and sell energy and other product and enters into financial contract to manage risk and hedge various position in generation power generation portfolio generation is exposed to volatility in financial result for unhedged position financial performance and load requirement could be adversely affected if generation is unable to effectively manage it power portfolio exelon and generation significant

that purpose generation output is sold in the wholesale power market to the extent it power portfolio is not sufficient to meet the requirement of it customer under the related agreement generation must purchase power in the wholesale power market generation financial result could be negatively affected if it is unable to cost effectively meet the load requirement of it customer manage it power portfolio and effectively address the change in the wholesale power market table of content challenge to tax position taken by the registrant well tax law change and the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effect of business decision could negatively impact the registrant result of operation or cash flow all registrant potential corporate tax reform the result of the november election have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to federal tax policy president trump ha stated that one of top priority is comprehensive tax reform and house republican plan to advance their tax reform blueprint tax reform proposal call for reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from the current to low other proposal provide among other item for the immediate deduction of capital investment expenditure and full or partial elimination of debt interest expense deduction it is uncertain whether to what extent or when these or any other change in federal tax policy will be enacted or the transition time frame for such change further for the utility registrant regulator may impose rate reduction to provide the benefit of any income tax expense reduction to customer and refund excess deferred income tax previously collected through rate the amount and timing of any such rate change would be subject to the discretion of the rate regulator in each specific jurisdiction for these reason the registrant can not predict the impact any potential change may have on their future result of operation cash flow or financial position and such change could be material tax reserve the registrant are required to make judgment in order to estimate their obligation to taxing authority these tax obligation include income real estate sale and use and employment

is fully recoverable and carried forward recovery balance in the next gcr filing purchased power and natural gas price fluctuate based on their relevant supply and demand significantly higher rate related to purchased power and natural gas could result in decline in customer usage lower revenue and potentially additional uncollectible account expense for the utility registrant in addition any challenge by the regulator or the utility registrant to the recoverability of these cost could have material effect on the registrant result of operation or cash flow also the utility registrant cash flow could be affected by difference between the time period when electricity and natural gas are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customer further the impact of economic downturn on the utility registrant customer such unemployment for residential customer and le demand for product and service provided by table of content commercial and industrial customer and the related regulatory limitation on residential service termination could result in an increase in the number of uncollectible customer balance which would negatively impact the utility registrant result of operation or cash flow generation customer facing energy delivery activity face similar economic downturn risk such lower volume sold and increased expense for uncollectible customer balance which could negatively affect generation result of operation or cash flow see item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk for further discussion of the registrant credit risk the effect of weather could impact the registrant result of operation or cash flow all registrant weather condition directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodity temperature above normal level in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenue and temperature below normal level in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity

mdpsc and dcpsc approved level per customer regardless of what actual distribution volume are for billing period and are not affected by actual weather with the exception of major storm pursuant to the illinois feja signed into law on december and effective in comed can eliminate the favorable or unfavorable impact of weather or load on it electric distribution revenue by either revising it electric distribution formula rate to eliminate the roe collar beginning with the reconciliation performed for the calendar year or implementing decoupling tariff if the electric distribution formula rate were to be terminated at anytime extreme weather condition or damage resulting from storm could stress the utility registrant transmission and distribution system communication system and technology resulting in increased maintenance and capital cost and limiting each company ability to meet peak customer demand these extreme condition could have detrimental effect on the utility registrant result of operation or cash flow first and third quarter financial result in particular are substantially dependent on weather condition and could make period comparison le relevant generation operation are also affected by weather which affect demand for electricity well operating condition to the extent that weather is warmer in the summer or colder in the winter than assumed generation could require greater resource to meet it contractual commitment extreme weather condition or storm could affect the availability of generation and it transmission limiting generation ability to source or send power to where it is sold in addition drought like condition limiting water usage could impact generation ability to run certain generating asset at full capacity these condition which can not be accurately predicted could have an adverse effect by causing generation to seek additional capacity at time when wholesale market are tight or to seek to sell excess capacity at time when market are weak certain long lived asset and other asset recorded on the registrant statement of financial position could become impaired which would result in write offs of the

experienced event that reduced it creditworthiness or the indemnity arrangement became unenforceable comed or peco could be liable for any existing or future claim which could impact comed or peco result of operation cash flow or financial position regulatory and legislative factor the registrant generation and energy delivery business are highly regulated and could be subject to regulatory and legislative action that adversely affect their operation or financial result fundamental change in regulation or legislation or violation of tariff or market rule and anti manipulation law could disrupt the registrant business plan and adversely affect their operation or financial result all registrant substantially all aspect of the business of the registrant are subject to comprehensive federal or state regulation and legislation further exelon and generation operating result and cash flow are significantly affected by generation sale of power at market based rate opposed to cost based or other similarly regulated rate and exelon and the utility registrant operating result and cash flow are heavily dependent on the ability of the utility registrant to recover their cost for the retail purchase and distribution of power to their customer similarly there is risk that financial market regulation could increase the registrant compliance cost and limit their ability to engage in certain transaction in the planning and management of operation the registrant must address the effect of regulation on their business and change in the regulatory framework including initiative by federal and state legislature rtos exchange ratemaking agency and taxing authority additionally the registrant need to be cognizant and understand rule change or registrant action that could result in potential violation of tariff market rule and anti manipulation law fundamental change in regulation or other adverse legislative action affecting the registrant business would require change in their business planning model and operation and could negatively impact their respective result of operation cash flow or financial position regulatory and legislative development related to climate change and rps could also significantly affect exelon and generation result of operation cash flow or financial position various legislative and regulatory proposal to address climate change through ghg emission reduction if enacted could result in increased cost to entity that generate electricity through carbon emitting fossil fuel which could increase the market price at which all generator in region including generation could sell their output thereby increasing the revenue generation could realize from it low carbon nuclear asset however national regulation or legislation addressing climate change through an rps could also increase the pace of development of wind energy facility in the midwest which could put downward pressure on wholesale market price for electricity from generation midwest nuclear asset partially offsetting any additional value exelon and generation might derive from generation nuclear asset under carbon constrained regulatory regime that might exist in the future similarly final regulation under section of the clean air act may not provide sufficient incentive for state to utilize carbon free nuclear power mean of meeting greenhouse gas emission reduction requirement while continuing policy of favoring renewable energy source current state level climate change and renewable regulation is already providing incentive for regional wind development the registrant can not predict when or whether any of these various legislative and regulatory proposal could become law or what their effect will be on the registrant table of content generation could be negatively affected by possible federal or state legislative or regulatory action that could affect the scope and functioning of the wholesale market exelon and generation federal and state legislative and regulatory body are facing pressure to address consumer concern or are raising concern that energy price in wholesale market are high or insufficient generation is being built because the competitive model is not working and therefore are considering some form of regulation or some other mean of reducing wholesale market price or subsidizing new generation generation is dependent on robust and competitive wholesale energy market to achieve it business objective approximately of generation generating resource which include directly owned asset and capacity obtained through long term contract are located in the area encompassed by pjm generation future result of operation will depend on ferc continued adherence to and support for policy that favor the preservation of competitive wholesale power market such pjm and the absence of material change to market structure that would limit or otherwise negatively affect market competitiveness generation could also be adversely affected by state law regulation or initiative designed to reduce wholesale price artificially below competitive level or to subsidize new generation such the subsequently dismissed new jersey capacity legislation and the mdpsc rfp for new gas fired generation in maryland see note regulatory matter of the combined note to consolidated financial statement for further detail related to the new jersey capacity legislation and the maryland new electric generation requirement in addition ferc application of it order and it subsequent revision could pose risk that generation will have difficulty satisfying ferc test for market based rate since order became final in june generation ha obtained order affirming generation authority to sell at market based rate and none denying that authority the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the act wa enacted in july the part of the act that applies to exelon is title vii which is known the dodd frank wall street transparency and accountability act dodd frank dodd frank requires the creation of new regulatory regime for over the counter swap swap including mandatory clearing for certain category of swap incentive to shift swap activity to exchange trading margin and capital requirement and other obligation designed to promote transparency for non security based swap including commodity swap dodd frank empowers the commodity future trading commission cftc to promulgate regulation implementing the law objective the primary aim of dodd frank is to regulate the key intermediary in the swap market which entity are either swap dealer sd major swap participant msps and certain other financial entity but the law also applies to lesser degree to end user of swap on january president obama signed into law bill that exempts from margin requirement swap used by end user to hedge or mitigate commercial risk moreover the cftc dodd frank regulation preserve the ability of end user in the energy industry to hedge their risk using swap without being subject to mandatory clearing and accepts or exempts end user from many of the other substantive regulation accordingly an end user generation is conducting it commercial business in manner that doe not require registration with the cftc an sd or msp generation doe not anticipate transacting in the future in manner in which it would become sd or msp there are however some rulemaking proceeding that have not yet been finalized including the capital and margin rule for non cleared swap generation doe not expect these rule to directly impact it collateral requirement however depending on the substance of these final rule in addition to certain international regulatory requirement still under development and that are similar to dodd frank generation swap counterparties could be subject to additional and potentially significant table of content capitalization requirement these regulation could motivate the sd and msps to increase collateral requirement or cash posting from their counterparties including generation generation continues to monitor the rulemaking proceeding with respect to the capital and margin rule but can not predict to what extent if any further refinement to dodd frank requirement could impact it cash flow or financial position but such impact could be material the utility registrant could also be subject to some dodd frank requirement to the extent they were to enter into swap however at this time management of the utility registrant continue to expect that their company will not be materially affected by dodd frank generation affiliation with the utility registrant together with the presence of substantial percentage of generation physical asset base within the utility registrant service territory could increase generation cost of business to the extent future complaint or challenge regarding the utility registrant retail rate result in settlement or legislative or regulatory requirement funded in part by generation exelon and generation generation ha significant generating resource within the service area of the utility registrant and make significant sale to each of them those fact tend to cause generation to be directly affected by development in those market government official legislator and advocacy group are aware of generation affiliation with the utility registrant and it sale to each of them in period of rising utility rate particularly when driven by increased cost of energy production and supply those official and advocacy group could question or challenge cost and transaction incurred by the utility registrant with generation irrespective of any previous regulatory process or approval underlying those transaction the prospect of such challenge could increase the time complexity and cost of the associated regulatory proceeding and the occurrence of such challenge could subject generation to level of scrutiny not faced by other unaffiliated competitor in those market in addition government official and legislator could seek way to force generation to contribute to effort to mitigate potential or actual rate increase through measure such generation based tax and contribution to rate relief package the registrant could incur substantial cost to fulfill their obligation related to environmental and other matter all registrant the business which the registrant operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation and legislation by local state and federal authority these law and regulation affect the manner in which the registrant conduct their operation and make capital expenditure including how they handle air and water emission and solid waste disposal violation of these emission and disposal requirement could subject the registrant to enforcement action capital expenditure to bring existing facility into compliance additional operating cost for remediation and clean up cost civil penalty and exposure to third party claim for alleged health or property damage or operating restriction to achieve compliance in addition the registrant are subject to liability under these law for the remediation cost for environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by the registrant and of property contaminated by hazardous substance they generate the registrant have incurred and expect to incur significant cost related to environmental compliance site remediation and clean up remediation activity associated with mgp operation conducted by predecessor company are one component of such cost also the registrant are currently involved in number of proceeding relating to site where hazardous substance have been deposited and could be subject to additional proceeding in the future if application of section of the clean water act which establishes national requirement for reducing the adverse impact to aquatic organism at existing generating station requires the table of content retrofitting of cooling water intake structure at salem or other exelon power plant this development could result in material cost of compliance pursuant to discussion with the njdep regarding the application of section to oyster creek generation agreed to permanently cease generation operation at oyster creek by december ten year before the expiration of it operating license in on july the njdep issued final permit for salem that did not require the installation of cooling tower however the permit is being challenged by an environmental organization and if successful could result in additional cost for clean water act compliance additionally generation is subject to exposure for asbestos related personal injury liability alleged at certain current and formerly owned generation facility future legislative action could require generation to make material contribution to fund to settle lawsuit for alleged asbestos related disease and exposure in some case third party who ha acquired asset from registrant ha assumed the liability the registrant could otherwise have for environmental matter related to the transferred property if the transferee is unable or fails to discharge the assumed liability regulatory authority or injured person could attempt to hold the registrant responsible and the registrant remedy against the transferee could be limited by the financial resource of the transferee see note commitment and contingency of the combined note to consolidated financial statement for additional information change in the utility registrant respective term and condition of service including their respective rate are subject to regulatory approval proceeding and or negotiated settlement that are at time contentious lengthy and subject to appeal which lead to uncertainty to the ultimate result and which could introduce time delay in effectuating rate change exelon and the utility registrant the utility registrant are required to engage in regulatory approval proceeding part of the process of establishing the term and rate for their respective service these proceeding typically involve multiple party including governmental body and official consumer advocacy group and various consumer of energy who have differing concern but who have the common objective of limiting rate increase or even reducing rate the proceeding generally have timeline that may not be limited by statute decision are subject to appeal potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with the approval proceeding the potential duration of such proceeding creates risk that rate ultimately approved by the applicable regulatory body may not be sufficient for utility registrant to recover it cost by the time the rate become effective established rate are also subject to subsequent prudency review by state regulator whereby various portion of rate could be adjusted including recovery mechanism for cost associated with the procurement of electricity or gas bad debt mgp remediation smart grid infrastructure and energy efficiency and demand response program in certain instance the utility registrant could agree to negotiated settlement related to various rate matter customer initiative or franchise agreement these settlement are subject to regulatory approval the utility registrant can not predict the ultimate outcome of any settlement or the action by illinois pennsylvania maryland the district of columbia delaware new jersey or federal regulator in establishing rate including the extent if any to which certain cost such significant capital project will be recovered or what rate of return will be allowed nevertheless the expectation is that the utility registrant will continue to be obligated to deliver electricity to customer in their respective service territory and will also retain significant default service obligation referred to polr dsp so and bgs to provide electricity and natural gas to certain group of customer in their respective service area who do not choose an alternative supplier the ultimate outcome and timing of regulatory table of content rate proceeding have significant effect on the ability of the utility registrant applicable to recover their cost and could have material adverse effect on the utility registrant result of operation cash flow and financial position see note regulatory matter of the combined note to the consolidated financial statement for information regarding rate proceeding federal or additional state rps and or energy conservation legislation along with energy conservation by customer could negatively affect the result of operation or cash flow of generation and the utility registrant all registrant change to current state legislation or the development of federal legislation that requires the use of renewable and alternate fuel source such wind solar biomass and geothermal could significantly impact generation and the utility registrant especially if timely cost recovery is not allowed for utility registrant the impact could include increased cost for recs and purchased power and increased rate for customer federal and state legislation mandating the implementation of energy conservation program that require the implementation of new technology such smart meter and smart grid have increased capital expenditure and could significantly impact the utility registrant if timely cost recovery is not allowed furthermore regulated energy consumption reduction target and decline in customer energy consumption resulting

that could damage or destroy asset or interrupt operation however there can be no assurance that the amount of insurance will be adequate to address such property and casualty loss generation financial performance could be negatively affected by matter arising from it ownership and operation of nuclear facility exelon and generation nuclear capacity factor capacity factor for generating unit particularly capacity factor for nuclear generating unit significantly affect generation result of operation nuclear plant operation involve substantial fixed operating cost but produce electricity at low variable cost due to nuclear fuel cost typically being lower than fossil fuel cost consequently to be successful generation must consistently operate it nuclear facility at high capacity factor lower capacity factor increase generation operating cost by requiring generation to produce additional energy from primarily it fossil facility or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward market in order to satisfy generation obligation to committed third party sale including the utility registrant these source generally have higher cost than generation incurs to produce energy from it nuclear station nuclear refueling outage in general refueling outage are planned to occur once every to month the total number of refueling outage along with their duration could have significant impact on generation result of operation when refueling outage last longer than anticipated or generation experience unplanned outage capacity factor decrease and generation face lower margin due to higher energy replacement cost and or lower energy sale nuclear fuel quality the quality of nuclear fuel utilized by generation could affect the efficiency and cost of generation operation certain of generation nuclear unit have previously had limited number of fuel performance issue remediation action could result in increased cost due to accelerated fuel amortization increased outage cost and or increased cost due to decreased generation capability operational risk operation at any of generation nuclear generation plant could degrade to the point where generation ha to shut down the plant or operate at le than full capacity if this were to happen identifying and correcting the cause could require significant time and expense generation could choose to close plant rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the plant to full capacity in either event generation could lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitment for plant operated but not wholly owned by generation generation could also incur liability to the co owner for plant not operated and not wholly owned by generation from which generation receives portion of the plant output generation result of operation are dependent on the operational performance of the operator and could be adversely affected by significant event at those plant additionally poor operating performance at nuclear plant not owned by generation could result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclear fueled energy which could significantly affect generation result of operation or financial position in addition closure of generating plant owned by others or extended interruption of generating plant or failure of transmission line could affect transmission system that could adversely affect the sale and delivery of electricity in market served by generation nuclear major incident risk although the safety record of nuclear reactor generally ha been good accident and other unforeseen problem have occurred both in the united state and abroad the consequence of major incident could be severe and include loss of life and property damage any resulting liability from nuclear plant major incident within the united state owned or operated by generation or owned by others could exceed generation resource including insurance coverage uninsured loss and other expense to the extent not recovered from insurer or the table of content nuclear industry could be borne by generation and could have material adverse effect on generation result of operation or financial position additionally an accident or other significant event at nuclear plant within the united state or abroad whether owned generation

combined note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information on the impact of the miso announcement exelon is actively participating in this aspect of the proceeding seeking to avoid the implementation of such mopr mechanism however it is too early in the proceeding to predict subsidized generation the rate of expansion of subsidized generation in the market in which generation output is sold can negatively impact wholesale power price and in turn generation result of operation various state have attempted to implement or propose legislation regulation or other policy to subsidize new generation development which may result in artificially depressed wholesale energy and capacity price for example the new jersey legislature enacted into law in january the long term capacity pilot program act lcapp lcapp provides eligible generator with year fixed contract for the sale of capacity in the pjm capacity market under lcapp the local utility in new jersey are required to pay or receive the difference between the price eligible generator receive in the capacity market and the price guaranteed under the year contract new jersey ultimately selected three proposal to participate in lcapp and build new generation in the state in addition on april the mdpsc issued an order directing the maryland electric utility to enter into year contract for difference cfd with cpv maryland llc cpv under which cpv wa required to construct an approximately mw combined cycle gas turbine in waldorf maryland the cfd mandated that utility including bge pepco and dpl pay or receive the difference between cpv contract price and the revenue it receives for capacity and energy from clearing the unit in the pjm capacity market exelon and others challenged the constitutionality and other aspect of the new jersey legislation in federal court the action taken by the mdpsc were also challenged in federal court in an action to which exelon wa not party the federal trial court in both the new jersey and maryland action effectively invalidated the action taken by the new jersey legislature and the mdpsc respectively each of those decision wa upheld by the court of appeal for the third circuit and the court of appeal for the fourth circuit respectively on april the supreme court affirmed the decision of the court of appeal for the fourth circuit and subsequently denied certiorari with respect to the appeal from the court of appeal for the third circuit leaving in place that court decision the matter is now considered closed required under their contract generator developer who were selected in the new jersey and maryland program including cpv offered and cleared in pjm capacity market auction to the extent that the state required customer subsidy are included under their respective contract exelon belief that these project may have artificially suppressed capacity price in pjm in these auction and may continue to do so in future auction to the detriment of exelon while the court decision are positive development continuation of these state effort if successful and unabated by an effective minimum offer price rule mopr for future capacity auction could continue to result in artificially depressed wholesale capacity and or energy price other state could seek to establish program which could substantially impact exelon position and could have significant effect on exelon financial result of operation financial position and cash flow one such state is ohio where state regulated utility company firstenergy ohio fe and aep ohio aep initiated action at the public utility commission of ohio puco to obtain approval for rider that would effectively allow these two company to pas through to all customer in their service territory the difference between their cost and market revenue on ppas entered into table of content between the utility and it merchant generation affiliate for what wa collectively more than of primarily coal fired generation thus the rider were similar to the cfds described above except that the ppa rider in ohio would apply to existing generation facility whereas the cfds applied to new generation facility while ferc order on april largely alleviated the concern related to the rider by holding that the ppas ran afoul of affiliate restriction on fe and aep we continue to closely monitor development in ohio in addition exelon continues to monitor development in maryland new jersey and other state and participates in stakeholder and other process to ensure that similar state subsidy are not developed exelon remains active in advocating for competitive market while opposing policy that require taxpayer and or consumer to subsidize or give preferential treatment to generation provider or technology that do not provide superior reliability or environmental benefit or that would threaten the reliability and value of the integrated electricity grid complaint at ferc seeking to mitigate illinois and new york program providing zecs pjm and nyiso capacity market include minimum offer price rule mopr that is intended to preclude buyer from exercising buyer market power if resource is subjected to mopr it offer is adjusted to remove the revenue it receives through federal state or other government provided financial support program resulting in higher offer that may not clear the capacity market currently the moprs in pjm and nyiso apply only to certain new resource exelon ha generally opposed policy that required subsidy or give preferential treatment to generation provider or technology that do not provide superior reliability or environmental benefit or that would threaten the reliability and value of the integrated electricity grid thus exelon ha supported mopr mean of minimizing the detrimental impact of certain subsidized resource could have on capacity market such the new jersey lcapp and maryland cfd program however in exelon view moprs should not be applied to resource that receive compensation for providing superior reliability or environmental benefit on january the electric power supply association epsa filed two request with ferc one seeking to amend prior complaint against pjm and another seeking expedited action on pending nyiso compliance filing in an existing proceeding both filing allege that the relevant mopr should be expanded to also apply to existing resource receiving zec compensation under the new york ce and illinois program exelon ha filed protest at ferc in response to each filing arguing generally that zec payment provide compensation for an environmental attribute that is distinct from the energy and capacity sold in the ferc jurisdictional market and therefore are no different than other renewable support program like the ptc and rps that have generally not been subject to mopr however if successful an expanded mopr could result in mitigation of generation quad city ginna and nine mile point facility which are expected to receive zec compensation such that they would have an increased risk of not clearing in future capacity auction and thus no longer receiving capacity revenue during the respective zec program this would also impact the fitzpatrick facility that generation is currently in the process of acquiring from entergy any mitigation of these generating resource could have material effect on exelon and generation future cash flow and result of operation the timing of ferc decision with respect to both proceeding is currently unknown

evaluated an alternative approach for managing spent fuel between the date of plant cessation of operation and the fuel acceptance for disposal by the doe this new approach the shortened safstor approach provides for increased usage of dry cask storage for the spent fuel and is now considered one of the decommissioning approach in determining the aro follows decon method of decommissioning shortly after the cessation of operation in which the equipment structure and portion of facility and site containing radioactive contaminant are removed and safely buried in llrw landfill or decontaminated to level that permit property to be released for unrestricted use spent fuel is transferred to dry cask storage soon possible until doe acceptance for disposal delayed decon similar to the decon scenario but with delay to allow for spent fuel to be removed from the site prior to onset of decommissioning activity spent fuel is retained in existing location either wet or dry storage until doe acceptance for disposal shortened safstor similar to the decon scenario but with generally year delay prior to onset of decommissioning activity spent fuel is transferred to dry cask storage soon possible until doe acceptance for disposal safstor method of decommissioning in which the nuclear facility is placed and maintained in such condition that the nuclear facility can be safely stored and subsequently decontaminated to level that permit release for unrestricted use generally within year after cessation of operation spent fuel is transferred to dry cask storage soon possible until doe acceptance for disposal the actual decommissioning approach selected once nuclear facility is shutdown will be determined by generation at the time of shutdown and may be influenced by

assumption described above increase in the aro result of upward revision in estimated undiscounted cash flow are considered new obligation and are measured using current carfr the increase creates new cost layer within the aro any decrease in the estimated undiscounted future cash flow relating to the aro are treated modification of an existing aro cost layer and therefore is measured using the

under the applicable authoritative guidance determining whether or not contract qualifies derivative under this guidance requires that management exercise significant judgment including assessing market liquidity well determining whether contract ha one or more underlyings and one or more notional amount change in management assessment of contract and the liquidity of their market and change in authoritative guidance related to derivative could result in previously excluded contract being subject to the provision of the authoritative derivative guidance generation ha determined that contract to purchase uranium contract to purchase and sell capacity in certain iso certain emission product and recs do not meet the definition of derivative under the current authoritative guidance since they do not provide for net settlement and neither the uranium certain capacity emission nor the rec market are sufficiently liquid to conclude that physical forward contract are readily convertible to cash if these market do become sufficiently liquid in the future and generation would be required to account for these contract derivative instrument the fair value of these contract would be accounted for consistent with generation other derivative instrument in this case if market price differ from the underlying price of the contract generation would be required to record mark to market gain or loss which may have significant impact to exelon and generation financial position and result of operation under current authoritative guidance all derivative are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value except for certain derivative that qualify for and are elected under the normal purchase and normal sale exception further derivative that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting are classified fair value or cash flow hedge for fair value hedge change in fair value for both the derivative and the underlying hedged exposure are recognized in earnings each period for cash flow hedge the portion of the derivative gain or loss that is effective in offsetting the change in the hedged cash flow of the underlying exposure is deferred in accumulated oci and later reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction occurs gain and loss from the ineffective portion of any hedge are recognized in earnings immediately generally hedge accounting is not elected for commodity transaction economic hedge for commodity are recorded at fair value through earnings in addition for energy related derivative entered into for proprietary trading purpose change in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in earnings each period for economic hedge that are not designated for hedge accounting for the utility registrant change in the fair value each

economic hedge on regular basis to determine if they continue to be within the guideline of the rmp part of accounting for derivative the registrant make estimate and assumption concerning future commodity price load requirement interest rate the timing of future transaction and their probable cash flow the fair value of contract and the expected change in the fair value in deciding whether or not to enter into derivative transaction and in determining the initial accounting treatment for derivative transaction in accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurement the registrant categorize these derivative under fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the input to valuation technique used to measure fair value derivative contract are traded in both exchange based and non exchange based market exchange based derivative that are valued using unadjusted quoted price in active market are categorized in level in the fair value hierarchy certain derivative pricing is verified using indicative price quotation available through broker or over the counter on line exchange are categorized in level these price quotation reflect the average of the bid ask mid point price and are obtained from source that the registrant believe provide the most liquid market for the commodity the price quotation are reviewed and corroborated to ensure the price are observable and representative of an orderly transaction between market participant this includes consideration of actual transaction volume market delivery point bid ask spread and contract duration the registrant derivative are traded predominately at liquid trading point the remaining derivative contract are valued using model that take into account input such contract term including maturity and market parameter and assumption of the future price of energy interest rate volatility credit worthiness and credit spread for derivative that trade in liquid market such generic forward swap and option the model input are generally observable such instrument are categorized in level for derivative that trade in le liquid market with limited pricing information the model input generally would include both observable and unobservable input in instance where observable data is unavailable consideration is given to the assumption that market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability this includes assumption about market risk such liquidity volatility and contract duration such instrument are categorized in level the model input generally are not observable the registrant consider nonperformance risk including credit risk in the valuation of derivative contract categorized in level and including both historical and current market data in it assessment of nonperformance risk including credit risk the impact of credit and nonperformance risk to date have generally not been material to the financial statement interest rate and foreign exchange derivative instrument the registrant may utilize fixed to floating interest rate swap which are typically designated fair value hedge mean to achieve the targeted level of variable rate debt percent of total debt additionally the registrant may use forward starting interest rate swap and treasury rate lock to lock in interest rate level in anticipation of future financing and floating to fixed swap for project financing in addition generation enters into interest rate derivative contract to economically hedge risk associated with the interest rate component of commodity position the characterization of the interest rate derivative contract between the economic hedge and proprietary trading activity is driven by the corresponding characterization of the underlying commodity position that give rise to the interest rate exposure generation doe not utilize interest rate derivative with the objective of benefiting from shift or change in market interest rate to manage foreign exchange rate exposure table of content associated with international energy purchase in currency other than dollar generation utilizes foreign currency derivative which are typically designated economic hedge the fair value of the agreement is calculated by discounting the future net cash flow to the present value based on the term and condition of the agreement and the forward interest rate and foreign exchange curve these input are based on observable data and valuation of similar instrument the interest rate and foreign exchange derivative are primarily categorized in level in the fair value hierarchy certain exchange based interest rate derivative that are valued using unadjusted quoted price in active market are categorized in level in the fair value hierarchy see item quantitative and qualitative disclosure

tax position using benefit recognition model with two step approach including more likely than not recognition threshold and measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement if it is not more likely than not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on it technical merit no benefit is recorded uncertain tax position that relate only to timing of when an item is included on tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merit and fact and circumstance of the position assuming the position will be examined by taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required

usage measured by generation or gas throughput volume customer usage by class loss of energy during delivery to customer and applicable customer rate increase or decrease in volume delivered to the utility customer and favorable or unfavorable rate mix due to change in usage pattern in customer class in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue in addition revenue may fluctuate monthly result of customer electing to use an alternate supplier since unbilled commodity receivables are not recorded for these customer change in the timing of meter reading schedule

consolidated financial statement for further discussion of the registrant debt and credit agreement nrc minimum funding requirement nrc regulation require that licensee of nuclear generating facility demonstrate reasonable assurance that sufficient fund will be available in certain minimum amount to decommission the facility these nrc minimum funding level are based upon the assumption that decommissioning activity will commence after the end of the current licensed life of each unit if unit fails the nrc minimum funding test then the plant owner or parent company would be required to take step such providing financial guarantee through letter of credit or parent company guarantee or table of content making additional cash contribution to the ndt fund to ensure sufficient fund are available see note asset retirement obligation to the combined note to consolidated financial statement for additional information on the nrc minimum funding requirement if nuclear plant were to early retire there is risk that it will no longer meet the nrc minimum funding requirement due to the earlier commencement of decommissioning activity and shorter time period over which the ndt fund investment could appreciate in value shortfall could require exelon to post parental guarantee for generation share of the obligation however the amount of any required guarantee will ultimately depend on the decommissioning approach adopted at each site the associated level of cost and the decommissioning trust fund investment performance going forward within two year after shutting down plant generation must submit post shutdown decommissioning activity report psdar to the nrc that includes the planned option for decommissioning the site when generation file it biennial decommissioning funding status report with the nrc on march compared to previous estimate prior to the reversal of the early retirement decision it is currently estimated that given the later commencement of decommissioning activity and longer time period over which the ndt fund investment can appreciate in value quad city will meet the nrc minimum funding requirement it is currently estimated that clinton will fall below the nrc minimum funding requirement by only small amount of december tmi pass the nrc minimum funding test based on it current license life however in the event of an early retirement of tmi the most costly estimate could require parental guarantee of up to million upon issuance of any required financial guarantee each site would be able to utilize the respective ndt fund for radiological decommissioning cost which represent the majority of the total expected decommissioning cost however the nrc must approve an additional exemption in order for the plant owner to utilize the ndt fund to pay for non radiological decommissioning cost spent fuel management and site restoration cost if unit doe not receive this exemption the cost would be borne by the owner while the ultimate amount may vary greatly and could be reduced by alternate decommissioning scenario and or reimbursement of certain cost under the united state department of energy reimbursement agreement or future litigation across the three alternative decommissioning approach available if an early retirement decision is made and tmi were to fail the exemption test generation could incur spent fuel management and site restoration cost over the next ten year of up to million net of tax cash flow from operating activity general generation cash flow from operating activity

effective for annual reporting period beginning on or after december with the option to early adopt the standard for annual period beginning on or after december the registrant do not plan to early adopt the standard the new standard replaces existing guidance on revenue recognition including most industry specific guidance with five step model for recognizing and measuring revenue from contract with customer the objective of the new standard is to provide single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contract with customer to improve comparability within industry across industry and across capital market the underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of good or service to customer at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those good or service the guidance also requires number of disclosure regarding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and the related cash flow in addition the registrant will be required to capitalize cost to acquire new contract and amortize such cost in manner consistent with the transfer to the customer of the associated good or service exelon currently expense those cost incurred the guidance can be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented full retrospective method or retrospectively with cumulative effect adjustment to retained

requirement while there continues to be some ongoing activity in all of these area the registrant have substantially completed the evaluation of their collective contract and revenue stream well the evaluation of the transition method based on the work completed thus far the registrant have reached the following preliminary conclusion the registrant expect to apply the new guidance using the full retrospective method however this conclusion could change based on the outcome of open implementation issue discussed below the registrant currently anticipate that the implementation of the new guidance will not have material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognition and the registrant expect the new guidance will result in more detailed disclosure of revenue compared to current guidance table of content combined note to consolidated financial statement continued dollar in million except per share data unless otherwise noted notwithstanding the preliminary conclusion noted above certain implementation issue continue to be debated and worked through the industry task force process that could result in amendment to the standard or implementation guidance that could have material impact on the registrant consolidated balance sheet consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income consolidated statement of cash flow and disclosure the open implementation issue that could be most impactful to the registrant include the ability of the utility registrant to recognize revenue for certain contract where collectability is in question the accounting by the utility registrant for contribution in aid of construction ciac and whether ciac arrangement are within the scope of the revenue guidance and primarily at generation bundled sale contract and contract with pricing provision that may require recognition of revenue at price other than the contract price straight line or estimated future market price part of the overall implementation project the

about leasing arrangement the guidance requires lessee to recognize both the right of use asset and lease liability in the balance sheet for most lease whereas today only financing type lease

asset or acquisition of business if substantially all the fair value of the asset acquired is concentrated in single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable asset the set of transferred asset and activity is not business if the fair value of the asset acquired is not concentrated in single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable asset then an entity must evaluate whether an input and substantive process exist which together significantly contribute to the ability to produce output the standard also revise the definition of output to focus on good and service to customer the standard could result in more acquisition being accounted for asset acquisition the standard will be effective january and will be applied prospectively intra entity transfer of asset other than inventory issued october requires entity to recognize the income tax consequence of an intra entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs compared to current gaap which prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income tax for an intra entity asset transfer until the asset ha been sold to an outside party the standard is effective for fiscal year

participant would use in pricing asset or liability well assumption about the risk inherent in the input to the valuation technique the input and factor include forward commodity price commodity price volatility contractual volume delivery location interest rate credit quality of counterparties and credit enhancement for commodity derivative the primary input to the valuation model is the forward commodity price curve for each instrument forward commodity price curve are derived by risk management for liquid location and by the trader and portfolio manager for illiquid location all location are reviewed and verified by risk management considering published exchange transaction price executed bilateral transaction broker quote and other observable or public data source the relevant forward commodity curve used to value each of the derivative depends on number of factor including commodity type delivery location and delivery period price volatility varies by commodity and location when appropriate generation discount future cash flow using risk free interest rate with adjustment to reflect the credit quality of each counterparty for asset and generation own credit quality for liability the level of observability of forward commodity price varies generally due to the delivery location and delivery period certain delivery location including pjm west hub for power and henry hub for natural gas are more liquid and price are observable for up to three year in the future the observability period of volatility is generally shorter than the underlying power curve used in option valuation the forward curve for le liquid location is estimated by using the forward curve from the liquid location and applying spread to represent the cost to transport the commodity to the delivery location this spread doe not typically represent majority of the instrument market price result the change in fair value is closely tied to liquid table of content combined note to

change in the spread is generally immaterial an average spread calculated across all level power and gas delivery location is approximately and for power and natural gas respectively many of the

develop reasonable estimate of the potential incremental cost it is reasonably possible however that resolution of this matter could have material unfavorable impact on generation and exelon future result of operation and cash flow finally one of the other prp the landfill owner and operator of the adjacent landfill ha indicated that it will be making contribution claim against cotter for cost that it ha incurred to prevent the subsurface fire from spreading to those area of the west lake landfill where radiological material are believed to have been disposed at this time generation and exelon do not posse sufficient information to ass this claim and are therefore unable to determine the impact on their future result of operation and cash flow on february the senate passed bill to

range of clean up option in the first quarter of although the investigation and option provided to the epa are still subject to epa review and selection of remedy the range of estimated clean up cost to be allocated among all of the prps is in the range of million to million on september epa issued the record of decision identifying it preferred remedial alternative for the site the estimated cost for the alternative chosen by epa is consistent with the prps estimated range of cost noted above based on generation preliminary review it appears probable that generation ha liability and ha

certain portion of the acre riverside property owned by bge the site consists of several different parcel with different current and historical us the sampling included soil and groundwater sample for

that bge conduct an investigation which included site wide investigation of soil sediment groundwater and surface water to complement the mde sampling the field investigation wa completed in january and final report wa provided to mde on june on november mde provided bge with it comment and recommendation on the report which require bge to conduct further investigation and sampling at the site to better delineate the nature and extent of historic contamination including off site sediment and soil sampling mde did not request any interim remediation at this time and bge anticipates completing

river portion of the site wa formerly the location of pepco energy service electric generating facility that generating facility wa deactivated in june and plant structure demolition wa completed in july the remaining portion of the site consists of pepco transmission and distribution service center that remains in operation in december the district court for the district of columbia approved consent decree entered into by pepco and pepco energy service with the doee which requires pepco and pepco energy service to conduct ri for the benning road site and an approximately to acre portion of the adjacent anacostia river the ri will form the basis for the remedial action for the benning road site and for the anacostia river sediment associated with the site the consent decree doe not obligate pepco or pepco energy service to pay for or perform any remediation work but it is anticipated that doee will look to pepco and pepco energy service to assume responsibility for cleanup of any condition in the river that are determined to be attributable to past activity at the benning road site the initial ri field work began in january and wa completed in december in april pepco and pepco energy service submitted draft ri report to doee after review doee determined that additional field investigation and data analysis wa required to complete the ri process much of which wa beyond the scope of the original doee approved ri work plan in the meantime pepco and pepco energy service revised the draft ri report to address doee comment and doee released the draft ri report for public review in february once the additional ri work ha been completed pepco and pepco energy service will issue draft final ri report for review and comment by doee and the public pepco and pepco energy

result of the river sampling performed by pepco and pepco energy service part of the benning ri well similar sampling effort conducted by owner of other site adjacent to this segment of the river and supplemental river sampling conducted by doee contractor doee asked pepco along with party responsible for other site along the river to participate in consultative working group to provide input into the process for future remedial action addressing the entire tidal reach of the river and to ensure proper coordination with the other river cleanup effort currently underway including cleanup of the river segment adjacent to the benning road site resulting from the benning road ri pepco responded that it will participate in the consultative working group but it participation is not an acceptance of any financial responsibility beyond the work that will be performed at the benning road site described above doee ha advised the consultative working group that the federal and doee authority are conducting phase of remedial investigation doee ha targeted june the date for remedy selection for clean up of sediment in this section of the river the consultative working group and the other possible prps have provided input into the proposed clean up process and schedule at this time it is not possible to predict the extent of pepco participation in the river wide ri process and pepco can not estimate the reasonably possible range of loss for response cost beyond those associated with the benning ri component of the river wide initiative it is possible however that resolution of
