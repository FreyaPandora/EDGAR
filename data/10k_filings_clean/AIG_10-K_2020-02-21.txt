country the fsb itself is not regulator but is focused primarily on promoting international financial stability it doe so by coordinating the work of national financial authority and international standard setting body well developing and promoting the implementation of regulatory supervisory and other financial policy the fsb ha issued series of framework and recommendation to address such issue systemic financial risk financial group supervision capital and solvency standard corporate governance including compensation and number of related issue associated with response to the financial crisis the iais represents insurance regulator and supervisor of more than jurisdiction including region and state in nearly country and seek to promote globally consistent insurance industry supervision the iais itself is not regulator but one of it activity is to develop insurance regulatory standard for use by local authority across the globe the fsb ha charged the iais with developing framework for measuring and mitigating systemic risk posed by the insurance sector and the iais ha developed standard relative to many of the area of focus of the fsb which go beyond the iais basic insurance core principle the iais ha adopted comframe common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance group iaigs comframe set out qualitative and quantitative standard tailored to the international activity and size of iaigs these standard assist supervisor in collectively addressing an iaig activity and risk identifying and avoiding supervisory gap and coordinating supervisory activity particularly between the group wide supervisor and other involved supervisor comframe provides standard for group supervision governance and internal control enterprise risk management and recovery and resolution planning part of comframe the iais is developing risk based global insurance capital standard ic applicable to iaigs with the purpose of creating common language for supervisory discussion of group solvency of iaigs we currently meet the criterion set forth to identify an iaig aig form table of content item business the iais ha adopted ic version for five year monitoring phase an initial phase commencing january during which ic version will be used for confidential reporting to group wide supervisor and discussion in supervisory college but will not trigger supervisory action the purpose of the monitoring period is to monitor the performance of the ic over period of time and not to ass the capital adequacy of iaigs during the monitoring period the iais will collect and consider feedback from supervisor stakeholder engagement public consultation and the result of an economic impact assessment all of which could result in change to ic version at the conclusion of the five year monitoring period the iais ha agreed to second phase of implementation whereby the ic will be applied group wide prescribed capital requirement defined solvency control level above which the supervisor doe not intervene on capital adequacy ground confidential reporting of ic version will include reporting by iaigs of reference ic consolidated group wide measure based on standard method for determining capital requirement and market adjusted valuation of asset and liability in recognition that the united state and other interested jurisdiction are developing an aggregation method to group capital calculation the iais is aiding in the development of the am including the collection of data from interested jurisdiction although the am is not part of ic version the iais aim to be in position by the end of the monitoring phase to ass whether the am provides substantially the same outcome the ic in which case it will be considered an outcome equivalent approach to the ic the iais ha begun work on developing criterion to ass whether the am provides comparable outcome to the ic including project plan focused on delivery by the end of the monitoring period the iais ha adopted holistic framework for the assessment and mitigation of systemic risk in the insurance sector for implementation from the beginning of the holistic framework recognizes that systemic risk can emanate from specific activity and exposure arising from either sector wide trend or concentration in individual insurer the holistic framework consists of an enhanced set of supervisory policy measure for macroprudential purpose including supervisory requirement applied to insurer targeting liquidity risk macroeconomic exposure and counterparty exposure enhanced macroprudential supervision crisis management and planning and supervisory power of intervention an annual iais global monitoring exercise to ass trend and to detect the potential build up of systemic risk including an assessment of the possible concentration of systemic risk at individual insurer mechanism for collective iais discussion and assessment including coordinated supervisory response when needed and an iais assessment of the consistency of implementation across jurisdiction in light of the iais adoption of the holistic framework the fsb ha decided to continue of the beginning of it suspension of the identification of global systemically important insurer sii in november based on the initial year of implementation of the holistic framework the fsb will review the need to either discontinue or re establish an annual identification of siis the standard issued by the fsb and or the iais are not binding on the united state or other jurisdiction around the world unless and until the appropriate local governmental body or regulator adopt law and regulation implementing such standard at this time these standard have been adopted only recently and in some case remain under development it is not known how the iais framework and or standard might be implemented in the united state and other jurisdiction around the world or how they might ultimately apply to brexit on june the uk held referendum in which majority voted for the uk to withdraw it membership in the eu commonly referred to brexit the uk left the eu on january under the negotiated withdrawal agreement there is an month transition period during which eu rule will continue to apply in the uk and negotiation will continue to determine the future relationship between the uk and eu aig ha significant operation and employee in the uk and other eu member state prior to december our general insurance business operated through aig europe limited ael uk incorporated insurer with branch across the eea these branch operated through the eu concept of freedom of establishment which allows an insurer in any member state to establish branch operation in any other member state but with single capital pool and single prudential regulator which in this case wa the uk prudential regulation authority ael wa uk authorized in addition the various establishment of ael were able to sell insurance product across border into other member state under the eu principle of freedom of service in the event that the uk left the eu without withdrawal agreement in place or in the event that an eventual agreement not preserve access to these eu freedom for uk insurer ael would have been severely constrained in it ability to utilize and benefit from such freedom uk government policy ha not been to pursue continued uk membership of the eu single market and so it is unlikely that ael structure would have remained efficient beyond the transitional period aig form ktable of content item business result in order to adapt to and be prepared ahead of brexit on december we completed reorganization of our operation and legal entity structure in the uk and the eu through the establishment of new european subsidiary in luxembourg aig europe aesa which ha branch across the eea and switzerland and new uk subsidiary aig uk business written by ael branch in the remaining eea country wa transferred to aesa along with business previously written on freedom of service basis from ael uk operation the remaining business written by ael uk operation wa transferred to aig uk and ael wa merged into aesa allowing aig to operate in both the eea and uk on standalone basis this reorganization address the uncertainty for uk insurer generated by brexit because it ensures that even in the event that no agreement is reached between the uk and eu in this sector aig will be able to continue to service and pay claim on existing policy and write new and renewal business where the insured risk is located in the remaining eea country aig continues to monitor adapt to and prepare for other risk that may arise if the uk and eu are unable to agree provision governing relevant aspect of their future relationship during the transition period including for example the effect on the wider uk and eu economy and on investment legislative change update to policy wording that may become necessary and through to other specific area such the issuance of additional documentation to motorist it insures who travel cross border derivative regulation of and restriction on derivative

item risk factor investing in aig involves risk in deciding whether to invest in aig you should carefully consider the following risk factor any of these risk factor could have significant or material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition or liquidity they could also cause significant fluctuation and volatility in the trading price of our security reader should not consider any description of these factor to be complete set of all potential risk that could affect aig these factor should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and the other report and material filed by with the sec further many of these risk are interrelated and could occur under similar business and economic condition and the occurrence of certain of them may in turn cause the emergence or exacerbate the effect of others such combination could materially increase the severity of the impact of these risk on our business result of operation financial condition and liquidity above and beyond risk singular impact market conditionsdeterioration of economic condition geopolitical tension or weakening in global capital market may materially affect our business result of operation financial condition and liquidity our business are highly dependent on global economic and market condition weakness in economic condition and the capital market or market volatility have in the past led and may in the future lead to among other consequence poor operating environment erosion of consumer and investor confidence reduced business volume deteriorating liquidity and decline in asset valuation adverse economic condition may result from global economic and political development including plateauing business activity and inflationary pressure in developed economy uncertainty surrounding china ability to successfully maintain growth well ongoing trade dispute between the and china the effect of brexit defined below on business investment hiring migration and labor supply and intensifying trade protectionism including through tariff subsidy and other government action these and other market economic and political factor could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and liquidity in many way including lower level of consumer and commercial business activity that could decrease revenue and profitability and decrease value in goodwill deferred tax asset and other long term asset ii widening of credit spread and higher than expected default that could reduce investment asset valuation increase credit loss across numerous asset class and increase statutory capital requirement iii increased market volatility and uncertainty that could decrease liquidity and increase borrowing cost and iv disruption to our business operation in country experiencing geopolitical tension well increased cost associated with meeting customer need in such region other way in which we have in the past been and could in the future be negatively affected by economic condition include but are not limited to increase in policy surrender and cancellation write offs of deferred policy acquisition cost increase in liability for future policy benefit due to loss recognition on certain long duration insurance and reinsurance contract and increase in expense associated with third party reinsurance or decreased ability to obtain reinsurance at acceptable term sustained low declining or negative interest rate or rapidly increasing interest rate may materially and adversely affect our profitability interest rate have been declining globally including in the united state sustained low interest rate can negatively affect the performance of our investment and reduce the level of investment income earned on our investment portfolio we experience lower investment income well accept lower sale of new life and retirement insurance product and police when low or declining interest rate environment persists and or interest rate turn or in certain circumstance remain negative across various global economy due to practical and capital market limitation we may not be able to fully mitigate our interest rate risk by matching exposure of our asset relative to our liability continued low level of interest rate could also impair our ability to earn the return assumed in the pricing and the reserving for our product at the time they were sold and issued in addition change in interest rate may be correlated with inflation trend which would impact our loss trend on the other hand in period of rapidly increasing interest rate we may not be able to replace in timely manner the investment in our general account with higher yielding investment needed to fund the higher crediting rate necessary to keep interest rate sensitive product competitive therefore we may have to accept lower investment spread and thus lower profitability or face decline in sale and greater loss of existing contract and related asset in addition policy loan surrender and withdrawal tend to increase policyholder seek investment with higher perceived return interest rate rise this process may result in significant cash outflow requiring that we sell investment at time when the price of those investment are adversely affected by the increase in interest rate which could result in realized investment loss an increase in interest rate could also have material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio for example by decreasing the estimated fair value of the fixed income security that constitute substantial portion of our investment portfolio this in turn could adversely affect our ability to realize our deferred tax asset aig form ktable of content item risk factor reserve and exposuresthe amount and timing of insurance and reinsurance liability claim are difficult to predict and such claim may exceed the related reserve established for loss and loss expense we regularly review the adequacy of the established loss reserve and conduct extensive analysis of our reserve during the year our loss reserve however may develop adversely and materially impact our business result of operation financial condition and liquidity for general insurance estimation of ultimate net loss loss expense and loss reserve is complex process particularly for long tail liability line of business these line include but are not limited to general liability commercial automobile liability environmental worker compensation excess casualty and crisis management coverage insurance and risk management program for large corporate customer and other customized structured insurance product well excess and umbrella liability error and omission product liability program and specialty there is also greater uncertainty in establishing reserve with respect to new business particularly new business that is generated with respect to more recently introduced product line in these case there is le historical experience or knowledge and le data upon which the actuary can rely estimating reserve is further complicated by unexpected claim or unintended coverage that emerge due to changing condition these emerging issue may increase the size or number of claim beyond our underwriting intent and may not become apparent for many year after policy is issued while we use number of analytical reserve development technique to project future loss development reserve have been and may continue to be significantly affected by change in loss cost trend or loss development factor that were relied upon in setting the reserve for example in and we recorded net adverse prior year development of million and million respectively in adjusted pre tax income loss to strengthen our general insurance loss reserve reflecting adverse development in class of business with long reporting tail primarily in casualty and financial line whereas in we recorded favorable net development of million including million in worker compensation these change in loss cost trend or loss development factor could be due to change in actual versus expected claim and loss difficulty in predicting change such change in inflation unemployment duration or other social or economic factor affecting claim including judicial and legislative approach and change in the tort environment any deviation in loss cost trend or in loss development factor might not be identified for an extended period of time after we record the initial loss reserve estimate for any accident year or number of year for life and retirement experience may develop adversely such that additional reserve must be established adverse experience could arise out of severe short term event such pandemic or change to policyholder behavior during stressed economic period or due to misestimation of long term assumption such mortality mortality improvement interest rate and fixed expense assumption while mortality approximation are relatively stable due to the large amount of historical data available assumption in respect of other variable such policyholder behavior can be more difficult to estimate and may have significant impact on reserve life and retirement reserve and assumption are reviewed regularly and we regularly carry out loss recognition and cash flow testing for further discussion of our loss reserve see item md critical accounting estimate insurance liability loss reserve and insurance reserve loss reserve and note to the consolidated financial statement reinsurance may not be available or affordable and may not be adequate to protect loss our subsidiary are major purchaser of third party reinsurance and we use reinsurance part of our overall risk management strategy our reinsurance business also purchase retrocessional reinsurance which allows reinsurer to cede to another company all or part of the reinsurance obligation originally assumed by the reinsurer while reinsurance doe not discharge our subsidiary from their obligation to pay claim for loss insured or reinsured under our policy it doe make the reinsurer liable to the subsidiary for the reinsured portion of the risk for this reason reinsurance is an important tool to manage transaction and insurance line risk retention and to mitigate loss from catastrophe market condition beyond our control may impact the availability and cost of reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance and could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition for example reinsurance may be more difficult or costly to obtain after year with large number of major catastrophe we may at certain time be forced to incur additional cost for reinsurance or may be unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable term in the latter case we would have to accept an increase in exposure to risk reduce the amount of business written by our subsidiary or seek alternative in line with our risk limit or combination thereof additionally we are exposed to credit risk with respect to our subsidiary reinsurers to the extent the reinsurance receivable is not secured or is inadequately secured by collateral or doe not benefit from other credit enhancement we also bear the risk that reinsurer is or may be unwilling to pay amount we have recorded reinsurance recoverables for any reason including that the term of the reinsurance contract do not reflect the intent of the party to the contract or there is disagreement between the party to their intent ii the term of the contract can not be legally enforced iii the term of the contract are interpreted by court or arbitration panel differently than expected iv the reinsurance transaction performs differently than we anticipated due to flawed design of the reinsurance structure term or condition or change in law and regulation or in the interpretation of the lawsaig form table of content item risk factor and regulation materially impact reinsurance transaction the insolvency of one or more of our reinsurers or the inability or unwillingness of such reinsurers to make timely payment under the term of our contract or payment in an amount equal to our reinsurance recoverable could have material adverse effect on our result of operation and liquidity additionally the use of reinsurance placed in the capital market may not provide the same level of protection traditional reinsurance transaction any disruption volatility and uncertainty in these market such following major catastrophic event may limit our ability to access such market on term favorable to or at all also to the extent that we intend to use structure based on an industry loss index or other non indemnity trigger rather than on actual loss incurred by we could be subject to residual risk we currently have limited reinsurance coverage for terrorist attack further the availability of private sector reinsurance for terrorism is limited we rely heavily on the terrorism risk insurance program tripra which provides government risk assistance to the insurance industry to manage the exposure to terrorism incident in the tripra wa reauthorized in december for further seven year under tripra once our loss for certain act of terrorism exceed deductible equal to percent of our direct commercial property and casualty insurance premium for covered line for the prior calendar year the federal government will reimburse for percent of loss in excess of our deductible up to total industry program limit of billion tripra doe not cover loss in certain line of business such personal property and personal casualty we also rely on the government sponsored and government arranged terrorism

windstorm flooding earthquake wildfire solar storm war or other military action act of terrorism explosion and fire cyber crime product defect pandemic and other highly contagious disease mass tort and other catastrophe have adversely affected our business in the past and could do so in the future for example we incurred pre tax catastrophe loss of billion in which included loss from typhoon in japan hurricane dorian tornado in dallas and wildfire in california and pre tax catastrophe loss of billion in which included loss from hurricane florence and michael typhoon and earthquake in japan and mudslide and wildfire in california catastrophic event and any relevant regulation could expose to widespread claim cost associated with property worker compensation accident and health business interruption and mortality and morbidity claim loss resulting from decline in the value of our invested asset limitation on our ability to recover deferred tax asset loss resulting from actual policy experience that is adverse compared to the assumption made in product pricing decline in value and or loss with respect to company and other entity whose security we hold and counterparties we transact business with and have credit exposure to including reinsurers and decline in the value of investment and significant disruption to our physical infrastructure system and operation natural

income and spread net realized capital gain and loss fee surrender rate mortality experience policyholder behavior experience and equity market return and volatility if actual and or future estimated gross profit are le than originally expected then the amortization of these cost would be accelerated in the period the actual experience is known and would result in charge to income for example if interest rate rise rapidly and significantly customer with policy that have interest crediting rate below the current market may seek competing product with higher return and we may experience an increase in surrender and withdrawal of life and annuity contract and thereby strain on cash flow additionally this would also result in decrease in future profitability and an acceleration of the

when the percentage of aig parent ownership by value by one or more percent shareholder defined in the code ha increased by more than percentage point over the lowest percentage owned by such

change tax loss and credit carryforwards equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate posted monthly by the irs subject to certain adjustment the annual limitation would be increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in prior year the limitation on our ability to utilize tax loss and credit carryforwards arising from an ownership change under section of the code would depend on the value of our equity at the time of any ownership change if we were to experience an ownership change

would expire on the third anniversary of the date of our annual meeting of shareholder the plan is designed to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change by discouraging any person or group from becoming percent shareholder and ii discouraging any existing percent shareholder from acquiring additional share of aig common stock the protective amendment generally restricts any transfer of aig common stock that would increase the ownership by any person to percent or more of aig common stock then outstanding or ii increase the percentage of aig common stock owned by five percent stockholder defined in the plan despite the intention of the plan and the protective amendment to deter and prevent an ownership change such an event may still occur in addition the plan and the protective amendment may make it more difficult and more expensive to acquire and may discourage open market purchase of aig common stock or non negotiated tender or exchange offer for aig common stock accordingly the plan and the protective amendment may limit shareholder ability to realize premium over the market price of aig common stock in connection with any stock transaction change to tax law including legislation enacted in late could increase our corporate tax or make some of our product le attractive to consumer on december president trump signed major tax legislation into law public

by reducing or eliminating deduction for certain item reduction to separate account dividend received deduction disallowance of entertainment expense and limitation on the deduction of certain executive compensation cost will offset portion of the benefit from the lower statutory rate other specific change including the calculation of insurance tax reserve and the amortization of deferred acquisition cost will impact the timing of our tax expense item and could impact the pricing of certain insurance product in addition to changing the taxation of corporation in general and insurance company in particular the tax act temporarily reduced certain tax rate for individual and increased the exemption for the federal estate tax these change could reduce demand in the for life insurance and annuity contract which would reduce our income due to lower sale of these product or potential increased surrender of in force business furthermore the overall impact of the tax act is subject to the effect of other complex provision in the tax act including the base erosion and anti abuse tax beat and global intangible low taxed income gilti which reduce portion of the benefit from the lower statutory federal rate while the tax authority issued formal guidance and recently issued proposed and final regulation for beat and other provision of the tax act there are still certain aspect of the tax act that remain unclear aig will continue to review the impact of beat gilti and related provision further guidance is issued any further guidance may result in change to the interpretation

similar to beat or enacted in response to proposal by the organisation for economic co operation and development could make substantive change to the global international tax regime such change could impact cross border reinsurance transaction which could increase our tax cost globally finally it is possible that tax law will be further changed either in technical correction bill or entirely new

profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset and estimate associated with the tax act these accounting estimate require the use of assumption about matter some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation to the extent actual experience differs from the assumption used our consolidated financial condition result of operation and cash flow could be materially affected insurance liabilitiesloss reservesthe estimate of the loss reserve relies on several key judgment the determination of the actuarial model used the basis for these estimate the relative weight given to these model by product line the underlying assumption used in these model and the determination of the appropriate grouping of similar product line and in some case the disaggregation of dissimilar loss within product line we use numerous assumption in determining the best estimate of reserve for each line of business the importance of any specific assumption can vary by both line of business and accident year because actual experience can differ from key assumption used in establishing reserve there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserve this is particularly true for long tail class of business all of our method to calculate net reserve include assumption about estimated reinsurance recovery and their collectability reinsurance collectability is evaluated independently of the reserving process and appropriate allowance for uncollectible reinsurance are established aig form table of content item critical accounting estimate overview of loss reserving process and methodsour loss reserve can generally be categorized into two distinct group short tail reserve consists principally of property and special risk europe property and special risk personal insurance and europe and japan personal insurance long tail reserve include worker compensation excess casualty other casualty financial line europe casualty and financial line and run off long tail insurance line short tail reservesfor our short tail coverage such property where the nature of claim is generally high frequency with short reporting period with volatility arising from occasional severe event the process for recording non catastrophe quarterly loss reserve is geared toward maintaining ibnr based on percentage of net earned premium for that business rather than projecting ultimate loss ratio based on reported loss for example the ibnr reserve required for the latest accident quarter for product line such homeowner might be approximately percent of the quarter earned premium this level of reserve would generally be recorded regardless of the actual loss reported in the current quarter thus recognizing severe event they occur the percent of premium factor reflects both our expectation of the ultimate loss cost associated with the line of business and the expectation of the percentage of ultimate loss cost that have not yet been reported the expected ultimate loss cost generally reflect the average loss cost from period of preceding accident quarter that have been adjusted for change in rate and loss cost level mix of business known exposure to unreported loss or other factor affecting the particular line of business the expected percentage of ultimate loss cost that have not yet been reported would be derived from historical loss emergence pattern for more mature quarter specific loss development method would be used to determine the ibnr for other product line where the nature of claim is high frequency but low severity method including loss development frequency severity or multiple of average monthly loss may be used to determine ibnr reserve ibnr for claim arising from catastrophic event or event of unusual severity would be determined in close collaboration with the claim department knowledge of known information using alternative technique or expected percentage of ultimate loss cost emergence based on historical loss emergence of similar claim type long tail reservesestimation of ultimate net loss and loss adjustment expense net loss for our long tail casualty line of business is complex process and depends on number of factor including the product line and volume of business well estimate of reinsurance recovery experience in the more recent accident year generally provides limited statistical credibility of reported net loss on long tail casualty line of business that is because in the more recent accident year relatively low proportion of estimated ultimate net incurred loss are reported or paid therefore ibnr reserve constitute relatively high proportion of net loss for our longer tail line we generally make actuarial and other assumption with respect to the following loss cost trend factor are used to establish expected loss ratio for subsequent accident year based on the projected loss ratio for prior accident year expected loss ratio are used for the latest accident year accident year for the year end loss reserve analysis and in some case for accident year prior to the latest accident year the expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident year adjusted for the loss cost trend and the effect of rate change and other quantifiable factor on the loss ratio for low frequency high severity line of business such excess casualty expected loss ratio generally are used for at least the three most recent accident year loss development factor are used to project the reported loss for each accident year to an ultimate basis generally the actual loss development factor observed from prior accident year would be used basis to determine the loss development factor for the subsequent accident year tail factor are development factor used for certain longer tailed line of business for example excess casualty worker compensation and general liability to project future loss development for period that extend beyond the available development data the development of loss to the ultimate loss for given accident year for these line may take decade and the projection of ultimate loss for an accident year is very sensitive to the tail factor selected beyond certain age aig form ktable of content item critical accounting estimate we record quarterly change in loss reserve for each product line of business the overall change in our loss reserve is based on the sum of the change for all product line of business for most long tail product line of business the quarterly loss reserve change are based on the estimated current loss ratio for each subset of coverage le any amount paid also any change in estimated ultimate loss from prior accident year deemed to be necessary based on the result of our latest detailed valuation review large loss analysis or other analytical technique either positive or negative is reflected in the loss reserve and incurred loss for the current quarter difference between actual loss emergence in given period and our expectation based on prior loss reserve estimate are used to monitor reserve adequacy between detailed valuation review and may also influence our judgment with respect to adjusting reserve estimate detail of the loss reserving processthe process of determining the current loss ratio for each product line of business is based on variety of factor these include consideration such prior accident year and policy year loss ratio rate change and change in coverage reinsurance or mix of business other consideration include actual and anticipated change in external factor such trend in loss cost inflation employment rate or unemployment duration or in the legal and claim environment the current loss ratio for each product line of business is intended to represent our best estimate after reflecting all of the relevant factor at the close of each quarter the assumption and data underlying the loss ratio are reviewed to determine whether the loss ratio remain appropriate this process includes review of the actual loss experience in the quarter actual rate change achieved actual change in reinsurance quantifiable change in coverage or mix of business and change in other factor that may affect the loss ratio when this review suggests that the previously determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate the loss ratio is changed to reflect the revised estimate we conduct comprehensive loss detailed valuation review at least annually for each product line of business in accordance with actuarial standard of practice these standard provide that the unpaid loss estimate may be presented in variety of way such point estimate range of estimate point estimate based on the expected value of several reasonable estimate or probability distribution of the unpaid loss amount our actuarial best estimate for each product line of business represents an expected value generally considering range of reasonably possible outcome the reserve analysis for each product line of business is performed by credentialed actuarial team in collaboration with claim underwriting business unit management risk management and senior management our actuary consider the ongoing applicability of prior data grouping and update numerous assumption including the analysis and selection of loss development and loss trend factor they also determine and select the appropriate actuarial or other method used to estimate reserve adequacy for each business product line and may employ multiple method and assumption for each product line these data grouping accident year weight method selection and assumption necessarily change over time business mix change development factor mature and become more credible and loss characteristic evolve in the course of these detailed valuation review an actuarial best estimate of the loss reserve is determined the sum of these estimate for each product line of business yield an overall actuarial best estimate for that line of business for certain product line we measure sensitivity and determine explicit range around the actuarial best estimate using multiple methodology and varying assumption where we have range we use them to inform our selection of best estimate of loss reserve by major product line of business our range of reasonable estimate is not intended to cover all possibility or extreme value and is based on known data and fact at the time of estimation we consult with third party environmental litigation and engineering specialist third party toxic tort claim professional third party clinical and public health specialist third party worker compensation claim adjuster and third party actuarial advisor to help inform our judgment needed critical component of our detailed valuation review is an internal peer review of our reserving analysis and conclusion where actuary independent of the initial review evaluate the reasonableness of assumption used method selected and weighting given to different method in addition each detailed valuation review is subjected to review and challenge process by specialist in our enterprise risk management group aig form table of content item critical accounting estimate we consider key factor in performing detailed actuarial review including an assessment of economic condition including inflation employment rate or unemployment duration change in the legal regulatory judicial and social environment including change in road safety public health and cleanup standard change in medical cost trend inflation intensity and utilization of medical service and wage inflation trend underlying policy pricing term and condition including attachment point and policy limit change in claim handling philosophy operating model process and related ongoing enhancement third party claim review that are periodically performed for key product line such toxic tort environmental and other complex casualty third party actuarial review that are periodically performed for key product line of business input from underwriter on pricing term and condition and market trend and change in our reinsurance program pricing and commutation actuarial and other method for major line of businessour actuary determine the appropriate actuarial method and segmentation this determination is based on variety of factor including the nature of the loss associated with the product line of business such the frequency or severity of the claim in addition to determining the actuarial method the actuary determine the appropriate loss reserve grouping of data this determination is judgmental dynamic process and refinement to the grouping are made every year the change to grouping may be driven by and may change to reflect observed or emerging pattern within and across product line or to differentiate different risk characteristic for example size of deductible and extent of third party claim specialist used by our insured an example of reserve segmentation we write many unique subset of professional liability which cover different product industry segment and coverage structure while for pricing or other purpose it may be appropriate to evaluate the profitability of each subset individually we believe it is appropriate to combine the subset into larger group for reserving purpose to produce greater degree of credibility in the loss experience this determination of data segmentation and related actuarial method is assessed reviewed and updated at least annually the actuarial method we use most commonly include paid and incurred loss development method expected loss ratio method including bornhuetter ferguson and cape cod and frequency severity model loss development method utilize the actual loss development pattern from prior accident year updated through the current year to project the reported loss to an ultimate basis for all accident year we also use this information to update our current accident year loss selection loss development method are generally most appropriate for class of business that exhibit stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next and for which the component of the product line have similar development characteristic for example property exposure would generally not be combined into the same product line casualty exposure and primary casualty exposure would generally not be combined into the same product line excess casualty exposure we continually refine our loss reserving technique and adopt further segmentation based on our analysis of differing emerging loss pattern for certain product line we generally use expected loss ratio method in case where the reported loss data lacked sufficient credibility to utilize loss development method such for new product line of business or for long tail product line at early stage of loss development frequency severity model may be used where sufficient frequency count are available to apply such approach expected loss ratio method rely on the application of an expected loss ratio to the earned premium for the product line of business to determine the liability for loss reserve and loss adjustment expense for example an expected loss ratio of percent applied to an earned premium base of million for product line of business would generate an ultimate loss estimate of million subtracting any paid loss and loss adjustment expense would result in the indicated loss reserve for this product line under the bornhuetter ferguson method the expected loss ratio is applied only to the expected unreported portion of the loss for example for long tail product line of business for which only percent of the loss are expected to be reported at the end of the accident year the expected loss ratio would be used to represent the percent of loss still unreported the actual reported loss at the end of the accident year would be added to determine the total ultimate loss estimate for the accident year subtracting the reported paid loss and loss adjustment expense would result in the indicated loss reserve in the example above the expected loss ratio of percent would be multiplied by percent the result of percent would be applied to the earned premium of million resulting in an estimated unreported loss of million actual reported loss would be added to arrive at the total ultimate loss if the reported loss were million the ultimate loss estimate under the bornhuetter ferguson method would be million versus the million amount under the expected loss ratio method described above thus the bornhuetter ferguson method give partial credibility to the actual loss experience to date for the product line of business loss development method generally give full credibility to the reported loss experience to date in the example above loss development method would typically indicate an ultimate loss estimate of million the reported loss of million would be estimated to reflect only percent of the ultimate loss aig form ktable of content item critical accounting estimate key advantage of loss development method is that they respond more quickly to any actual change in loss cost for the product line of business therefore if loss experience is unexpectedly deteriorating or improving the loss development method give full credibility to the changing experience expected loss ratio method would be slower to respond to the change they would continue to give more weight to prior expected loss ratio until enough evidence emerged to modify the expected loss ratio to reflect the changing loss experience on the other hand loss development method have the disadvantage of overreacting to change in reported loss if the loss experience is anomalous due to the various key factor described above and the inherent volatility in some of the class for example the presence or absence of large loss at the early stage of loss development could cause the loss development method to overreact to the favorable or unfavorable experience by assuming it is fundamental shift in the development pattern in these instance expected loss ratio method such bornhuetter ferguson have the advantage of recognizing large loss without extrapolating unusual large loss activity onto the unreported portion of the loss for the accident year the cape cod method is hybrid between the loss development and bornhuetter ferguson method where the historic loss data and loss development factor assumption are used to determine the expected loss ratio estimate in the bornhuetter ferguson method frequency severity method generally rely on the determination of an ultimate number of claim and an average severity for each claim for each accident year multiplying the estimated ultimate number of claim for each accident year by the expected average severity of each claim produce the estimated ultimate loss for the accident year frequency severity method generally require sufficient volume of claim in order for the average severity to be predictable average severity for subsequent accident year is generally determined by applying an estimated annual loss cost trend to the estimated average claim severity from prior accident year in certain case structural approach may also be used to predict the ultimate loss cost frequency severity method have the advantage that ultimate claim count can generally be estimated more quickly and accurately than can ultimate loss thus if the average claim severity can be accurately estimated these method can more quickly respond to change in loss experience than other method however for average severity to be predictable the product line of business must consist of homogenous type of claim for which loss severity trend from one year to the next are reasonably consistent and where there are limited change to deductible level or limit generally these method work best for high frequency low severity product line of business such personal auto however frequency and severity metric are also used to test the reasonability of result for other product line of business and provide indication of underlying trend in the data in addition ultimate claim count can be used an alternative exposure measure to earned premium in the cape cod method structural driver analytics seek to explain the underlying driver of frequency severity structural driver analysis of frequency severity is particularly useful for understanding the key driver of uncertainty in the ultimate loss cost for example for the excess worker compensation product line of business we have attempted to corroborate our judgment by considering the impact on severity of the future potential for deterioration of an injured worker medical condition the impact of price inflation on the various category of medical expense and cost of living adjustment on indemnity benefit the impact of injured worker mortality and claim specific settlement and loss mitigation strategy etc using the following claim by claim review often facilitated by third party specialist to determine the stability and likelihood of settling an injured worker indemnity and medical benefit analysis of the potential for future deterioration in medical condition unlikely to be picked up by claim file review and associated with potentially costly medical procedure increase in both utilization and intensity of medical care over the course of the injured worker lifetime analysis of the cost of medical price inflation for each category of medical spend service and device and for cost of living adjustment in line with statutory requirement portfolio specific mortality level and mortality improvement assumption based on mortality study conducted for our primary and excess worker compensation portfolio and our opinion of future longevity trend for the open reported case ground up consideration of the reinsurance recovery expected for the product line of business for reported claim with extrapolation for unreported claim and the effect of various run off loss management strategy that have been developed by our run off unit aig form table of content item critical accounting estimate in recent year we have expanded our analysis of structural driver to additional product line of business mean of corroborating our judgment using traditional actuarial technique for example we have explicitly used external estimate of future medical inflation and mortality in estimating the loss development tail for excess of deductible primary worker compensation business using external forecast for item such these can improve the accuracy and stability of our estimate the estimation of liability for loss reserve and loss adjustment expense relating to asbestos and environmental pollution loss on insurance policy written many year ago is typically subject to greater uncertainty than other type of loss this is due to inconsistent court decision well judicial interpretation and legislative action that in some case have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policy or have expanded theory of liability in addition reinsurance recoverable balance relating to asbestos and environmental loss reserve are subject to greater uncertainty due to the underlying age of the claim underlying legal issue surrounding the nature of the coverage and determination of proper policy period for these reason these balance tend to be subject to increased level of dispute and legal collection activity when actually billed the insurance industry whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issue and is thus confronted with continuing uncertainty in it effort to quantify these exposure we continue to receive claim asserting injury and damage from toxic waste hazardous substance and other environmental pollutant and alleged claim to cover the cleanup cost of hazardous waste dump site referred to collectively environmental claim and indemnity claim asserting injury from asbestos the vast majority of these asbestos and environmental loss emanate from policy written in and prior year commencing in standard policy contained absolute exclusion for pollution related damage and asbestos the current environmental policy that we specifically price and underwrite for environmental risk on claim made basis have been excluded from the analysis the majority of our exposure for asbestos and environmental loss are related to excess casualty coverage not primary coverage the litigation cost are treated in the same manner indemnity amount with litigation expense included within the limit of the liability we incur individual significant loss reserve where future litigation cost are reasonably determinable are established on case by case basis discussion of key assumption of our actuarial methodsline ofbusiness or categorykey assumption worker compensationwe generally use combination of loss development and expected loss ratio method for worker compensation this line of business is long tail the loss cost trend assumption is not believed to be material with respect to our guaranteed cost loss reserve this is primarily because our actuary are generally able to use loss development projection for all but the most recent accident year reserve so there is limited need to rely on loss cost trend assumption for primary worker compensation business the tail factor is typically the most critical assumption and small change in the selected tail factor can have material effect on our carried reserve for example the tail factor beyond twenty year for guaranteed cost business could vary by one and one half percent below to two percent above those actually indicated in the loss reserve review for excess of deductible business in our judgment it is reasonably likely that tail factor beyond twenty year could vary by four percent below to six percent above those actually indicated in the loss reserve review aig form ktable of content item critical accounting estimate line ofbusiness or categorykey assumption excess casualtywe utilize various loss cost trend assumption for different segment of the portfolio after evaluating the historical loss cost trend from prior accident year since the early in our judgment it is reasonably likely that actual loss cost trend applicable to the year end loss reserve review for excess casualty may range five percent lower or higher than this estimated loss trend the loss cost trend assumption is critical for the excess casualty class of business due to the long tail nature of the loss and is applied across many accident year thus there is the potential for the loss reserve with respect to number of accident year the expected loss ratio year to be significantly affected by change in loss cost trend that were initially relied upon in setting the loss reserve these change in loss trend could be attributable to change in inflation or in the judicial environment or in other social or economic condition affecting loss excess casualty is long tail class of business and any deviation in loss development factor might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimate for any accident year mass tort claim in particular may develop over very extended period and impact multiple accident year so we usually select separate pattern for them thus there is the potential for the loss reserve with respect to number of accident year to be significantly affected by change in loss development factor that were initially relied upon in setting the reserve after evaluating the historical loss development factor from prior accident year since the early in our judgment it is reasonably likely that the actual loss development factor could vary by an amount equivalent to six month shift from those actually utilized in the year end reserve review this would impact projection both for accident year where the selection were directly based on loss development method well the priori loss ratio assumption for accident year with selection based on bornhuetter ferguson or cape cod method similar to loss cost trend these change in loss development factor could be attributable to change in inflation or in the judicial environment or in other social or economic condition affecting loss other casualtythe key uncertainty for other casualty line are similar to excess casualty the underlying business is long tailed and can be subject to variability in loss cost trend and change in loss development factor these may differ significantly by line of business coverage such general liability medical malpractice and environmental may be subject to different risk driver financial line the loss cost trend for director and officer liability business vary by year and subset but for the most recent accident year it is assumed to have been generally close to zero after evaluating the historical loss cost level from prior accident year since the early including the potential effect of loss relating to the credit crisis in our judgment it is reasonably likely that the actual variation in loss cost level for these subset could vary by approximately percent lower or higher on year over year basis than the assumption actually utilized in the year end reserve review because business ha exhibited highly volatile loss trend from one accident year to the next there is the possibility of an exceptionally high deviation in our analysis the effect of loss cost trend assumption affect the result through the priori loss ratio assumption used for the bornhuetter ferguson and cape cod method which impact the projection for the more recent accident year the selected loss development factor are also an important assumption but are le critical than for excess casualty because these class are written on claim made basis the loss reporting and development tail is much shorter than for excess casualty however the high severity nature of the loss doe create the potential for significant deviation in loss development pattern from one year to the next similar to excess casualty after evaluating the historical loss development factor from prior accident year since the early in our judgment it is reasonably likely that actual loss development factor could change by an amount equivalent to shift by six month from those actually utilized in the year end reserve review europe casualty and financial linessimilar to business european casualty and financial line can be significantly impacted by loss cost trend and change in loss development factor the variation in such factor can differ significantly by product and region property and special risk and europe property and special risksfor short tail line such property and special risk variance in outcome for individual large claim or event can have significant impact on result these outcome generally relate to unique characteristic of event such catastrophe or loss with significant business interruption claim personal insurance and europe and japan personal insurancepersonal insurance is short tailed in nature similar to property and special risk but le volatile variance in estimate can result from unique event such catastrophe in addition some subset of this business such auto liability can be impacted by change in loss development factor and loss cost trend aig form table of content item critical accounting

compensation and other run off segment for environmental claim we have utilized variety of method including traditional loss development approach claim department and other expert evaluation of the ultimate cost for certain claim and survival ratio metric run off long tail insurance line is an extremely long tail class of business with much greater than normal uncertainty to the appropriate loss development factor for the tail of the loss development specifically for excess worker compensation after evaluating the historical loss development factor for prior accident year since the well the

likely that the tail factor beyond year could vary by percent above or below that actually indicated in the loss reserve review other reserve itemsloss adjustment expense lae are separated into two broad category allocated loss adjustment expense ala also referred to legal defense and cost containment or legal and unallocated loss adjustment expense which includes certain claim adjuster fee and other internal claim management cost we determine reserve for legal expense for each class of business by one or more actuarial or structural driver method for the majority of segment legal cost are analyzed in conjunction with loss for segment where they are separately analyzed the method used generally include development method comparable to those described for loss development method the development could be based on either the paid loss adjustment expense or the ratio of paid loss adjustment expense to paid loss or both other method include the utilization of expected ultimate ratio of paid loss expense to paid loss based on actual experience from prior accident year or from similar product line of business the bulk of adjuster expense are allocated and charged to individual claim file for these expense we generally determine reserve based on calendar year ratio of adjuster expense paid to loss paid for the particular product line of business for other internal claim cost which generally relate to specific claim department expense that are not allocated to individual claim file such technology cost and other broad initiative we look at historic and expected expenditure for these item and project these into the future the incidence of lae is directly related to the frequency complexity and level of underlying claim result key driver of variability in lae is the variability in the overall claim particularly for long tail line the following sensitivity analysis table summarizes the effect on the loss reserve position of using certain alternative loss cost

experience with the product loss recognition occurs if observed change in actual experience or estimate result in projected future loss under loss recognition testing to determine whether loss recognition exists we determine whether future loss is expected based on updated current assumption if loss recognition exists we recognize the loss by first reducing dac through amortization expense and if dac is depleted record additional liability through charge to policyholder benefit expense because of the long term nature of many of our liability subject to the lock in principle small change

the following to determine investment return used in loss recognition test we typically match liability with asset of comparable duration to the extent practicable and then project future cash flow on those asset asset supporting insurance liability are primarily comprised of diversified portfolio of high to medium quality fixed maturity security and may also include to lesser extent alternative investment our projection include reasonable allowance for investment expense and expected credit loss over the projection horizon critical assumption in the projection of expected investment income is the assumed net rate of investment return at which excess cash flow are to be reinvested for product in which asset and liability duration are matched relatively well this is le of consideration since interest on excess cash flow are not significant component of future cash flow for the reinvestment rate assumption anticipated future change to the yield curve could have large effect given the interest rate environment applicable at the date of our most recent loss recognition test we assumed modest and gradual increase in long term interest rate over time for mortality assumption key judgment include the extent of industry versus own experience to base future assumption well the extent of expected mortality improvement in the future the latter judgment is based on combination of historical mortality trend and advice from industry public health and demography specialist that were consulted by aig actuary and published industry information for surrender rate key judgment involves the correlation between expected increase decrease in interest rate and increase decrease in surrender rate to support this judgment we compare crediting rate on our product to expected rate on competing product under different interest rate scenario for in force long term care insurance rate increase are allowed but must be approved by state insurance regulator consequently the extent of

such financial asset subject to credit loss including loan measured at amortized cost reinsurance receivables and certain off balance sheet credit exposure additionally the impairment of available for sale debt security including purchased credit deteriorated security is subject to the new guidance and will be measured in similar manner except that loss will be recognized allowance rather than reduction in the amortized cost of the security the standard will allow for reversal of credit impairment in the event that the credit of an issuer improves the standard also requires additional disclosure we adopted the standard on it effective date of january using modified retrospective method which requires cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of december the impact of the adoption of the standard will be reduction in opening retained earnings of approximately million pre tax primarily driven by commercial mortgage loan and to lesser extent reinsurance receivables and recoverables simplifying the test for goodwill impairmentin january the fasb issued an accounting standard that eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill through hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure goodwill impairment charge instead entity will record an impairment charge based on the excess of reporting unit carrying amount over it fair value

of financial instrument the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date we are responsible for the determination of the value of the investment carried at fair value and the supporting methodology and assumption the degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instrument generally inversely correlate with the level of observable valuation input we maximize the use of observable input and minimize the use of unobservable input when measuring fair value financial instrument with quoted price in active market generally have more pricing observability and le judgment is used in measuring fair value conversely financial instrument for which no quoted price are available have le observability and are measured at fair value using valuation model or other pricing technique that require more judgment pricing observability is affected by number of factor including the type of financial instrument whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established the characteristic specific to the transaction liquidity and general market condition aig form table of content item note to consolidated financial statement fair value measurement fair value hierarchyassets and liability recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet are measured and classified in accordance with fair value hierarchy consisting of three level based on the observability of valuation input level fair value measurement based on quoted price unadjusted in active market that we have the ability to access for identical asset or liability market price data generally is obtained from exchange or dealer market we do not adjust the quoted price for such instrument level fair value measurement based on input other than quoted price included in level that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level input include quoted price for similar asset and liability in active market quoted price for identical or similar asset or liability in market that are not active and input other than quoted price that are observable for the asset or liability such interest rate and yield curve that are observable at commonly quoted interval level fair value measurement based on valuation technique that use significant input that are unobservable both observable and unobservable input may be used to determine the fair value of position classified in level the circumstance for using these measurement include those in which there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability therefore we must make certain assumption about the input hypothetical market participant would use to value that asset or liability in certain case the input used to measure fair value may fall into different level of the fair value hierarchy in such case the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in it entirety fall is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in it entirety the following is description of the valuation methodology used for instrument carried at fair value these methodology are applied to asset and liability across the level discussed above and it is the observability of the input used that determines the appropriate level in the fair value hierarchy for the respective asset or liability valuation methodology of financial instrument measured at fair valueincorporation of credit risk in fair value measurement our own credit risk fair value measurement for certain liability incorporate our own credit risk by determining the explicit cost for each counterparty to protect against it net credit exposure to at the balance sheet date by reference to observable aig credit default swap cd or cash bond spread we calculate the effect of credit spread change using discounted cash flow technique that incorporate current market interest rate derivative counterparty net credit exposure to is determined based on master netting agreement when applicable which take into consideration all derivative position with well collateral we post with the counterparty at the balance sheet date for description of how we incorporate our own credit risk in the valuation of embedded derivative related to certain annuity and life insurance product see embedded derivative within policyholder contract deposit below counterparty credit risk fair value measurement for freestanding derivative incorporate counterparty credit by determining the explicit cost for to protect against our net credit exposure to each counterparty at the balance sheet date by reference to observable counterparty cd spread when available when not available other directly or indirectly observable credit spread will be used to derive the best estimate of the counterparty spread our net credit exposure to counterparty is determined based on master netting agreement which take into consideration all derivative position with the counterparty well collateral posted by the counterparty at the balance sheet date fair value for fixed maturity security based on observable market price for identical or similar instrument implicitly incorporate counterparty credit risk fair value for fixed maturity security based on internal model incorporate counterparty credit risk by using discount rate that take into consideration cash issuance spread for similar instrument or other observable information for fair value measured based on internal model the cost of credit protection is determined under discounted present value approach considering the market level for single name cd spread for each specific counterparty the mid market value of the net exposure reflecting the amount of protection required and the weighted average life of the net exposure cd spread are provided to by an independent third party we utilize an interest rate based on the benchmark london interbank offered rate libor curve to derive our discount rate while this approach doe not explicitly consider all potential future behavior of the derivative transaction or potential future change in valuation input we believe this approach provides reasonable estimate of the fair value of the asset and liability including consideration of the impact of non performance risk aig form ktable of content item note to consolidated financial statement fair value measurement fixed maturity securitieswhenever available we obtain quoted price in active market for identical asset at the balance sheet date to measure fixed maturity security at fair value market price data is generally obtained from dealer market we employ independent third party valuation service provider to gather analyze and interpret market information to derive fair value estimate for individual investment based upon market accepted methodology and assumption the methodology used by these independent third party valuation service provider are reviewed and understood by management through periodic discussion with and information provided by the independent third party valuation service provider in addition discussed further below control process are applied to the fair value received from independent third party valuation service provider to ensure the accuracy of these value valuation service provider typically obtain data about market transaction and other key valuation model input from multiple source and through the use of market accepted valuation methodology which may utilize matrix pricing financial model accompanying model input and various assumption provide single fair value measurement for individual security the input used by the valuation service provider include but are not limited to market price from completed transaction for identical security and transaction for comparable security benchmark yield interest rate yield curve credit spread prepayment rate default rate recovery assumption currency rate quoted price for similar security and other market observable information applicable if fair value is determined using financial model these model generally take into account among other thing market observable information of the measurement date well the specific attribute of the security being valued including it term interest rate credit rating industry sector and when applicable collateral quality and other security or issuer specific information when market transaction or other market observable data is limited the extent to which judgment is applied in determining fair value is greatly increased we have control process designed to ensure that the fair value received from independent third party valuation service provider are accurately recorded that their data input and valuation technique are appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumption used appear reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value we ass the reasonableness of individual security value received from independent third party valuation service provider through various analytical technique and have procedure to escalate related question internally and to the independent third party valuation service provider for resolution to ass the degree of pricing consensus among various valuation service provider for specific asset type we conduct comparison of price received from available source we use these comparison to establish hierarchy for the fair value received from independent third party valuation service provider to be used for particular security class we also validate price for selected security through review by member of management who have relevant expertise and who are independent of those charged with executing investing transaction when our independent third party valuation service provider are unable to obtain sufficient market observable information upon which to estimate the fair value for particular security fair value is determined either by requesting broker who are knowledgeable about these security to provide price quote which is generally non binding or by employing market accepted valuation model broker price may be based on an income approach which convert expected future cash flow to single present value amount with specific consideration of input relevant to particular security type for structured security such input may include rating collateral type geographic concentration underlying loan vintage loan delinquency and default loss severity assumption prepayment and weighted average coupon and maturity when the volume or level of market activity for security is limited certain input used to determine fair value may not be observable in the market broker price may also be based on market approach that considers recent transaction involving identical or similar security fair value provided by broker are subject to similar control process to those noted above for fair value from independent third party valuation service provider including management review for those corporate debt instrument for example private placement that are not traded in active market or that are subject to transfer restriction valuation reflect illiquidity and non transferability based on available market evidence when observable price quotation are not available fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow model using discount rate based on credit spread yield or price level of comparable security adjusted for illiquidity and structure fair value determined internally are also subject to management review to ensure that valuation model and related input are reasonable the methodology above is relevant for all fixed maturity security including residential mortgage backed security rmbs commercial mortgage backed security cmb collateralized debt obligation cdo other asset backed security ab and fixed maturity security issued by government sponsored entity and corporate entity equity security traded in active marketswhenever available we obtain quoted price in active market for identical asset at the balance sheet date to measure equity security at fair value market price data is generally obtained from exchange or dealer market aig form table of content item note to consolidated financial statement fair value measurement mortgage and other loan receivablewe estimate the fair value of mortgage and other loan receivable that are measured at fair value by using dealer quotation discounted cash flow analysis and or internal valuation model the determination of fair value considers input such interest rate maturity the borrower creditworthiness collateral subordination guarantee past due status yield curve credit curve prepayment rate market pricing for comparable loan and other relevant factor other invested assetswe initially estimate the fair value of investment in certain hedge fund private equity fund and other investment partnership by reference to the transaction price subsequently we generally obtain the fair value of these investment from net asset value information provided by the general partner or manager of the investment the financial statement of which are generally audited annually we consider observable market data and perform certain control procedure to validate the appropriateness of using the net asset value fair value measurement the fair value of other investment carried at fair value such direct private equity holding are initially determined based on transaction price and are subsequently estimated based on available evidence such market transaction in similar instrument other financing transaction of the issuer and other available financial information for the issuer with adjustment made to reflect illiquidity appropriate short term investmentsfor short term investment that are measured at amortized cost the carrying amount of these asset approximate fair value because of the relatively short period of time between origination and expected realization and their limited exposure to credit risk security purchased under agreement to resell reverse repurchase agreement are generally treated collateralized receivables we report certain receivables arising from security purchased under agreement to resell short term investment in the consolidated balance sheet when these receivables are measured at fair value we use market observable interest rate to determine fair value separate account assetsseparate account asset are composed primarily of registered and unregistered open end mutual fund that generally trade daily and are measured at fair value in the manner discussed above for equity security traded in active market freestanding derivativesderivative asset and liability can be exchange traded or traded over the counter otc we generally value exchange traded derivative such future and option using quoted price in active market for identical derivative at the balance sheet date otc derivative are valued using market transaction and other market evidence whenever possible including market based input to model model calibration to market clearing transaction broker or dealer quotation or alternative pricing source with reasonable level of price transparency when model are used the selection of particular model to value an otc derivative depends on the contractual term of and specific risk inherent in the instrument well the availability of pricing information in the market we generally use similar model to value similar instrument valuation model require variety of input including contractual term market price and rate yield curve credit curve measure of volatility prepayment rate and correlation of such input for otc derivative that trade in liquid market such generic forward swap and option model input can generally be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other mean and model selection doe not involve significant management judgment for certain otc derivative that trade in le liquid market where we generally do not have corroborating market evidence to support significant model input and can not verify the model to market transaction the transaction price may provide the best estimate of fair value accordingly when pricing model is used to value such an instrument the model is adjusted so the model value at inception equal the transaction price we will update valuation input in these model only when corroborated by evidence such similar market transaction independent third party valuation service provider and or broker or dealer quotation or other empirical market data when appropriate valuation are adjusted for various factor such liquidity bid offer spread and credit consideration such adjustment are generally based on available market evidence in the absence of such evidence management best estimate is used we value our super senior credit default swap portfolio using price obtained from vendor and or counterparties the valuation of the super senior credit derivative is complex because of the limited availability of market observable information due to the lack of trading and price transparency in certain structured finance market our valuation methodology for the super senior cd portfolio have evolved over time in response to market condition and the availability of market observable information we have sought to calibrate the methodology to available market information and to review the assumption of the methodology on regular basis aig form ktable of content item note to consolidated financial statement fair value measurement embedded derivative within policyholder contract depositscertain variable annuity and equity indexed annuity and life contract contain embedded derivative that we bifurcate from the host contract and account for separately at fair value with change in fair value recognized in earnings these embedded derivative are classified within policyholder contract deposit we have concluded these contract contain either written option that guarantee minimum accumulation value at maturity ii written option that guarantee annual withdrawal regardless of underlying market performance for specific period or for life or iii equity indexed written option that meet the criterion of derivative and must be bifurcated the fair value of embedded derivative contained in certain variable annuity and equity indexed annuity and life contract is measured based on policyholder behavior and capital market assumption related to projected cash flow over the expected life of the contract these discounted cash flow projection primarily include benefit and related fee assessed when applicable in some instance the projected cash flow from fee may exceed projected cash flow related to benefit payment and therefore at point in time the carrying value of the embedded derivative may be in net asset position the projected cash flow incorporate best estimate assumption for policyholder behavior including mortality lapse withdrawal and benefit utilization along with an explicit risk margin to reflect market participant estimate of projected cash flow and policyholder behavior estimate of future policyholder behavior assumption are subjective and based primarily on our historical experience because of the dynamic and complex nature of the projected cash flow with respect to embedded derivative in our variable annuity contract risk neutral valuation are used which are calibrated to observable interest rate and equity option price estimating the underlying cash flow for these product involves judgment regarding the capital market assumption related to expected market rate of return market volatility credit spread correlation of certain market variable fund performance and discount rate additionally estimating the underlying cash flow for these product also involves judgment regarding policyholder behavior the portion of fee attributable to the fair value of expected benefit payment are included within the fair value measurement of these embedded derivative and related fee are classified in net realized gain loss earned consistent with other change in the fair value of these embedded policy derivative any portion of the fee not attributed to the embedded derivative are excluded from the fair value measurement and classified in policy fee earned with respect to embedded derivative in our equity indexed annuity and life contract option pricing model are used to estimate fair value taking into account the capital market assumption for future equity index growth rate volatility of the equity index future interest rate and our ability to adjust the participation rate and the cap on equity indexed credited rate in light of market condition and policyholder behavior assumption projected cash flow are discounted using the interest rate swap curve swap curve which is commonly viewed being consistent with the credit spread for highly rated financial institution aa rated or above swap curve show the fixed rate leg of non complex swap against the floating rate for example libor leg of related tenor we also incorporate our own risk of non performance in the valuation of the embedded derivative associated with variable annuity and equity indexed annuity and life contract the non performance risk adjustment npa reflects market participant view of our claim paying ability by incorporating an additional spread to the swap curve used to discount projected benefit cash flow in the valuation of these embedded derivative the non performance risk adjustment is calculated by constructing forward rate based on weighted average of observable corporate credit index to approximate the claim paying ability rating of our life and retirement company long term debtthe fair value of non structured liability is generally determined by using market price from exchange or dealer market when available or discounting expected cash flow using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable maturity we determine the fair value of structured liability and hybrid financial instrument where performance is linked to structured interest rate inflation or currency risk using the appropriate derivative valuation methodology described above given the nature of the embedded risk profile in addition adjustment are made to the valuation of both non structured and structured liability to reflect our own creditworthiness based on the methodology described under the caption incorporation of credit risk in fair value measurement our own credit risk above borrowing under obligation of guaranteed investment agreement gia which are guaranteed by are recorded at fair value using discounted cash flow calculation based on interest rate currently being offered for similar contract and our current

description of significant unobservable input along with interrelationship between and among the significant unobservable input and their impact on the fair value measurement in practice simultaneous change in assumption may not always have linear effect on the input discussed below interrelationship may also exist between observable and unobservable input such relationship have not been included in the discussion below for each of the individual relationship described below the inverse relationship would also generally apply fixed maturity security the significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of fixed maturity security is yield the yield is affected by the market movement in credit spread and treasury yield the discount rate may be affected by other factor

projected for purpose of valuing the embedded derivative the following unobservable input are used for valuing embedded derivative measured at fair value long term equity volatility represent equity volatility beyond the period for which observable equity volatility are available increase in assumed volatility will generally increase the fair value of both the projected cash flow from rider fee well the projected cash flow related to benefit payment therefore the net change in the fair value of the liability may be either decrease or an increase depending on the relative change in projected rider fee and projected benefit payment equity interest rate correlation estimate the relationship between change in equity return and interest rate in the economic scenario generator used to value our gmwb embedded derivative in general higher positive correlation assumes that equity market and interest rate move in more correlated fashion which generally increase the fair value of the liability base lapse rate assumption are determined by company experience and are adjusted at the contract level using dynamic lapse function which reduces the base lapse rate when the contract is in the money when the contract holder guaranteed value estimated by the company is worth more than their underlying account value lapse rate are also generally assumed to be lower in period when surrender charge applies increase in assumed lapse rate will generally decrease the fair value of the liability fewer policyholder would persist to collect guaranteed withdrawal amount mortality rate assumption which vary by age and gender are based on company experience and include mortality improvement assumption increase in assumed mortality rate will decrease the fair value of the liability while lower mortality rate assumption will generally increase the fair value of the liability because guaranteed payment will be made for longer period of time utilization assumption estimate the timing when policyholder with gmwb will elect to utilize their benefit and begin taking withdrawal the assumption may vary by the type of guarantee tax qualified status the contract withdrawal history and the age of the policyholder utilization assumption are based on company experience which includes partial withdrawal behavior increase in assumed utilization rate will generally increase the fair

measured at fair value with change in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period result of the standard equity security with readily determinable fair value were no longer required to be evaluated for other than temporary impairment prior to the adoption of the recognition and measurement standard on january we evaluated our available for sale equity security for impairment by considering such security candidate for other than temporary impairment if they had met any of the following criterion the security had traded at significant percent or more discount to cost for an extended period of time nine consecutive month or longer discrete credit event had occurred resulting in the issuer defaulting on material outstanding obligation ii the issuer seeking protection from creditor under the bankruptcy law or any similar law intended for court supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprise or iii the issuer proposing voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditor are asked to exchange their claim for cash or security having fair value substantially lower than the par value of their claim or we had concluded that we may not realize full recovery on our investment regardless of the occurrence of one of the foregoing event the determination that an equity security wa other than temporarily impaired required the judgment of management and consideration of the fundamental condition of the issuer it near term prospect and all the relevant fact and circumstance in addition to the above criterion all equity security that have been in continuous decline in value below cost over month are impaired we also considered circumstance of rapid and severe market valuation decline percent or more discount to cost in which we could not reasonably assert that the impairment period would be temporary severity loss other invested assetsour equity method investment in private equity fund hedge fund and other entity are evaluated for impairment each reporting period such evaluation considers market condition event and volatility that may impact the recoverability of the underlying investment within these private equity fund and hedge fund and is based on

on contract by contract basis quarterly an investment in life settlement wa considered impaired if the undiscounted cash flow resulting from the expected proceeds would not be sufficient to recover our estimated future carrying amount which wa the current carrying amount for the investment in life settlement plus anticipated undiscounted future premium and other capitalizable future cost if any

mortality improvement likely to apply to the insured life population our mortality assumption coupled with the mortality improvement rate were used in our estimate of future net cash flow from the investment in life settlement we sold the remaining portion of our life settlement portfolio in our investment in aircraft asset and real estate are periodically evaluated for recoverability whenever

impaired pci securitieswe purchase certain rmbs security that have experienced deterioration in credit quality since their issuance we determine whether it is probable at acquisition that we will not collect all contractually required payment for these pci security including both principal and interest at acquisition the timing and amount of the undiscounted future cash flow expected to be received on each pci security is determined based on our best estimate using key assumption such interest rate default rate and prepayment speed at acquisition the difference between the undiscounted expected future cash flow of the pci security and the recorded investment in the security represents the initial accretable yield which is accreted into net investment income over their remaining life on an effective yield basis additionally the difference between the contractually required payment on the pci security and the undiscounted expected future cash flow represents the non accretable difference at acquisition the accretable yield and the non accretable difference will change over time based on actual payment received and change in estimate of undiscounted expected future cash flow which are discussed further below on quarterly basis the undiscounted expected future cash flow associated with pci security are re evaluated based on update to key assumption decline in undiscounted

when policy is issued and do not change with change in actual experience unless loss recognition event occurs these locked in assumption include mortality morbidity persistency maintenance expense and investment return and include margin for adverse deviation to reflect uncertainty given that actual experience might deviate from these assumption loss recognition event occurs when there is shortfall between the carrying amount of future policy benefit liability net of dac and what the future policy benefit liability net of dac would be when applying updated current assumption when we determine loss recognition event ha occurred we first reduce any dac related to that block of business through amortization of acquisition expense and after dac is depleted we record additional liability through charge to policyholder benefit and loss incurred grouping for loss recognition testing are consistent with our manner of acquiring servicing and measuring the profitability of the business and

gross profit change significantly dac is recalculated using the new assumption and any resulting adjustment is included in income if the new assumption indicate that future estimated gross profit are higher than previously estimated dac will be increased resulting in decrease in amortization expense and increase in income in the current period if future estimated gross profit are lower than previously estimated dac will be decreased resulting in an increase in amortization expense and decrease in income in the current period updating such assumption may result in acceleration of

short tail exposure which include paid development method the paid development method estimate ultimate loss by reviewing paid loss pattern and selecting paid ultimate loss development factor these factor are then applied to paid loss by applying them to accident year with further expected change in paid loss since the method doe not rely on case reserve it is not directly influenced by change in the adequacy of case reserve incurred development method the incurred development method is similar to the paid development method but it us case incurred loss instead of paid loss since this method us more data case reserve in addition to paid loss than the paid development method the incurred development pattern may be le variable than paid development pattern expected loss ratio method the expected loss ratio method multiplies premium by an expected loss ratio to produce ultimate loss estimate for each accident year this method may be useful if loss development pattern are inconsistent loss emerge very slowly or there is relatively little loss history from which to estimate future loss bornhuetter ferguson method the bornhuetter ferguson method using premium and paid loss is combination of the paid development method and the expected loss ratio method where the weight given to each method is the reciprocal of the loss development factor this method normally determines expected loss ratio similar to the method used for the expected loss ratio method the bornhuetter ferguson method using premium and incurred loss is similar to the bornhuetter ferguson method using premium and paid loss except that it us case incurred loss aig form ktable of content item note to consolidated financial statement insurance liability cape cod method the cape cod method is mechanically similar to the bornhuetter ferguson method with the difference being that the expected loss ratio estimate are determined based on weighting of the loss estimate that come from the paid incurred development method this method may be more responsive to recent loss trend than the bornhuetter ferguson method average loss method the average loss method multiplies projected number of ultimate claim by an estimated ultimate severity average loss for each accident year to produce ultimate loss estimate since projection of the ultimate number of claim are often le variable than projection of ultimate loss this method can provide more reliable result for reserve category where loss development pattern are inconsistent or variable to be relied on exclusively in updating our loss reserve estimate we consider and evaluate input from many source including actual claim data the performance of prior reserve estimate observed industry trend our internal peer review process including challenge and recommendation from our enterprise risk management group well the view of third party actuarial firm we use these input to improve our evaluation technique and to analyze and ass the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year by product line our analysis produce range of indication from various method from which we select our best estimate in determining the actual carried loss reserve we consider both the internal actuarial best estimate and numerous other internal and external factor including an assessment of economic condition including real gdp

is an extremely long tail line of business with loss emergence extending for decade we generally use combination of loss development frequency severity and expected loss ratio method for worker compensation many of our primary casualty policy contain risk sharing feature including high deductible self insured retention or retrospective rating feature in addition to traditional insurance component these risk sharing program generally are large and complex comprising multiple product year and structure and are subject to amendment over time we group guaranteed cost and excess of deductible business separately and then further by state and industry subset to the extent that meaningful difference are determined to exist we also separately analyze certain subset of the portfolio that have unique characteristic government sub contractor account and construction wrap up business for excess of deductible business we also segment by size of deductible and whether the claim is handled by aig or an outside third party administrator tpa the proportion of large deductible business ha increased over time which ha slowed the reporting pattern of claim for guaranteed cost business expected loss ratio method generally are given significant weight only in the most recent accident year worker compensation claim are generally characterized by high frequency low severity and relatively consistent loss development from one accident year to the next we historically have been leading writer of worker compensation and thus have sufficient volume of claim experience to use development method we generally segregate california ca and new york ny business from the other state to reflect their different development pattern and changing percentage of the mix by state the claim development table above are impacted by two other significant initiative which offset each other in recent year we instituted claim strategy change and loss mitigation effort to accelerate settlement which we believe result in an overall reduction in claim cost this strategy resulted in an increase in paid loss along the latest diagonal relative to prior year in addition we have been reducing premium volume in recent year and shifting greater proportion of business to insured risk retention structure such high deductible policy these mix and volume change slowed paid and incurred development since excess of deductible claim will typically take longer to emerge and settle expected loss ratio method for business written in excess of deductible may be given significant weight in the most recent five accident year in the analysis we increased our tail factor estimate for state other than ny and ca for guaranteed cost business in recognition of longer medical development pattern that we have been seeing in recent year we reflected increase in legal cost we have seen across the portfolio particularly in california additionally over the year we have written number of

exposure are very long tailed in nature and with exposure dating back year or more we consider number of factor and recent experience in addition to the result of both external and internal analysis to estimate asbestos and pre environmental loss reserve we primarily base our determination of these loss reserve on combination of ground up and top down analysis of historical claim and available insurance coverage nonetheless we believe that significant uncertainty remains to our ultimate liability for asbestos and environmental claim which is due to several factor including the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation and pollution event occurring undetected over many year leading to the potential for involvement of multiple policy period for individual claim claim filed under the non aggregate premise or operation section of general liability policy the number of insured seeking bankruptcy protection and the effect of prepackaged bankruptcy diverging legal interpretation and the difficulty in estimating the allocation of remediation cost among various party with respect to environmental claim loss reserve for asbestos and environmental claim can not be estimated using conventional reserving technique such those that rely on historical accident year loss development factor the method used to determine asbestos and environmental loss estimate and to establish the resulting reserve are continually reviewed and updated by management excess worker compensationexcess worker compensation ha an extremely long tail and is one of the most challenging line of business from reserving perspective particularly when the excess coverage is provided above self insured retention layer the class is highly sensitive to small change in assumption for example in the rate of medical inflation or the longevity of injured worker which can have significant effect on the ultimate reserve cost estimate excess worker compensation business wa written over qualified self insurance by various division beginning in the in this business wa consolidated into one division where it continued writing business up until when it wa effectively put into runoff in this book of business the claim are not handled or administered by aig general insurance claim personnel but are administered by the client designated tpa however aig general insurance claim personnel maintain an oversight role over these tpas and claim loss and loss adjustment expense liability estimate for excess worker compensation exposure are subject to additional uncertainty due to the following claim settlement time is longer than most other casualty line due to the lifetime benefit that can be expected to payout on certain claim coverage statute that vary by state and future medical inflation cost are difficult to estimatefor this business combination of traditional method paid and incurred loss development and non traditional method individual claim annuity model report

decrease the pension expense by approximately million with all other item remaining the same basis point increase in the discount rate would increase the pension expense by approximately million this

valuation allowancethe evaluation of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and the need for valuation allowance requires to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified the more negative evidence that exists the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support conclusion that valuation allowance is not needed our framework for assessing the recoverability of the deferred tax asset requires to consider all available evidence including the nature frequency and amount of cumulative financial reporting income and loss in recent year the sustainability of recent operating profitability of our subsidiary the predictability of future operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset including forecast of future income for each of our business and actual and planned business and operational change the carryforward period for the net operating loss capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards including the effect of reversing taxable temporary difference and prudent and feasible action and tax planning strategy that would be implemented if necessary to protect against the loss of the deferred tax asset in performing our assessment of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset under this framework we consider tax law governing the utilization of the net operating loss capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards in each applicable jurisdiction under tax law company generally must use it net operating loss carryforwards before it can use it foreign tax credit carryforwards even though the carryforward period for the foreign tax credit is shorter than for the net operating loss our federal consolidated income tax group includes both life company and non life company while the taxable income of our non life company can be offset by our net operating loss carryforwards only portion no more than percent of the taxable income of our life company can be offset by those net operating loss carryforwards the remaining tax liability of our life company can be offset by the foreign tax credit carryforwards accordingly we utilize both the net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards concurrently which enables to realize our tax attribute prior to expiration of december based on all available evidence it is more likely than not that the net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards will be utilized prior to expiration and thus no valuation allowance ha been established estimate of future taxable income including income generated from prudent and feasible action and tax planning strategy and any change to interpretation and assumption related to the impact of the tax act could change in the near term perhaps materially which may require to consider any potential impact to our assessment of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset such potential impact could be material to our consolidated financial condition or result of operation for an individual reporting period aig form ktable of content item note to consolidated financial statement income tax for the year ended december recent change in

allowance associated with the unrealized tax loss in the life insurance company available for sale security portfolio all of which wa allocated to other comprehensive income we released the full amount of valuation allowance previously recorded during the three month period ended march and no additional activity wa recorded for the remainder of for the year ended december recent change in market condition including interest rate fluctuation impacted the unrealized tax gain and loss in the non life company available for sale security portfolio resulting in an increase to the deferred

at december and we had deferred tax asset valuation allowance of billion and billion respectively related to foreign subsidiary state and local tax jurisdiction and certain domestic subsidiary that file separate tax return we maintained these valuation allowance following our conclusion that we could not demonstrate that it wa more likely than not that the related deferred tax asset will be
