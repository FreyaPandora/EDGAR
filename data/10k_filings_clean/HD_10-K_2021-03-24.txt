accounting policiesour significant accounting policy are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statement the following discussion address our most critical accounting policy which are those that are both important to the representation of our financial condition and result of operation and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumption or complex estimate merchandise inventorieswe value the majority of our inventory under the retail inventory method using the first in first out method with the remainder of our inventory valued under cost method under the retail inventory method inventory are stated at cost which is determined by applying cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventory the retail value of our inventory is adjusted needed to reflect current market condition because these adjustment are based on current prevailing market condition the value of our inventory approximates the lower of cost or market the valuation under the retail inventory method is based on number of factor such markup markdowns and inventory loss or shrink such there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inventory cost and gross profit we determine markup and markdowns based on the consideration of variety of factor such current and anticipated demand customer preference and buying trend age of the merchandise and weather condition we calculate shrink based on actual inventory loss identified result of physical inventory count during each fiscal period and estimated inventory loss between physical inventory count the estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inventory count is calculated on store specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink result due to change in operating condition during fiscal result of the covid pandemic we used the result from sample of store that were able to conduct physical inventory basis for estimating shrink for those store at which physical inventory count were temporarily suspended during the year we believe the sample of store that were selected for inventory count in the current year provides reasonable basis for estimating shrink where physical inventory count wa not performed in fiscal historically the difference between estimated shrink and actual inventory loss ha not been material to our annual financial result we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood for material change in the estimate or assumption we use to value our inventory under the retail inventory method we believe that the retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation which approximates cost and result in valuing our inventory at the lower of cost or market of contentsimpairment of long lived assetswe evaluate our long lived asset each quarter for indicator of potential impairment indicator of impairment include current period loss combined with history of loss our decision to relocate or close store or other location before the end of it previously estimated useful life or when change in other circumstance indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation for long lived asset is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flow which is generally the individual store level the asset of store with indicator of impairment are evaluated for recoverability by comparing their undiscounted future cash flow with their carrying value our cash flow projection look several year into the future and include assumption of variable such future sale and operating margin growth rate economic condition market competition and inflation if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flow we then measure the asset fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized if the resulting fair value is le than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized we generally base our estimate of fair market value on market appraisal of owned location and estimate of the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased location impairment of long lived asset were not material to our consolidated financial statement in fiscal fiscal or fiscal uncertain tax position we are subject to income tax in the united state and in multiple jurisdiction across our global operation thus the determination of our provision for income tax requires significant judgment the use of estimate and the interpretation and application of complex tax law our provision for income tax could be affected by many factor including change in business operation change in tax law outcome of income tax audit change in our assessment of certain tax contingency the impact of discrete tax item and the mix of earnings among our and foreign operation the calculation of our tax liability involves dealing with complexity and thus there are many transaction and calculation for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the assessment of uncertain tax position requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax position and assessing the timing and amount of deductible and taxable item we record the benefit of uncertain tax position in our financial statement only after determining more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax position will be sustained business combinationswe account for business combination using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control is obtained all the asset acquired and liability assumed are recorded at their respective fair value at the date of acquisition the determination of fair value of identifiable asset and liability requires estimate and the use of valuation technique when market value is not readily available and requires

subsidiary including retail operation in canada and mexico and distribution center record merchandise inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by cost method these merchandise

inventory count or cycle count are taken on regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amount reflected in merchandise inventory are properly stated shrink or in the case of

inventory count during each fiscal period and estimated inventory loss between physical inventory count the estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inventory count is calculated on store specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink result due to change in operating condition during fiscal result of the covid pandemic we used the result from sample of store that were able to conduct physical inventory basis for estimating shrink for those store at which physical inventory count were temporarily suspended during the year we believe the sample of store that were selected for inventory count in the current year provides reasonable basis for estimating shrink where physical inventory count wa not performed in fiscal historically the difference between estimated shrink and actual inventory loss ha not been material to our annual financial result property and equipmentbuildings furniture fixture and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful life leasehold improvement are amortized using the straight line method over the original term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement whichever is shorter the estimated useful life of our property and equipment follow yearsfurniture fixture and yearsleasehold yearswe capitalize certain cost including interest related

quarter for indicator of potential impairment indicator of impairment include current period loss combined with history of loss our decision to relocate or close store or other location before the end of it previously estimated useful life or when change in other circumstance indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation for long lived asset is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flow which is generally the individual store level the asset of store with indicator of impairment are evaluated for recoverability by comparing it undiscounted future cash flow with it carrying value if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flow we then measure the asset fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized if the resulting fair value is le than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value impairment loss on property and equipment are recorded component of sg impairment charge for long lived asset were not material to our consolidated financial statement in fiscal fiscal or fiscal of contentsleaseson february we adopted the new lease standard using the modified retrospective transition method we enter into contractual arrangement for the utilization of certain non owned asset which are evaluated finance or operating lease upon commencement and are accounted for accordingly specifically contract is or contains lease when the contract contains an explicitly or implicitly identified asset and we obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of that underlying asset and direct how and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the contract in exchange for consideration we ass whether an arrangement is or contains lease at inception of the contract we lease certain retail location warehouse and distribution space office space equipment and vehicle substantial majority of our lease have remaining lease term of one to year typically with the option to extend the lease for five year term some of our lease may include the option to terminate in le than five year the lease term used to calculate the right of use asset and lease liability at commencement includes the impact of option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option when determining whether it is reasonably certain that we will exercise an option at commencement we consider various existing economic factor including market condition real estate strategy the nature length and term of the agreement well the uncertainty of the condition of leased equipment at the end of the lease term based on these determination we generally conclude that the exercise of renewal option would not be reasonably certain in determining the lease term at commencement the discount rate used to calculate the present value of lease payment is the rate implicit in the lease when readily determinable the rate implicit in the lease is rarely readily determinable we use secured incremental borrowing rate which is updated on quarterly basis the discount rate for the present value of lease payment real estate tax insurance maintenance and operating expense applicable to the leased property are generally our obligation under our lease agreement in instance where these payment are fixed they are included in the measurement of our lease liability and when variable are excluded and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payment is incurred certain of our lease agreement also include rental payment based on an index or rate and others include rental payment based on percentage of sale for variable payment dependent upon an index or rate we apply the active index or rate of the lease commencement date variable lease payment not based on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of our lease liability they can not be reasonably estimated and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payment is incurred lease that have term of twelve month or le upon commencement are considered short term in nature accordingly short term lease are not included on the consolidated balance sheet and are expensed on straight line basis over the lease term we have also elected to not separate lease and non lease component for certain class of asset including real estate and certain equipment our lease agreement do not contain any material residual value guarantee or material restrictive covenant business combinationsthe asset and liability of acquired business are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the fair value

excess of purchase price over the fair value of net asset acquired we do not amortize goodwill but ass the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year or more often if indicator warrant by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit support it carrying value each fiscal year we may ass qualitative factor to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is le than it carrying amount basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessment with quantitative assessment completed at least once every three year we completed our last quantitative assessment in fiscal and concluded that the fair value of our reporting unit substantially exceeded their respective carrying value including goodwill during the third quarter of fiscal we completed our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill for our canada and mexico reporting unit based on qualitative factor part of this analysis we assessed the current environment to determine if there were any indicator of impairment result of the operating condition of contentsresulting from covid or otherwise
