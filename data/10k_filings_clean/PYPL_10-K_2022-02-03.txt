estimate and assumption about certain item and future event that directly affect our reported financial condition we have established detailed policy and control procedure to provide reasonable assurance that the method used to make estimate and assumption are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the accounting estimate and assumption discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statement an accounting estimate or assumption is considered critical if both the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved and the impact within reasonable range of outcome of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition management ha discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimate with the audit risk and compliance committee of our board of director our significant accounting policy including recent accounting

where information is available to reasonably estimate the impact and provides material information to investor the amount used to ass sensitivity are included to allow user of this report to understand general directional cause and effect of change in the estimate and do not represent management prediction of variability for all these estimate it should be noted that future event rarely develop exactly forecasted and such estimate require regular review and adjustment allowance for transaction and credit lossestransaction and credit loss include the expense associated with our customer protection program fraud chargebacks and credit loss associated with our loan receivable balance our transaction and credit loss fluctuate depending on many factor including total tpv product mix current and projected macroeconomic condition including unemployment rate merchant insolvency event change to and usage of our customer protection program the impact of regulatory change and the credit quality of loan receivable arising from transaction funded with our credit product which include revolving and installment credit product offered to consumer at checkout and merchant loan and advance arising from the paypal working capital ppwc and paypal business loan ppbl product we establish allowance for negative customer balance and estimated transaction loss arising from processing customer transaction such chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchant related chargebacks due to non delivery or unsatisfactory delivery of purchased item buyer protection program claim account takeover and automated clearing house return addition to the allowance in the form of provision are reflected in transaction and credit loss on our consolidated statement of income the allowance are based on known fact and circumstance internal factor including experience with similar case historical trend involving collection and write off pattern and the mix of transaction and loss type well current and projected macroeconomic factor appropriate of contentswe also establish an allowance for loan and interest receivable which represents our estimate of current expected credit loss inherent in our portfolio of loan and interest receivable this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimate and judgment the allowance is primarily based on expectation of credit loss based on historical lifetime loss data well macroeconomic forecast applied to the portfolio which is segmented by factor such geographic region delinquency and vintage loss curve are generated using historical loss data for each loan portfolio and are applied to segment of each portfolio categorized by factor such geographic region first borrowing versus repeat borrowing delinquency credit rating and vintage which vary by portfolio we then apply macroeconomic factor such forecasted trend in unemployment and benchmark credit card charge off rate which are sourced externally using single scenario that we believe is most appropriate to the economic condition applicable to particular period we utilize externally sourced macroeconomic scenario data to supplement our historical information due to the limited period in which our credit product offering have been in existence projected loss rate inclusive of historical loss data and macroeconomic factor are applied to the principal amount of our consumer and merchant receivables we also include qualitative adjustment that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimate of our current expected credit loss our consumer receivables consist of revolving product which do not have contractual term and installment product the reasonable and supportable forecast period for revolving product installment product and merchant product that we have included in our projected loss rate which approximates the estimated life of the loan is approximately year approximately month to year and approximately to year respectively in the reasonable and supportable forecast period for revolving consumer product wa based only on externally sourced data due to the lack of availability of historical data and in it wa updated to reflect historical loss experience with the portfolio the allowance for current expected credit loss on interest and fee receivable is determined primarily by applying loss curve to each portfolio by geography delinquency and period of origination among other factor determining appropriate current expected credit loss allowance for loan and interest receivable is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate loss may vary from the current estimate we regularly update our allowance estimate new fact become known and event occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of loss the allowance are maintained at level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for current expected credit loss at the balance sheet date after incorporating the impact of externally sourced macroeconomic forecast these forecast project scenario such future unemployment and benchmark credit card charge off rate of december we utilized externally published projection of the and forecasted unemployment rate over the reasonable and supportable forecast period of december we utilized externally published projection of the forecasted credit card charge off rate and forecasted unemployment rate over the reasonable and supportable forecast period the overall principal and interest coverage ratio of december and wa approximately and respectively significant change in the forecasted macroeconomic factor could result in material change in our allowance our allowance of december took into account continued volatility with respect to macroeconomic condition and uncertainty around the financial health of our merchant borrower including uncertainty around the effectiveness of loan modification program made available to merchant our allowance of december took into account for the proactive and reactive measure that we took to help reduce financial difficulty experienced by our customer limitation in our expected credit loss model that arose due to the extreme fluctuation in both the actual and forecasted macroeconomic condition in the period varying degree of merchant performance in the current environment well expected future performance and to account for payment holiday granted we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of these action which may result in adjustment to our allowance for loan and interest receivable in future period an increase of in the principal and interest coverage ratio would increase our allowance by approximately million based on the loan and interest receivable balance outstanding of december accounting for income tax our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rate and tax planning opportunity available to in the various jurisdiction in which we operate tax law are complex and subject to different interpretation by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authority significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax position including evaluating uncertainty we review our tax position quarterly and adjust the balance new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate that apply to our foreign earnings in addition to local country tax law and regulation our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the through provision such the gilti tax and base

contentsdeferred tax asset represent amount available to reduce income tax payable on taxable income in future year such asset arise because of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability well from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deduction and credit by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategy these source of income rely heavily on estimate that are based on number of factor including our historical experience and short range and long range business forecast to the extent deferred tax asset are not expected to be realized we record valuation allowance we recognize and measure uncertain tax position in accordance with gaap pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement from such position are then measured based on the largest benefit that ha greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we report liability for unrecognized tax benefit resulting from uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return gaap further requires that change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax position be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs we recognize interest and penalty if any related to unrecognized tax benefit in income tax expense we file annual income tax return in multiple taxing jurisdiction around the world number of year may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authority and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our reserve for income tax are adequate such that we reflect the benefit more likely than not to be sustained in an examination we adjust these reserve well the related interest and penalty where appropriate in light of changing fact and circumstance settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash based on our result for the year ended december one percentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately million loss contingencieswe are currently involved in various claim regulatory and legal proceeding and investigation of potential operating violation by regulatory oversight authority we regularly review the status of each significant matter and ass our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim legal proceeding or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we accrue liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgment are subjective and are based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceeding the merit of our defense and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel because of uncertainty related to these matter accrual are based on the best information available at the time additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claim litigation or other violation and may revise our estimate due to the inherent uncertainty of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdiction in which we operate our judgment may differ materially from the actual outcome revenue recognitionapplication of the accounting principle in gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires to make judgment and estimate complex arrangement with nonstandard term and condition may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting specifically the determination of whether we are principal to transaction gross revenue or an agent net revenue can require considerable judgment further we provide incentive payment to consumer and merchant evaluating whether these incentive are payment to customer or consideration payable on behalf of customer requires judgment incentive determined to be made to customer or payable on behalf of customer are recorded reduction to gross revenue change in judgment with respect to these assumption and estimate could impact the amount of revenue recognized valuation of goodwill and intangiblesthe valuation of asset acquired in business combination require the use of significant estimate and assumption the acquisition method of accounting for business combination requires to estimate the fair value of asset acquired

investment portfolio would have decreased by approximately million and million at december and respectively of december we had billion in fixed rate debt with varying maturity date since these note bear interest at fixed rate they do not result in any financial statement risk associated with change in interest rate however the fair value of these note fluctuates when interest rate change of december we also had revolving credit facility of approximately billion available to we are obligated to pay interest on borrowing under these facility well other customary fee including an upfront fee and an unused commitment fee based on our debt rating borrowing under these facility if any bear interest at floating rate result we are exposed to the risk related to fluctuation in interest rate to the extent of our borrowing of december we had approximately million outstanding under these credit facility no amount were outstanding of december for additional information see note debt in the note to the consolidated financial statement included in this form interest rate may also adversely impact our customer spending level and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amount owed to higher interest rate often lead to larger payment obligation by customer of our credit product to or to lender under mortgage credit card and other consumer and merchant loan which may reduce our customer ability to remain current on their obligation to and therefore lead to increased delinquency charge offs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income foreign currency exchange rate riskwe have significant operation internationally that are denominated in foreign currency primarily the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting to foreign currency exchange rate risk which may adversely impact our financial result we transact business in various foreign currency and have significant international revenue and

intercompany balance that are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation may differ materially from expectation and we may record significant gain or loss due to foreign currency fluctuation and related hedging activity we are generally net receiver of foreign currency and therefore benefit from weakening of the united state dollar and are adversely affected by strengthening of the dollar relative to foreign currency we have foreign currency exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposure manage these exposure and reduce the potential effect of currency fluctuation on our consolidated cash flow and result of operation through the execution of foreign currency exchange contract these foreign currency exchange contract are

investment hedge for accounting purpose the derivative gain or loss is initially reported component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci cash flow hedge are subsequently reclassified into the financial statement line item in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the forecasted transaction affect earnings the accumulated gain and loss associated with the net investment hedge will remain in aoci until the foreign subsidiary is sold or substantially liquidated at which point they will be reclassified into earnings we considered the historical trend in foreign currency exchange rate and determined that it wa reasonably possible that change in exchange rate of for all currency could be experienced in the near term if the dollar weakened by at december and the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign currency exchange forward contract before tax would have been approximately billion and billion lower respectively if the dollar strengthened by at december and

adverse change in exchange rate of for all currency would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income tax of approximately million and million at december and respectively without considering the offsetting effect of foreign currency exchange contract foreign currency exchange contract in place of december would have positively impacted income before income tax by approximately

region delinquency and vintage loss curve are generated using historical loss data for each loan portfolio and are applied to segment of each portfolio categorized by factor such geographic region first borrowing versus repeat borrowing delinquency credit rating and vintage which vary by portfolio we then apply macroeconomic factor such forecasted trend in unemployment and benchmark credit card charge off rate which are sourced externally using single scenario that we believe is most appropriate to the economic condition applicable to particular period we utilize externally sourced macroeconomic scenario data to supplement our historical information due to the limited period in which our credit product offering have been in existence projected loss rate inclusive of historical loss data and macroeconomic factor are applied to the principal amount of our consumer and merchant receivables we also include qualitative adjustment that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimate of our current expected credit loss our consumer receivables consist of revolving product which do not have contractual term and installment product the reasonable and supportable forecast period for revolving product installment product and merchant product that we have included in our projected loss rate which approximates the estimated life of the loan is approximately year approximately month to year and approximately to year respectively in the reasonable and supportable forecast period for revolving consumer product wa based only on externally sourced data due to the lack of availability of historical data and in it wa updated to reflect historical loss experience with the portfolio this change did not result in material impact to the reserve the allowance for current expected credit loss on interest and fee receivable is determined primarily by applying loss curve to each portfolio by geography delinquency and period of origination among other factor prior to january the allowance for our consumer loan receivable wa primarily based on forecasted principal balance delinquency rate roll rate roll rate are the percentage of balance which we estimate would migrate from one stage of delinquency to the next based on our historical experience well external factor such estimated bankruptcy and level of unemployment roll rate were applied to the principal amount of our consumer receivables for each stage of delinquency from current to day past the payment due date to estimate the principal loan which had incurred loss and were probable to be charged off for merchant loan and advance receivable the allowance wa primarily based on principal balance forecasted delinquency rate and recovery through the use of vintage based loss forecasting model the determination of delinquency from current to day past due for principal balance related to merchant receivables outstanding wa based on the current expected or contractual repayment period of the loan or advance and interest or fixed fee compared to the original expected or contractual repayment period the allowance for loss against interest receivable wa primarily determined by applying historical average customer account roll rate to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to project the value of account that had incurred loss and were probable to be charged off the allowance for fee receivable wa primarily based on fee balance forecasted delinquency rate and recovery through the use of vintage based loss
