which marketing approval is sought or ha been obtained based on demonstration that it is biosimilar to the original reference product see government regulation we may also compete biosimilar or generic version of our competitor product in the eu we continue to face competition from biosimilars in the united state patent expiration we expect to face greater competition than today including from manufacturer with biosimilars approved in europe which may seek to obtain approval of our product compete with each other for example aranesp and epogen compete in the united state primarily in the dialysis setting neulasta competes with neupogen neulasta is administered single dose per chemotherapy cycle while neupogen requires more frequent dosing neupogen sale have been adversely impacted by conversion to neulasta which we believe is substantially complete the introduction of new product the development of new process or technology by competitor or the emergence of new information about existing product may result in increased competition for our marketed product even for those protected by patent or in reduction of the price that we receive from selling our product in addition

product are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third party payer in the united state healthcare provider are reimbursed for covered service and product use through medicare medicaid and other government healthcare program well through private payer we are required to provide specified rebate or discount to certain of these government funded program for many year federal and state government in the united state have pursued method to reduce the cost of these program for example in the united state enacted major healthcare reform legislation known the patient protection and affordable care act or aca that significant impact which include requirement to offer discount for medicare part drug in the coverage gap an increase in the rebate we pay for our that are covered and reimbursed by state medicaid program requirement to pay rebate on medicaid managed care utilization the expansion of entity eligible for discount under the drug pricing program and new fee the healthcare reform federal excise fee on branded prescription pharmaceutical manufacturer and importer bpd fee such change have had and are expected to continue to have material adverse impact on our business at present medicare payment rate are affected by across the board federal budget cut commonly referred to sequestration under sequestration the center for medicare medicaid service cm the federal agency responsible for administering medicare and medicaid reduced medicare payment to provider by beginning in in addition in the effort to contain the federal deficit our industry could be considered potential source of saving via legislative proposal that have been debated but not enacted it remains uncertain to proposal if any may be included part of future federal budget deficit reduction action that would directly or indirectly affect and our business particular legislative and regulatory development that would have significant impact on amgen include change to the medicare program cover and reimburses current and future drug for patient with end stage renal disease esrd including sensipar change in the payment rate or new rebate requirement for covered drug which could impact many of our principal product including aranesp neulasta neupogen prolia and xgeva and policy for payment and coverage of biosimilars effort are also made in the private sector to reduce healthcare cost notably by healthcare payer and provider which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measure we expect insurer and provider to continue effort to reduce the cost and or utilization of healthcare product including our product these measure include consolidation of insurer in the united state and the emergence of large integrated insurer provider delivery network to consolidate purchasing and negotiating power generally in country outside the united state government sponsored healthcare system are the primary payer for drug and biologics with increased budgetary constraint payer in many country employ variety of measure to exert downward price pressure these measure can include mandatory price control price referencing therapeutic reference pricing increasing mandate or incentive for generic substitution and biosimilar usage and government mandated price cut in addition healthcare reform and related legislative proposal in such country france germany and poland well austerity plan in number of country including spain greece italy ireland and portugal have targeted the pharmaceutical sector with multiple mechanism to reduce government healthcare expenditure we expect that country will continue to take aggressive action to reduce expenditure on drug and biologics similarly fiscal constraint may also impact the extent to which country are willing to approve new innovative therapy and or allow access to new technology for example many health technology assessment hta organization use formal economic metric such cost effectiveness to determine coverage and reimbursement of new therapy and these organization are proliferating in established and emerging market see item risk factor our sale

long approximately to year from discovery to market potential new medicine must undergo many year of preclinical and clinical testing to establish it safety and efficacy for use in human at appropriate dosing level and with an acceptable benefit risk profile after laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animal we file an investigational new drug application ind with the fda to begin human testing typically we undertake an fda designated three phase human clinical testing program in phase we conduct small clinical trial to investigate the safety and proper dose range of our product candidate in small number of human subject in phase we conduct clinical trial to investigate side effect profile and the efficacy of our product candidate in larger number of patient who have the disease or condition under study in phase we conduct clinical trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of our product candidate in large number of patient who have the disease or condition under study the fda monitor the progress of each trial conducted under an ind and may at it discretion evaluate alter suspend or terminate the testing based on the data accumulated to that point and

drug application for small molecule product we can not market or promote new product until our marketing application ha been approved by the fda see item risk factor for discussion of the factor that could adversely impact our development of commercial product approval of biosimilars the aca authorized the fda to approve biosimilars via separate abbreviated pathway in many case this allows biosimilars to be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trial typically required of originator the law establishes period of year of data exclusivity for reference product in order to preserve incentive for future innovation and outline statutory criterion for science based biosimilar approval standard that take into account patient safety consideration under this framework data exclusivity protects the data in the innovator regulatory application by prohibiting others for period of year from gaining fda approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the innovator data in their application to the fda the law not change the duration of patent granted on biologic product since february the fda ha released six draft guidance document part of the implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars and these have not yet been finalized in early february the fda released it planned agenda for which included the possible publication of new draft guidance document relating to biosimilar interchangeability and biosimilars labeling four manufacturer have announced the filing of five separate marketing application to the fda under the biosimilar pathway these marketing application include two for filgrastim one for pegfilgrastim and one for epoetin alfa which if approved would compete with our neupogen neulasta and epogen product respectively of the end of no biosimilar application had been approved by the fda in january sandoz novartis company announced that the fda odac recommended approval of it investigational biosimilar filgrastim for use in all indication included in the reference product neupogen label regulation of product marketing and promotion the fda regulates the marketing and promotion of product our product promotion for approved product indication must comply with the statutory standard of the fdca and the fda implementing regulation and standard the fda review of marketing and promotional activity encompasses but is not limited to direct to consumer advertising healthcare provider directed advertising and promotion sale representative communication to healthcare professional promotional programming and promotional activity involving the internet the fda may also review industry sponsored scientific and educational activity that make representation regarding product safety or efficacy in promotional context the fda may take enforcement action against company for promoting unapproved us of product or for other violation of it advertising and labeling law and regulation enforcement action may include product seizure injunction civil or criminal penalty or regulatory letter which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communication to healthcare professional failure to comply with the fda regulation also can result in adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of company activity by the congress or other legislator additionally described such failure may lead to additional liability under health care fraud and abuse law regulation of manufacturing standard the fda regulates and inspects equipment facility laboratory and process used in the manufacturing and testing of product prior to providing approval to market product if after receiving approval from the fda we make material change in manufacturing equipment location or process additional regulatory review may be required we also must adhere to current good manufacturing practice regulation and product specific regulation enforced by fda through it facility inspection program the fda conduct regular periodic visit to re inspect our equipment facility laboratory and process following an initial approval if the fda determines that we no longer comply with applicable regulation and condition of approval they may seek civil criminal or administrative sanction and or remedy against including suspension of our manufacturing operation such issue may also delay the approval of new product undergoing fda review regulation of combination product combination product are defined by the fda to include product comprised of two or more regulated component biologic and or drug and device biologics drug and device each have their own regulatory requirement and combination product may have additional requirement number of our marketed product meet this definition and are regulated under this framework and we expect that number of our pipeline product candidate will be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework well regulation outside the united statesin the eu country switzerland canada australia and japan regulatory requirement and approval process are similar in principle to those in the united state in the eu depending on the type of drug for which approval is sought there are currently two potential track for marketing approval including decentralized and centralized procedure in the decentralized procedure identical application for marketing authorization are submitted simultaneously to the national regulatory agency the application is assessed by an initial national agency reference member state and those of chosen country concerned member state regulatory review is led by the reference member state and acknowledged by the concerned member state leading to single approval in all relevant country in the centralized procedure which is required of all product derived from biotechnology company submits single maa to the ema which conduct thorough product evaluation drawing from it scientific resource across europe if the drug product is proven to fulfill the requirement for quality safety and efficacy the committee for medicinal product for human use chmp adopts positive opinion which is transmitted to the european commission ec for final approval of the marketing authorization subsequent commercialization is enabled by country by country reimbursement approval while the ec generally follows the chmp opinion it is not bound to do in japan additional local clinical trial may be required part of the drug registration process which can add to the drug registration timeline in the eu biosimilars have been approved under specialized pathway of the centralized procedure the pathway allows sponsor of biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the non clinical and clinical trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar ha been demonstrated to be similar the relevance of demonstrating similarity is that it allows biosimilars to be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trial typically required of originator product benefit risk ha previously been established emerging marketsother country such russia turkey and those in latin america and the middle east have review process and data requirement similar to those of the eu and in some case rely on prior marketing approval from united state or eu regulatory authority the regulatory process in these country includes manufacturing testing facility inspection testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirement in asia number of country such china south korea and taiwan may require local clinical trial part of the drug registration process in addition to the global clinical trial which can add to the drug registration timeline in most asian market registration timeline are dependent on marketing approval in the united state or eu however in some emerging market in asia such china the regulatory landscape is evolving and the regulatory timeline can be le predictable post approval phaseafter approval we continue to monitor adverse event reported following the use of our product through post marketing routine pharmacovigilance surveillance and study when applicable we report such event to the appropriate regulatory agency required per local regulation for individual case and aggregate report we proactively monitor according to good pharmacovigilance practice and ensure the implementation of signal detection assessment and communication of adverse event that may be associated with the use of our product

modality for the year ended december and our expense billion billion and billion respectively we have major center in several location throughout the united state and in the united kingdom well smaller research center and development facility globally see item property we conduct clinical trial activity using both our internal staff and third party contract clinical trial service provider to increase the number of patient available for enrollment in our clinical trial we have opened clinical site and will continue to open clinical site and to enroll patient in number of geographic location see government regulation clinical development and product approval for discussion of government regulation over clinical development also see item risk factor we must conduct clinical trial in human before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidate or existing product for new indication some of our competitor are actively engaged in in area where we have product or where we are developing product candidate or new indication for existing product for example we compete with other clinical trial for eligible patient which may limit the number of available patient who meet the criterion for certain clinical trial the competitive marketplace for our product candidate is significantly dependent on the timing of entry into the market early entry may have important advantage in gaining product acceptance thereby contributing to the product eventual success and profitability accordingly we expect that in some case the relative speed with which we can develop product complete clinical testing receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantity of the product to the market will be important to our competitive position in addition to product candidate and marketed product generated from our internal effort we acquire company acquire and license certain product and technology right and establish arrangement with third party to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our capability product pipeline and marketed product base in pursuing these arrangement and licensing or acquisition activity we face competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology company that also seek to license or acquire technology product candidate or marketed product from those entity performing the the following

expectation estimate forecast and projection about our future performance our business our belief and our management assumption these statement are not guarantee of future performance and involve certain risk uncertainty and assumption that are difficult to predict should carefully consider the risk and uncertainty facing our business the risk described below are not the only one facing our business is also subject to the risk that affect many other company such employment relation general economic condition geopolitical event and international operation further additional risk not currently known to or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business operation liquidity and stock price our current product and product in development can not be sold without regulatory approval our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authority in the united state including the fda and by foreign regulatory authority including the ema we are required in the united state and in foreign country to obtain approval from regulatory authority before we can manufacture market and sell our product approved the fda and other and foreign regulatory agency have substantial authority to require additional testing perform inspection change product labeling or mandate withdrawal of our product failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirement may subject to administrative and or judicially imposed sanction the sanction could include the fda or foreign regulatory authority refusal to approve pending application delay in obtaining or withdrawal of approval delay or suspension of clinical trial warning letter product recall product seizure total or partial suspension of our operation injunction fine civil penalty and or criminal prosecution obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval ha been and will continue to be increasingly difficult time consuming and costly there may be situation in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to comparative product can be shown also legislative body or regulatory agency could enact new law or regulation or change existing law or regulation at any time which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our product or product candidate for example the eu recently finalized legislation which will apply early mid related to the conduct of clinical trial while the aim of the new legislation is improvement in operational efficiency and streamlining of the overall clinical trial authorization process the new requirement also provide for increased transparency of clinical trial result and submission of quality data relating to the product and product candidate used for such trial starting in the ema will make certain clinical trial report publicly available which may limit our ability to protect competitively sensitive information contained in our clinical trial report failure to comply with new law or regulation could result in significant monetary penalty well reputational and other harm we are unable to predict when and whether any further change to law or regulatory policy affecting our business could occur such effort to reform medical device regulation or the pedigree requirement for medical product or to implement new requirement for combination product and whether such change could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation regulatory authority may also question the sufficiency for approval of the endpoint we select for our clinical trial for example question remain about regulatory authority view regarding the adequacy for approval of therapeutic oncology product that have demonstrated statistically significant improvement in endpoint such pfs or durable response rate drr but have not shown statistically significant improvement in overall survival number of our product and product candidate have been evaluated in clinical trial using endpoint other than overall survival such pfs drr and bone metastasis free survival bmfs the use of endpoint such pfs drr or bmfs in the absence of other measure of clinical benefit may not be sufficient for approval even when such result are statistically significant regulatory authority could also add new requirement such the completion of an outcome study or meaningful portion of an outcome study condition for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication the imposition of additional requirement may delay our clinical development and regulatory filing and delay or prevent from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidate new indication for existing product or maintenance of our current label some of our product are approved by and foreign regulatory authority on conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirement of regulator for example in july our subsidiary onyx pharmaceutical received accelerated approval for kyprolis in the united state with full approval conditioned on conducting additional clinical trial of the use of kyprolis therapy in treating multiple myeloma regulatory authority are placing greater focus on monitoring product originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsor of such product have met the condition of the accelerated or conditional approval if we are unable to fulfill the requirement of regulator that were condition of our product accelerated or conditional approval and or if regulator re evaluate the data or risk benefit profile of our product in connection with renewal assessment our conditional approval may be revoked or not renewed or we may not receive full approval for these product or may be required to change the product labeled indication or even withdraw the product from the market safety problem or signal can arise our product and product candidate are evaluated in clinical trial including investigator sponsored study or our marketed product are used in clinical practice we are required to continuously collect and ass adverse event reported to and to communicate to regulatory agency these adverse event and safety signal regarding our product regulatory agency periodically perform inspection of our pharmacovigilance process including our adverse event reporting in pharmacovigilance legislation became effective in the eu that enhanced the authority of european regulator to require company to conduct additional post approval clinical efficacy and safety study and increased the requirement on sponsor company to analyze and evaluate the risk benefit profile of their product if regulatory agency determine that we or other party including our clinical trial investigator or licensee of our product have not complied with the applicable reporting or other pharmacovigilance requirement we may become subject to additional inspection warning letter or other enforcement action including monetary fine marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalty our product candidate and marketed product can also be affected by safety problem or signal occurring with respect to product that are similar to and that implicate an entire class of product further result of clinical trial including sub analysis or meta analysis of earlier clinical trial meta analysis involves the use of various statistical method to combine result from previous separate but related study performed by or others concern may arise about the sufficiency of the data or study underlying product approved label such actual or perceived safety problem or concern can lead to revised or restrictive labeling for our product requirement of risk management activity or other regulatory agency compliance action related to the promotion and sale of our product mandated post marketing commitment or pharmacovigilance program for our approved product product recall of our approved product revocation of approval for our product from the market completely or within particular therapeutic area or patient type increased timeline or delay in being approved by the fda or other regulatory body and or fewer treatment or product candidate being approved by regulatory body for example beginning in adverse safety result involving esas were observed and since that time our esas have been the subject of ongoing review and scrutiny review by regulatory authority of the risk benefit profile of esas ha resulted in change to esa labeling and usage in both the oncology and nephrology clinical setting in addition to our innovative product we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar version of nine product currently manufactured marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical company see item business research and development and selected product candidate amgen development of biosimilars in many market there is not yet legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars in the united state the aca provided for such pathway while the fda is working to implement it significant question remain to how product will be approved under the pathway see we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars delay or uncertainty in the development of such pathway could result in delay or difficulty in getting our product approved by regulatory authority subject to unanticipated development cost or otherwise reduce the value of the investment we have made in the biosimilars area additionally biosimilar product may be subject to patent dispute resolution and or patent infringement litigation which could delay or prevent the commercial launch of product of our product are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic device which have their own regulatory manufacturing and other risk some of our product or product candidate may be used in combination with drug delivery device such an injector or other delivery system our product candidate or expanded indication of our product used with such drug delivery device may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if such device do not gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance where approval of the product and device is sought under single marketing drug application the increased complexity of the review process may also delay receipt of regulatory approval in addition some of these drug delivery device may be provided by single source unaffiliated third party company we are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third party company both to supply the device and in some case to conduct the study required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agency we are also dependent on those third party company continuing to meet the applicable regulatory and other requirement to maintain that approval or clearance once it ha been received failure to successfully develop or supply the device delay in or failure of the amgen or third party study or failure of amgen or the third party company to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the device could result in increased development cost delay in or failure to obtain regulatory approval and or associated delay in product candidate reaching the market or the expansion of existing product label for new indication loss of regulatory approval or clearance of device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market further failure to successfully develop supply or gain or maintain approval for these device could adversely affect sale of the related approved product similarly some of our product or product candidate may be used in combination with an in vitro companion diagnostic device such test kit in some case our product candidate or expanded indication of our product used with in vitro companion diagnostic device may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if such device do not gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance with drug delivery device used with our product our ability to get and maintain the necessary regulatory approval for our product or product candidate used with in vitro companion diagnostic device can be substantially dependent on whether the manufacturer of such device meet their contractual responsibility to and or their obligation to regulatory authority failure by these manufacturer can also result in the significant delay and added cost described above or even result in the removal of our product from the market we may not be able to develop commercial product amgen invests heavily in successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain and very few project produce commercial product product candidate including biosimilar product candidate or new indication for existing product collectively product candidate that appear promising in the early phase of development may fail to reach the market for number of reason such the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial result even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial result for reason that could include change in the standard of care of medicine the product candidate wa not effective or more effective than currently available therapy in treating specified condition or illness the product candidate is not cost effective in light of existing therapeutic the product candidate had harmful side effect in human or animal the necessary regulatory body such the fda or ema did not approve our product candidate for an intended use the product candidate wa not economical for to manufacture and commercialize the biosimilar product candidate fails to demonstrate the requisite biosimilarity to the applicable reference product or is otherwise determined to be unacceptable for purpose of safety or efficacy to gain approval other party have or may have proprietary right relating to our product candidate such patent right and will not let sell it on reasonable term or at all we and certain of our licensee partner or independent investigator may fail to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activity and the regulatory pathway to approval for product candidate is uncertain or not well defined several of our product candidate have failed or been discontinued at various stage in the product development process inability to bring product to market or significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of new product for any of the reason discussed could potentially have negative impact on our net sale and earnings and could result in significant impairment of in process research and development ipr or other intangible asset must conduct clinical trial in human before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidate or existing product for new indication before we can sell any product we must conduct clinical trial to demonstrate that our product candidate are safe and effective for use in human the result of those clinical trial are used the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authority such the fda and ema see our current product and product in development can not be sold without regulatory approval we are required to conduct clinical trial using an appropriate number of trial site and patient to support the product label claim the length of time number of trial site and patient required for clinical trial vary substantially and therefore we may spend several year and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trial we may have difficulty finding sufficient number of clinical trial site and subject to participate in our clinical trial particularly if competitor are conducting clinical trial in similar patient population delay in planned clinical trial can result in increased development cost delay in regulatory approval associated delay in product candidate reaching the market and revision to existing product label in addition in order to increase the number of patient available for enrollment for our clinical trial we have and will continue to open clinical site and enroll patient in number of new geographic location where our experience conducting clinical trial is more limited including russia india china south korea the philippine singapore and some central and south american country either through utilization of third party contract clinical trial provider entirely or in combination with local staff conducting clinical trial in location where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resource to identify and understand the unique regulatory environment of individual country further we must ensure the timely production distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidate to the numerous and varied clinical trial site if we fail to adequately manage the design execution and diverse regulatory aspect of our large and complex clinical trial or manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply corresponding regulatory approval may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidate or could lose our ability to market existing product in certain therapeutic area or altogether if we are unable to market and sell our product candidate or to obtain approval in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategy our business and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected we rely on independent third party clinical investigator to recruit subject and conduct clinical trial on our behalf in accordance with the applicable study protocol and law and regulation further we rely on unaffiliated third party vendor to perform certain aspect of our clinical trial operation we also may acquire company that have ongoing clinical trial these trial may not be conducted to the same standard ours however once an acquisition ha been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of the trial including any potential risk and liability associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trial if regulatory authority determine that we or others including our licensee or the independent investigator selected by or by company we have acquired have not complied with regulation applicable to the clinical trial those authority may refuse or reject some or all of the clinical trial data or take other action which could impair our ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval of the product or indication if we were unable to market and sell our product or product candidate our business and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected in addition some of our clinical trial involve drug manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical company these drug may be administered in clinical trial in combination with one of our product or product candidate or in head to head study comparing the product or product candidate relative efficacy and safety in the event that any of these vendor or pharmaceutical company have unforeseen issue that negatively impact the quality of their work or creates shortage of supply our ability to complete our applicable clinical trial and or evaluate clinical result may also be negatively impacted result this could adversely affect our ability to timely file for gain or maintain regulatory approval worldwide participant in clinical trial of our product and product candidate may also suffer adverse medical event or side effect that could delay the clinical trial program require additional or longer trial to gain approval prohibit regulatory approval of our product candidate or new indication for existing product and render the product candidate commercially unfeasible or limit our ability to market existing product completely or in certain therapeutic area clinical trial must be designed based on the current standard of medical care however in certain disease such cancer the standard of care is evolving rapidly in these disease the duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trial may result in the design of such clinical trial being based on standard of medical care that are no longer the current standard when such trial are completed limiting the utility and application of such trial we may not obtain favorable clinical trial result and therefore may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidate new indication for existing product or maintenance of our current product label after product is on the market safety concern may require additional or more extensive clinical trial part of risk management plan for our product or for approval of new indication for example in connection with the june esa label change we also agreed to conduct additional clinical trial examining the use of esas in ckd additional clinical trial we initiate including those required by the fda could result in substantial additional expense and the outcome could result in additional label restriction or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication each of which could have material adverse effect on the sale of our product our business and result of operation additionally any negative result from such trial could materially affect the extent of approval the use reimbursement and sale of our product we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars we currently face competition in europe from biosimilars and we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars in the future to the extent that government adopt more permissive approval framework and competitor are able to obtain broader marketing approval for biosimilars our product will become subject to increased competition expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent right could trigger such competition and we could face more litigation regarding the validity and or scope of our patent our product may also experience greater competition from lower cost biosimilars that come to market branded product that compete with our product lose patent protection in the eu the ec ha granted marketing authorization for several biosimilars pursuant to set of general and product class specific guideline for biosimilar approval issued since in addition in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization and or increase potential healthcare saving some european country such france have considered and may adopt biosimilar uptake measure such requiring physician prescribing quota or automatic substitution by pharmacist of biosimilars for the corresponding reference product some eu country may impose automatic price reduction upon market entry of the second or third biosimilar competitor we can not predict to what extent the entry of biosimilars or other competing product will impact future sale of our product in the eu our inability to compete effectively could reduce sale which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation in the united state the aca authorized the fda to approve biosimilars via separate abbreviated pathway see item business government regulation regulation in the united state approval of biosimilars growing number of company have announced their intention to develop biosimilar version of existing biotechnology product including number of our product well the biosimilars we are working to develop four manufacturer have announced the filing of five separate marketing application to the fda under the biosimilar pathway these marketing application include two for filgrastim one for pegfilgrastim and one for epoetin alfa which if approved would compete with our neupogen neulasta and epogen product respectively initial fda approval for the first biosimilars may occur early further other biosimilar manufacturer with approved product in europe may seek to obtain approval now that the regulatory pathway for biosimilars ha been enacted the pathway includes the option for biosimilar product meeting certain criterion to be approved interchangeable with their reference product some company currently developing biosimilars may seek to register their product interchangeable biologics which could make it easier for prescribers or pharmacist to substitute those biosimilars for our product in addition critic of the year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely seek to shorten the data exclusivity period and or to encourage the fda to interpret narrowly the law provision regarding which new product receive data exclusivity while we are unable to predict the precise impact of the pending introduction of biosimilars on our product we expect in the future to face greater competition in the united state result of biosimilars and downward pressure on our product price and sale subject to our ability to enforce our patent this additional competition could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation our product face substantial competition we operate in highly competitive environment see item business competition in the future we expect that our product will compete with new drug currently in development drug currently approved for other indication that may later be approved for the same indication those of our product and drug approved for other indication that are used label large pharmaceutical company and generic manufacturer of pharmaceutical product are expanding into the biotechnology field and some pharmaceutical company and generic manufacturer have formed partnership to pursue biosimilars in addition some of our competitor may have technical competitive or other advantage over for the development of technology and process or greater experience in particular therapeutic area these advantage may make it difficult for to compete with them to successfully discover develop and market new product and for our current product to compete with new product or new product indication that these competitor may bring to market result our product may compete against product that have lower price equivalent or superior performance better safety profile are easier to administer or that are otherwise competitive with our product our product may also experience greater competition from lower cost biosimilars or generic that come to market branded product that compete with our product lose their own patent protection in november teva launched short acting granix in the to compete with neupogen and long acting lipegfilgrastim in europe to compete with neulasta in addition epogen and aranesp face competition from the launch of mircera in the united state in october pursuant to december settlement agreement between amgen and roche roche began selling mircera in the state under the term of limited license agreement in addition our product candidate may face competition from competing product that achieve earlier entry into the market for example several of our competitor are working to develop inhibitor at the same time we are developing repatha our own inhibitor if competitor gain marketing approval for it inhibitor and launch it product prior to repatha receiving marketing approval the competing product may have an advantage due to it earlier entry into the market our sale depend on coverage and reimbursement from third party payer sale of our principal product are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third party payer including government healthcare program and private insurance plan government and private insurer have pursued and continue to pursue aggressive cost containment and utilization management initiative including increased focus on comparing the effectiveness benefit and cost of similar treatment which could result in lower reimbursement rate for our product or narrower population for our product will be reimbursed by payer substantial portion of our business relies on reimbursement from federal government healthcare program further the federal agency responsible for administering medicare medicaid and the new health insurance marketplace or exchange cm ha substantial power to quickly implement policy change that can significantly affect how our product are covered and reimbursed additionally there is an increased focus in the united state on analyzing the impact of various government program on the federal deficit which ha resulted in increased pressure on federal program to reduce cost and could lead to lower payment rate for our product additionally the implementation of aca exchange could drive consolidation in the insurance industry the resulting consolidated entity could have greater leverage in making coverage and reimbursement decision and exert additional pressure on our ability to price and secure patient access for our product further the current exchange offering tend to have very high deductible and cost sharing requirement for drug access to our product may be affected by the structure and amount of patient out of pocket payment in both plan that operate in exchange and also commercial plan change to those out of pocket payment or limitation to payment assistance option could have material adverse effect on the sale of our product our business and result of operation private payer including healthcare insurer and pharmacy benefit manager also continue to seek to reduce their cost healthcare insurer pharmacy benefit manager and other payer may seek price discount or rebate in connection with the placement of our product on their formulary or those they manage they could also impose restriction on access to our product or future product and could even choose to exclude coverage entirely such discount rebate restriction or exclusion could materially and adversely affect sale of our affected product outside the united state we expect that country will continue to take aggressive action to reduce their healthcare expenditure see item business reimbursement any deterioration in the coverage and reimbursement available for our product or in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payer to physician and other provider could negatively impact the ability or willingness of healthcare provider to prescribe our product for their patient or otherwise negatively affect the use of our product or the price we receive for them such change could have material adverse effect on the sale of our product our business and result of operation we also face risk relating to the reporting of pricing data that affect the reimbursement of and discount for our product pricing data that we submit impact the payment rate for provider rebate we pay and discount we are required to provide under medicare medicaid and other government drug program and the calculation are complex price reporting regulation require manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data our price reporting data calculation are reviewed on quarterly basis and based on such review we have on occasion restated previously reported pricing data to reflect change in calculation methodology reasonable assumption and or underlying data if our submitted pricing data are incorrect we may become subject to substantial fine and penalty or other government enforcement action which could have material adverse impact on our business and result of operation in addition if our pricing calculation are incorrect we also may be required to pay additional rebate and provide additional discount we rely on third party supplier for certain of our raw material medical device and component we rely on unaffiliated third party supplier for certain raw material medical device and component necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical product certain of those raw material medical device and component are the proprietary product of those unaffiliated third party supplier and are specifically cited in our drug application with regulatory agency so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or source and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier also certain of the raw material required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our product are sourced from other country and or derived from biological source including mammalian tissue bovine serum and human serum albumin the reason we may be unable to obtain these raw material medical device and component include regulatory requirement or action by regulatory agency or others adverse financial or other strategic development at or affecting the supplier unexpected demand for or shortage of raw material medical device or component failure to comply with our quality standard which result in quality and product failure product contamination and or recall material shortage contamination recall and or restriction on the use of certain biologically derived substance or other raw material discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfection in raw material medical device or component and labor dispute or shortage including the effect of pandemic flu outbreak natural disaster or otherwise these event could negatively impact our ability to satisfy demand for our product which could materially and adversely affect our product use and sale and our business and operating result for example in prior year we have experienced shortage in certain component necessary for the formulation fill and finish of certain of our product in our puerto rico facility further quality issue which result in unexpected additional demand for certain component may lead to shortage of required raw material or component such we have experienced with epogen glass vial we may experience or continue to experience these or other shortage in the future resulting in delayed shipment supply constraint contract dispute and or stock out of our product we continue to investigate alternative to certain biological source and alternative manufacturing process that do not require the use of certain biologically derived substance such raw material may be subject to contamination and or recall however any disruption or delay by or by third party supplier or partner in converting to alternative to certain biologically derived substance and alternative manufacturing process or our ability to gain regulatory approval for the alternative material and manufacturing process could increase our associated cost or result in the recognition of an impairment in the carrying value of certain related asset which could have material and adverse effect on our business and result of operation manufacturing difficulty disruption or delay could limit supply of our product and limit our product sale manufacturing biologic human therapeutic product is difficult complex and highly regulated we currently are involved in the manufacture of all of our principal product and plan to manufacture many of our product candidate in addition we currently use third party contract manufacturer to produce or assist in the production of enbrel prolia sensipar mimpara nplate xgeva vectibix and kyprolis and plan to use contract manufacturer to produce or assist in the production of number of our late stage product candidate our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our product and product candidate is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facility and those of our third party contract manufacturer which may be impacted by capacity of our facility and those of our contract manufacturer contamination by microorganism or virus or foreign particle from the manufacturing process natural or other disaster including hurricane earthquake volcano or fire labor dispute or shortage including the effect of pandemic flu outbreak natural disaster or otherwise degree of compliance with regulatory requirement change in forecast of future demand timing and actual number of production run updating of manufacturing specification production success rate and yield contractual dispute with our supplier and contract manufacturer and timing and outcome of product quality testing if the efficient manufacture and supply of our product or product candidate is interrupted we may experience delayed shipment delay in our clinical trial supply constraint stock out and or recall of our product over the past several year we have initiated number of voluntary recall of certain lot of our product for example beginning in september we voluntary recall of certain lot of epogen and voluntarily recalled certain lot of procrit manufactured by because small number of vial in each lot were found to contain glass lamella extremely thin barely visible glass flake which we believed wa result of the interaction of the product formulation with glass vial during the shelf life of the product the recall were executed in close cooperation with the fda an additional example in july we initiated voluntary recall of an aranesp lot distributed in the eu after particle were detected in quality control sample following distribution of that lot we may experience the same or other problem in the future resulting in broader product recall adverse event trend delayed shipment supply constraint contract dispute and or stock out of our product if we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our product to patient we may lose patient and physician may elect to prescribe competing therapeutic instead of our product which could materially and adversely affect our product sale business and result of operation our manufacturing process and those of our third party contract manufacturer must undergo regulatory approval process and are subject to continued review by the fda and other regulatory authority it can take longer than five year to build validate and license new manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three year to qualify and license new contract manufacturer currently we are completing the construction and qualification of new formulation and filling facility at our puerto rico site and we are modifying and expanding our recently acquired formulation fill and finish manufacturing site in ireland both of which will require appropriate licensure by regulatory authority additionally in we completed construction of the planned monoclonal antibody manufacturing facility in singapore this singapore facility will utilize novel manufacturing technology that ha not been previously approved by the fda or other regulatory authority in we also announced plan to build an additional facility at the site in singapore to enable the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for kyprolis these facility in singapore will also require licensure by various regulatory authority if we are unable to obtain needed license for any of these facility on timely basis it could adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned risk mitigation and cost reduction which result could materially and adversely affect our product sale business and result of operation if regulatory authority determine that we or our third party contract manufacturer or certain of our third party service provider have violated regulation or if they restrict suspend or revoke our prior approval they could prohibit from manufacturing our product or conducting clinical trial or selling our marketed product until we or the affected third party contract manufacturer or third party service provider comply or indefinitely because our third party contract manufacturer and certain of our third party service provider are subject to the fda and foreign regulatory authority alternative qualified third party contract manufacturer and third party service provider may not be available on timely basis or at all if we or our third party contract manufacturer or third party service provider cease or interrupt production or if our third party contract manufacturer and third party service provider fail to supply material product or service to we may experience delayed shipment supply constraint stock out and or recall of our product additionally we distribute substantial volume of our commercial product through our primary distribution center in louisville kentucky for the united state and in breda the netherlands for europe and much of the rest of the world we also conduct all the labeling and packaging of our product distributed in europe and much of the rest of the world in breda the netherlands our ability to timely supply product is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our distribution and logistics center our third party logistics provider and our labeling and packaging facility in breda further we rely on commercial transportation for the distribution of our product to our customer which may be negatively impacted by natural disaster or security threat we perform substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activity at our puerto rico manufacturing facility and substantial amount of our clinical manufacturing activity at our thousand oak california manufacturing facility if significant natural disaster or production failure occur at the puerto rico facility we may not be able to supply these product or at the thousand oak facility we may not be able to continue our clinical trial we currently perform all of the formulation fill and finish for neulasta neupogen aranesp epogen prolia and xgeva and substantially all of the formulation fill and finish operation for enbrel at our manufacturing facility in junco puerto rico we also currently perform all of the bulk manufacturing for neulasta neupogen and aranesp all of the purification of bulk epogen material and substantially all of the bulk manufacturing for prolia and xgeva at this facility we perform substantially all of the bulk manufacturing and formulation fill and finish and packaging for product candidate to be used in clinical trial at our manufacturing facility in thousand oak california the global supply of our product and product candidate is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facility number of factor could materially and adversely affect our operation including power failure and or other utility failure breakdown failure or substandard performance of equipment improper installation or operation of equipment labor dispute or shortage including the effect of pandemic flu outbreak inability or unwillingness of third party supplier to provide raw material and component and natural or other disaster including hurricane earthquake or fire these or other problem may result in our being unable to supply our product which could materially and adversely affect our product sale business and operating result our puerto rico facility is also subject to the same difficulty disruption or delay in manufacturing experienced in our other manufacturing facility for example the limited number of lot of epogen voluntarily recalled in were manufactured at our puerto rico facility in future inspection our failure to adequately address the fda expectation could lead to further inspection of the facility or regulatory action see manufacturing difficulty disruption or delay could limit supply of our product and limit our product sale our effort to acquire other company or product and to integrate their operation may not be successful and may result in cost delay or failure to realize the benefit of the transaction we have an ongoing process of evaluating potential merger acquisition partnering and in license opportunity that we expect will contribute to our future growth and expand our geographic footprint product offering and or our pipeline acquisition may result in unanticipated cost delay or other operational or financial problem related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company which may result in the diversion of our management attention from other business issue and opportunity failure or difficulty in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operation of the business that we acquire including their technology compliance program financial system distribution and general business operation and procedure while preserving important distribution marketing promotion and other relationship may affect our ability to grow and may result in incurring asset impairment or restructuring charge for example on october we acquired onyx biopharmaceutical company with several currently marketed product well pipeline candidate progressing through the development process and failure or difficulty in the integration of onyx could result in material adverse impact on our business and result of operation our intellectual property position may be challenged invalidated circumvented or expire or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent right and other intellectual property right that are important to the commercialization of our product and product candidate the patent position of pharmaceutical and biotechnology company can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal scientific and factual question third party may challenge invalidate or circumvent our patent and patent application relating to our product product candidate and technology in addition our patent position might not protect against competitor with similar product or technology because competing product or technology may not infringe our patent for certain of our product candidate there are third party who have patent or pending patent application that they may claim necessitate payment of royalty or prevent from commercializing these product candidate in certain territory patent dispute are frequent costly and can preclude delay or increase the cost of commercialization of product we have been in the past and may be in the future involved in patent litigation determination made by court agency or tribunal concerning infringement validity enforceability injunctive or economic remedy or the right to patent protection for example are typically subject to appellate or administrative review upon review such initial determination may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed reversed or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceeding patent dispute or litigation may not discourage potential violator from bringing the product that is alleged to infringe to market prior to final resolution of the dispute or litigation the period of time from inception until resolution of patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending we may be subject to competition during this period and may not be able to fully recover for the loss damage and harm we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail moreover if we lose or settle current or future litigation at certain stage or entirely we could be subject to competition and or significant liability be required to enter into third party license for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute in addition we can not guarantee that such license will be available on term acceptable to or at all further under the hatch waxman act our product approved by the fda under the fdca may be the subject of patent litigation with generic competitor before expiry of the five year period of data exclusivity provided for under the hatch waxman act and prior to the expiration of the patent listed for the product likewise our innovative biologic product may be the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patent and with respect to competitor seeking approval biosimilar or interchangeable version of our product prior to the twelve year exclusivity period provided under the aca in addition we may face additional patent litigation involving claim that the biosimilar product candidate we are working to develop infringe the patent of other company that manufacture market or sell the applicable reference product certain of the existing patent on our principal product have recently expired or will expire this year or over the next few year see item business marketing distribution and selected marketed product patent our patent expire may be able to legally produce and market similar product or technology including biosimilars which may have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation we have received and we continue to seek additional patent protection relating to our product including patent on our product specific process for making our product formulation and particular us of our product however competitor may be able to invalidate design around or otherwise circumvent our patent and sell competing product our sale and operation are subject to the risk of business in emerging market we expect significant portion of growth in our future business to come from expanding in emerging market we continue our expansion effort in emerging market around the world through acquisition and licensing transaction well through the development and introduction of our current product into new market we face numerous risk to our business there is no guarantee that the company effort and strategy to expand sale in emerging market will succeed emerging market country may be especially vulnerable to period of global political legal regulatory and financial instability including sovereign debt issue fluctuation in currency exchange rate and or the imposition of international sanction in response to certain state action the company may also be required to increase it reliance on third party agent and unfamiliar operation and arrangement previously utilized by company that we partner with or acquire in emerging market see we must conduct clinical trial in human before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidate or existing product for new indication our international operation and business may also be subject to le protective intellectual property or other applicable law diverse data privacy and protection requirement changing tax law and tariff far reaching anti bribery and anti corruption law and regulation and an evolving legal and regulatory environment these legal and operational challenge along with governmental control the challenge of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining and or maintain necessary regulatory or pricing approval of our product may result in material adverse impact on the international sale of our product our business and result of operation concentration of sale at certain of our wholesaler distributor and consolidation of free standing dialysis clinic business may negatively impact our business the substantial majority of our product sale is made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributor amerisourcebergen corporation cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation these distributor in turn sell our product to their customer which include physician or their clinic dialysis center hospital and pharmacy one of our product epogen is sold primarily to free standing dialysis clinic which have experienced significant consolidation two organization davita and fresenius medical care north america own or manage large number of the outpatient dialysis facility located in the united state and account for substantial majority of all epogen sale in the free standing dialysis clinic setting due to this concentration these entity have substantial purchasing leverage which may put pressure on our pricing by their potential ability to extract price discount on our product or fee for other service correspondingly negatively impacting our bargaining position and profit margin our business may be affected by litigation and government investigation we and certain of our subsidiary are involved in legal proceeding see part iv note contingency and commitment to the consolidated financial statement civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome can result in costly verdict fine and penalty exclusion from the federal healthcare program and or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business defense of litigation claim can be expensive time consuming and distracting and it is possible that we could incur judgment or enter into settlement of claim for monetary damage or change the way we operate our business which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation in addition product liability is major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical product we may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trial and for product that we sell after regulatory approval product liability claim regardless of their merit could be costly and divert management attention and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our product amgen and immunex have previously been named defendant in product liability action for certain of our product we are also involved in government investigation that arise in the ordinary course of our business we announced on december we finalized settlement agreement with the government and various other party to settle certain allegation regarding our sale and marketing practice however we may also be subject to action by governmental entity including those not participating in the settlement and may in the future become subject to claim by other party in each case with respect to the alleged conduct which is the subject of the settlement we may see new governmental investigation of or action against citing novel theory of recovery any of these result could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liability could affect our profitability we are subject to income and other tax in the united state and other jurisdiction in which we do business result our provision for income tax is derived from combination of applicable tax rate in the various place we operate significant is required for determining our provision for income tax and our tax return are periodically examined by various tax authority we believe our accrual for tax liability is adequate for all open year based on past experience interpretation of tax law and judgment about potential action by tax authority however due to the complexity of the provision for income tax the ultimate resolution of any tax matter may result in payment greater or le than amount accrued our provision for income tax and result of operation in the future could be adversely affected by change to our operating structure change in the mix of income and expense in country with differing tax rate change in the valuation of deferred tax asset and liability and change in applicable tax law regulation or administrative interpretation thereof for example there are several proposal under consideration in the united state to reform tax law including proposal that may reduce or eliminate the deferral of income tax on our unrepatriated foreign earnings significant change to the tax system such change to the taxation of income earned outside the united state including credit allowed for foreign tax or significant change to the puerto rico tax system could have material and adverse effect on our business and on the result of our operation we may not be able to access the capital and credit market on term that are favorable to or at all the capital and credit market may experience extreme volatility and disruption which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issue for both borrower and investor we may access the capital market to supplement our existing fund and cash generated from operation in satisfying our need for working capital capital expenditure and debt service requirement our plan to pay dividend and other business initiative we plan to strategically pursue including acquisition and licensing activity in the event of adverse capital and credit market condition we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable term or at all which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation change in credit rating issued by nationally recognized credit rating agency could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market

of our product together with our general operation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation in the united state and to extensive regulation in foreign country see our current product and product in development can not be sold without regulatory approval and manufacturing difficulty disruption or delay could limit supply of our product and limit our product sale in addition our business is complex involves significant operational risk and includes the use of third party to conduct business while we have implemented numerous risk mitigation measure to comply with such regulation in this complex operating environment we can not guarantee that we will be able to effectively mitigate all operational risk further we are operating under corporate integrity agreement with the department of health and human service oig which requires to maintain our corporate compliance program and to undertake set of defined obligation the corporate integrity agreement requires to

range of action could result including but not limited to the termination of clinical trial the failure to approve product candidate restriction on our product or manufacturing process withdrawal of our product from the market significant fine exclusion from government healthcare program or other sanction or litigation such occurrence could have material and adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation we are increasingly dependent on information technology system infrastructure and data we are increasingly dependent upon information technology system infrastructure and data the multitude and complexity of our computer system make them inherently vulnerable to service interruption or destruction malicious intrusion and random attack likewise data privacy or security breach by employee or others may pose risk that sensitive data including intellectual property trade secret or personal information belonging to the company it patient customer or other business partner may be exposed to unauthorized person or to the public cyber attack are increasing in their frequency sophistication and intensity and have become increasingly difficult to detect cyber attack could include the deployment of harmful malware denial of service social engineering and other mean to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality integrity and availability our key business partner face similar risk and any security breach of their system could adversely affect our security posture while in the past we have experienced cyber attack and intrusion into our computer system we do not believe that such attack have had material adverse effect on our operation while we continue to invest heavily in the protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our effort will prevent service interruption or identify breach in our system that adversely affect our business and operation and or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information which could result in financial legal business or reputational harm to global economic condition may negatively affect and may magnify certain risk that affect our business our operation and performance have been and may continue to be affected by economic condition in the united state and throughout the world more fully explained below financial pressure may cause government or other third party payer to more aggressively seek cost containment through mandatory discount on our product policy requiring the automatic substitution of generic or biosimilars higher hurdle for initial reimbursement approval for new product or other similar measure see we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars for example in recent year amgen ha had to pay increased discount under the drug pricing program in the united state through expansion to more setting of care and making more entity eligible to the mandatory discount additionally result of global economic condition third party payer may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligation in addition result of the economic condition and or employer decision regarding the insurance coverage mandate that go into effect in the united state in and some employer may seek to reduce cost by reducing or eliminating employer group healthcare plan or transferring greater portion of healthcare cost to their employee job loss or other economic hardship may also result in reduced level of coverage for some individual potentially resulting in lower level of healthcare coverage for or their family these economic condition may affect patient ability to afford health care result of increased co pay or deductible obligation greater cost sensitivity to existing co pay or deductible obligation lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reason we believe such condition have led and could continue to lead to change in patient behavior and spending pattern that negatively affect usage of certain of our product including some patient delaying treatment rationing prescription medication leaving prescription unfilled reducing the frequency of visit to healthcare facility utilizing alternative therapy and or foregoing healthcare insurance coverage in addition to it effect on consumer any economic downturn may have also increased cost sensitivity among medical provider in the united state such oncology clinic particularly in circumstance where provider may experience challenge in the collection of patient co pay or be forced to absorb treatment cost result of coverage decision or reimbursement term collectively we believe these change have resulted and may continue to result in reduced demand for our product which could materially and adversely affect the sale of our product our business and result of operation any resulting decrease in demand for our product could also cause to experience excess inventory write offs and or excess capacity or impairment charge at certain of our manufacturing facility economic condition continue to affect our operation and performance outside the united state well particularly in country where government sponsored healthcare system are the primary payer for healthcare expenditure credit and economic condition have adversely impacted the timing of collection of our trade receivables see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation financial condition liquidity and capital resource further economic challenge may impact our ability to collect some or all of our receivables which could have material adverse impact on our operating cash flow and material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or result of operation see our sale depend on coverage and reimbursement from third party payer we also rely upon third party for certain part of our business including licensee and partner wholesale distributor of our product contract clinical trial provider contract manufacturer and single third party supplier there may be disruption or delay in the performance or satisfaction of commitment to by these third party which could have material adverse effect on the sale of our product our business and result of operation current economic condition may adversely affect the ability of our distributor customer and supplier to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw material and to perform their obligation under agreement with which could disrupt our operation further economic condition appear to have affected and may continue to affect the business practice of our wholesale distributor in manner that contributes to lower sale of our product although we monitor our distributor customer and supplier financial condition and their liquidity in order to mitigate our business risk some of our distributor customer and supplier may become insolvent which could have material adverse effect on the sale of our product our business and result of operation these risk may be elevated with respect to our interaction with third party with substantial operation in country where current economic condition are the most severe particularly where such third party are themselves exposed to sovereign risk from business interaction directly with fiscally challenged government payer we maintain significant portfolio of investment disclosed cash equivalent and marketable security on our consolidated balance sheet the value of our investment may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuation downgrade in credit rating illiquidity in the capital market and other factor that may result in other than temporary decline in the value of our investment any of those event could cause to record impairment charge with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize loss on the sale of investment stock price is volatile our stock price like that of our peer in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry is

utbs net of foreign tax credit and federal tax benefit of state tax and related accrued interest and penalty totaling approximately billion at december are not included in the table above because due to their nature there is high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflow and other event that extinguish these liability in addition to amount in the table above we are contractually obligated to pay additional amount which in the aggregate are significant upon the achievement of various development regulatory and commercial milestone for agreement we have entered into with third party including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisition of biovex these payment are contingent upon the occurrence of various future event substantially all of which have high degree of uncertainty of occurring these contingent payment have not been included in the table above and except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet of december the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreement we have entered into with third party is approximately billion including million of contingent consideration payment in connection with the acquisition of biovex see part iv note fair value measurement to the consolidated financial statement of critical accounting policiesthe preparation of our consolidated financial statement in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the amount reported in the financial statement and the note to the financial statement some of those judgment can be subjective and complex and therefore actual result could differ materially from those estimate under different assumption or condition product sale and sale deductionsrevenues from sale of our product are recognized when the product are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed product sale are recorded net of accrual for estimated rebate wholesaler chargebacks cash discount and other deduction collectively sale deduction and return which are established at the time of sale we analyze the adequacy of our accrual for sale deduction quarterly amount accrued for sale deduction are adjusted when trend or significant event indicate that adjustment is appropriate accrual are also adjusted to reflect actual result amount recorded in accrued liability in the consolidated balance sheet for sale deduction were follows in million rebate chargebacks other deduction totalbalance of january charged against product balance of december charged against product balance of december charged against product balance of december the year ended december and total sale deduction were and of gross product sale respectively included in these amount are immaterial adjustment related to prior year sale due to change in estimate such amount represent or le of the aggregate sale deduction charged against product sale in each of the three year ended december in the united state we utilize wholesaler the principal mean of distributing our product to healthcare provider such physician or their clinic dialysis center hospital and pharmacy product we sell in europe are distributed principally to hospital and or wholesaler depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold we monitor the inventory level of our product at our wholesaler by using data from our wholesaler and other third party and we believe wholesaler inventory have been maintained at appropriate level generally two to three week given end user demand accordingly historical fluctuation in wholesaler inventory level have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sale deduction and return accrual for sale deduction are based primarily on estimate of the amount earned or to be claimed on the related sale these estimate take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirement specific known market event and trend internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying pattern sale deduction are substantially product specific and therefore for any given year can be impacted by the mix of product sold rebate include primarily amount paid to payer and provider in the united state including those paid to state medicaid program and are based on contractual arrangement or statutory requirement which vary by product by payer and individual payer plan we sell product we estimate the amount of rebate that will be paid by based on the product sold contractual term estimated patient population historical experience and wholesaler inventory level and accrue these rebate in the period the related sale is recorded we then adjust the rebate accrual more information becomes available and to reflect actual claim experience estimating such rebate is complicated in part due to the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability which can take more than one year we believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebate is reasonable and appropriate given current fact and circumstance however actual result may differ for example we had managed medicaid rebate adjustment of million in change in annual estimate related to prior annual period were le than of the estimated rebate amount charged against product sale for the year ended december and le than for the year ended december and including the aforementioned adjustment change in our rebate estimate attributable rebate recognized in would have had an impact of approximately million or approximately of our product sale and corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreement to sell product to healthcare provider in the united state at fixed price that are lower than the price we charge wholesaler when healthcare provider purchase our product through wholesaler at these reduced price wholesaler charge for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price between amgen and the healthcare provider the provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sale by our wholesaler customer to healthcare provider accrual for wholesaler chargebacks are le difficult to estimate than rebate and closely approximate actual result since chargeback amount are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider and we generally settle the liability for these deduction within few week product returnsreturns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sale on production lot basis historical rate of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected change in the marketplace specific to each product when appropriate in each of the last three year sale return provision have amounted to le than of gross product sale change in estimate for prior year sale return provision have historically been insignificant income taxesthe company provides for income tax based on pretax income and applicable tax rate available in the various jurisdiction in which it operates we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement on particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized the amount of utbs is adjusted appropriate for change in fact and circumstance such significant amendment to existing tax law new regulation or interpretation by the taxing authority new information obtained during tax examination or resolution of an examination we believe our estimate for uncertain tax position are appropriate and sufficient for any assessment that may result from examination of our tax return we recognize both accrued interest and penalty where appropriate related to utbs in income tax expense certain item are included in the company tax return at different time than they are reflected in the financial statement and cause temporary difference between the tax base of asset and liability and their reported amount such temporary difference create deferred tax asset and liability deferred tax asset are generally item that can be used tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future year but for which the company ha already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statement the company establishes valuation allowance against it deferred tax asset when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit deferred tax liability are either tax expense recognized in the financial statement for which payment ha been deferred ii expense for which the company ha already taken deduction on the tax return but ha not yet recognized the expense in the financial statement or iii liability for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible asset acquired in many business combination future expense associated with these asset most often will not be tax deductible the company is vertically integrated enterprise with operation in the united state and various foreign jurisdiction the company is subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdiction where it conduct activity based on the tax law and principle of such jurisdiction and the function risk and activity performed therein the company pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign source based on the operation performed in each location and the tax law and principle of the respective taxing jurisdiction for example the company conduct significant operation outside the united state in puerto rico pertaining to manufacturing distribution and other related function to meet it worldwide product demand income from the company operation in puerto rico is subject to tax incentive grant that expires in our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no income tax or foreign withholding tax have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the united state substantially all of this benefit is attributable to the company foreign income associated with the company operation conducted in puerto rico if future event including material change in cash working capital and long term investment requirement necessitate that certain asset associated with these earnings be repatriated to the united state under current tax law an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable income tax rate which could have material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial result operation are subject to the tax law regulation and administrative practice of the united state state jurisdiction and other country in which we do business significant change in these rule could have material adverse effect on the company result of operation see part item risk factor the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liability could affect our profitability contingenciesin the ordinary course of business we are involved in various legal proceeding and other matter such intellectual property dispute contractual dispute governmental investigation and class action suit which are complex in nature and have outcome that are difficult to predict certain of these proceeding are discussed in part iv note contingency and commitment to the consolidated financial statement we record accrual for loss contingency to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated we consider all relevant factor when making assessment regarding these contingency while it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcome of these item an adverse determination in one or more of these item currently pending could have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation financial position or cash flow valuation of asset and liability in connection with business combinationswe have acquired and continue to acquire intangible asset in connection with business combination these intangible asset consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic product and ipr product candidate discounted cash flow model are typically used to determine the fair value of these intangible asset for purpose of allocating consideration paid to the net asset acquired in business combination these model require the use of significant estimate and assumption including but not limited to determining the timing and expected cost to complete in process project taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the fda and other regulatory agency for product candidate estimating the timing of and future net cash flow from product sale resulting from completed product and in process project and developing appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of the cash flow significant estimate and assumption are also required to determine the acquisition date fair value of any contingent consideration obligation incurred in connection with business combination in addition we must revalue these obligation each subsequent reporting period until the related contingency are resolved and record change in their fair value in earnings the acquisition date fair value of various contingent consideration obligation incurred or assumed in the acquisition of business see part iv note business combination and note fair value measurement to the consolidated financial statement were determined using combination of valuation technique significant estimate and assumption required for these valuation included but were not limited to the probability of achieving regulatory milestone product sale projection under various scenario and discount rate used to calculate the present value of the required payment these estimate and assumption are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligation each reporting period accordingly subsequent change in underlying fact and circumstance could result in change in these estimate and assumption which could have material impact on the estimated future fair value of these obligation we believe the fair value used to record intangible asset acquired and contingent consideration obligation incurred in connection with business combination are based upon reasonable estimate and assumption given the fact and circumstance of the related valuation date impairment of long lived assetswe review the carrying value of our property plant and equipment and our finite lived intangible asset for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if such circumstance exist an estimate of undiscounted future cash flow to be generated by the long lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists if an asset is determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset fair value and it carrying value lived intangible asset composed of ipr project acquired in business combination which have not reached technological feasibility are reviewed annually for impairment and whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable we determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to it carrying value if the asset carrying value exceeds it fair value an impairment charge is recorded for the difference and it carrying value is reduced accordingly estimating future cash flow of an ipr product candidate for purpose of an impairment analysis requires to make significant estimate and assumption regarding the amount and timing of cost to complete the project and the amount timing and probability of achieving revenue from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project wa determined described above there are often major risk and uncertainty associated with ipr project we are required to obtain regulatory approval in order to be able to market these product such approval require completing clinical trial that demonstrate product candidate is safe and effective consequently the eventual realized value of the acquired ipr project may vary from it estimated fair value at the date of acquisition and ipr impairment charge may occur in future period which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation we believe our estimation of future cash flow used for assessing impairment of long lived asset are based on reasonable assumption given the fact and circumstance of the related date of the assessment item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskwe are exposed to market risk that may result from change in interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and price of equity instrument well change in general economic condition in the country where we conduct business to reduce certain of these risk we enter into various type of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transaction part of our risk management program we do not use derivative for speculative trading purpose in the discussion that follows we have assumed hypothetical change in interest rate of basis point from those at december and we have also assumed hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rate against the dollar based on it position relative to other currency of december and interest rate sensitive financial instrumentsour portfolio of available for sale interest bearing security at december and wa comprised of treasury security and other government related debt security corporate debt security residential mortgage backed and other mortgage and asset backed security money market mutual fund and other short term interest bearing security composed principally of commercial paper the fair value of our investment portfolio of interest bearing security were billion and billion at december and respectively duration is sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of security that will result from basis point change in interest rate applying duration model hypothetical basis point increase in interest rate at december and would have resulted in reduction in the fair value of these security of approximately million and million respectively on these date in addition hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rate at december and would not result in material effect on income or cash flow in the respective ensuing year of december we had outstanding debt with carrying value of billion and fair value of billion of december we had outstanding debt with carrying value of billion and fair value of billion our outstanding debt wa comprised primarily of debt with fixed interest rate the carrying value of variable rate debt wa billion and billion at december and respectively change in interest rate do not affect interest expense or cash flow on fixed rate debt change in interest rate would however affect the fair value of fixed rate debt hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rate relative to interest rate at december would have resulted in an increase of approximately billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rate relative to the interest rate at december would have resulted in an increase of approximately billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date the analysis for the debt doe not consider the impact that hypothetical change in interest rate would have on the related interest rate swap contract and cross currency swap contract to achieve desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt we entered into interest rate swap contract during and which qualified and were designated for accounting purpose fair value hedge for certain of our fixed rate debt these derivative contract effectively converted fixed rate interest coupon to floating rate libor based coupon over the life of the respective note interest rate swap contract with notional amount totaling billion and billion were outstanding at december and respectively hypothetical basis point increase in interest rate relative to interest rate at december and would have resulted in reduction in fair value of approximately million and million respectively on our interest rate swap contract on these date and would not result in material effect on the related income or cash flow in the respective ensuing year the analysis for the interest rate swap contract doe not consider the impact that change in interest rate would have on the related fair value of debt that these interest rate sensitive instrument were designed to offset of december and we had outstanding cross currency swap contract with aggregate notional amount of billion that hedge certain of our foreign currency denominated debt and related interest payment these contract effectively convert interest payment and principal repayment of this debt to dollar from euro pound sterling and are designated for accounting purpose cash flow hedge hypothetical basis point adverse movement in interest rate relative to interest rate at december and would have resulted in reduction in the fair value of our cross currency swap contract of approximately million and million respectively but would have no material effect on cash flow or income in the respective ensuing year foreign currency sensitive financial instrumentsour international operation are affected by fluctuation in the value of the dollar compared to foreign currency predominantly the euro increase and decrease in our international product sale from movement in foreign currency exchange rate are offset partially by the corresponding increase or decrease in our international operating expense increase and decrease in our foreign currency denominated asset from movement in foreign currency exchange rate are offset partially by the corresponding increase or decrease in our foreign currency denominated liability to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation on our result of operation we enter into foreign currency forward option and cross currency swap contract of december we had outstanding euro and pound sterling denominated debt with carrying value and fair value of billion and billion respectively of december we had outstanding euro and pound sterling denominated debt with carrying value and fair value of billion and billion respectively hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate at december would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately million on this date and reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately million but would have no material effect on the related cash flow in the ensuing year hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate at december would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately million on this date and reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately million but would have no material effect on the related cash flow in the ensuing year the analysis for this debt doe not consider the offsetting impact that hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rate would have on the related cross currency swap contract which are in place for the majority of the foreign currency denominated debt with regard to our billion notional amount of cross currency swap contract that are designated cash flow hedge of certain of our debt denominated in euro and pound sterling of december and hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate on these date would have resulted in reduction in the fair value of these contract of approximately million and million respectively on these date but would have no material effect on the related cash flow in the respective ensuing year the impact on income in the ensuing year from these contract of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical change in the carrying amount of the related hedged debt we enter into foreign currency forward and option contract that are designated for accounting purpose cash flow
