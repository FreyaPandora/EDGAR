financing authority tax incentive we have entered into multiple agreement over the past few year with the california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority caeatfa that provide multi year sale tax exclusion on purchase of manufacturing equipment that will be used for specific purpose including the expansion and ongoing development of model model model model and future electric vehicle and the expansion of electric vehicle powertrain production in california gigafactory nevada nevada tax incentive in connection with the construction of gigafactory nevada we have entered into agreement with the state of nevada and storey county in nevada that provide abatement for sale use real property personal property and employer excise tax discount to the base tariff energy rate and transferable tax credit these incentive are available for the applicable period beginning on october and ending on either june or june depending on the incentive under these agreement we were eligible for maximum of million of transferable tax credit subject to capital investment by and our partner for gigafactory nevada of at least billion which we exceeded during and specified hiring target for gigafactory nevada which we exceeded during result of december we earned the maximum amount of credit gigafactory new york new york state investment and lease we have lease through the research foundation for the state university of new york the suny foundation for gigafactory new york which wa constructed on behalf of the suny foundation under the lease and related research and development agreement there continues to be on behalf of the suny foundation installation of certain utility and other improvement and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment designated by to be used at gigafactory new york the term of such agreement require to comply with number of covenant including required hiring and cumulative investment target which we have met to date of the applicable measurement date gigafactory shanghai lease and land use right we have lease arrangement with the local government of shanghai for land use right at gigafactory shanghai under the term of the arrangement we are required to meet cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting at the end of which we believe will be attainable even if our actual vehicle production at gigafactory shanghai were far lower than the volume we are forecasting tesla regulatory credit in connection with the production delivery placement into service and ongoing operation of our zero emission vehicle charging infrastructure and solar system in global market we have earned and will continue to earn various tradable regulatory credit we have sold these credit and will continue to sell future credit to automotive company and other regulated entity who can use the credit to comply with emission standard and other regulatory requirement for example under california zero emission vehicle regulation and those of state that have adopted california standard vehicle manufacturer are required to earn or purchase credit referred to zev credit for compliance with their annual regulatory requirement these law provide that automaker may bank or sell to other regulated party their excess credit if they earn more credit than the minimum quantity required by those law tesla also earns other type of saleable regulatory credit in the united state and abroad including greenhouse gas fuel economy renewable energy and clean fuel credit likewise several state have adopted procurement requirement for renewable energy production these requirement enable company deploying solar energy to earn tradable credit known solar renewable energy certificate srecs energy storage system incentive the regulatory regime for energy storage project is still under development nevertheless there are various policy incentive and financial mechanism at the federal state and local level that support the adoption of energy storage for example energy storage system that are charged using solar energy are eligible for the tax credit in with ramp in and beyond under section of the internal revenue code or the irc described below in addition california and number of other state have adopted procurement target for energy storage and behind the meter energy storage system qualify for funding under the california self generation incentive program the federal energy regulatory commission ferc ha also taken step to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy market for example in late ferc issued final rule order no to further break down barrier preventing energy storage from fully participating in wholesale energy market order is currently under review before the court of appeal for the circuit solar energy system government and utility program and incentive federal state and local government have established various policy incentive and financial mechanism to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy these incentive include tax credit cash grant tax abatement and rebate the federal government currently provides an uncapped investment tax credit itc under two section of the irc section and section section of the irc allows taxpayer to claim credit of of qualified expenditure for commercial solar energy system that commences construction by december the credit decline to in and permanent thereafter we claim the section commercial credit when available for both our residential and commercial project based on ownership of the solar energy system the federal government also provides accelerated depreciation for eligible commercial solar energy system section of the irc allows homeowner taxpayer to claim credit of of qualified expenditure for residential solar energy system owned by the homeowner that is placed in service by december the credit then decline to in and is scheduled to expire thereafter customer who purchase their solar energy system for cash or through our solar loan offering are eligible to claim the section investment tax credit in addition to the federal itc many state offer personal and corporate tax credit and incentive for solar energy system regulation vehicle safety and testing our vehicle are subject to and comply with or are otherwise exempt from numerous regulatory requirement established by the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa including all applicable united state federal motor vehicle safety standard fmvss our vehicle fully comply with all applicable fmvsss without the need for any exemption and we expect future tesla vehicle to either fully comply or comply with limited exemption related to new technology additionally there are regulatory change considered for several fmvss and while we anticipate compliance there is no assurance final regulation change are enacted manufacturer we must self certify that our vehicle meet all applicable fmvss well the nhtsa bumper standard or otherwise are exempt before the vehicle can be imported or sold in the numerous fmvss apply to our vehicle such crash worthiness requirement crash avoidance requirement and electric vehicle requirement we are also required to comply with other federal law administered by nhtsa including the cafe standard theft prevention act requirement consumer information labeling requirement early warning reporting requirement regarding warranty claim field report death and injury report and foreign recall and owner manual requirement the automobile information and disclosure act requires manufacturer of motor vehicle to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer suggested retail price optional equipment and pricing in addition this law allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy rating determined by epa well crash test rating determined by nhtsa if such test are conducted our vehicle sold outside of the are subject to similar foreign safety environmental and other regulation many of those regulation are different from those applicable in the and may require redesign and or retesting the european union ha established new rule regarding additional compliance oversight that are scheduled to commence in and there is also regulatory uncertainty related to the united kingdom withdrawal from the european union these change could impact the rollout of new vehicle feature in europe self driving there are no federal regulation pertaining to the safety of self driving vehicle however nhtsa ha established recommended guideline certain state have legal restriction on self driving vehicle and many other state are considering them this patchwork increase the legal complexity for our vehicle in europe certain vehicle safety regulation apply to self driving braking and steering system and certain treaty also restrict the legality of certain higher level of self driving vehicle self driving law and regulation are expected to continue to evolve in numerous jurisdiction in the and foreign country and may create restriction on self driving feature that we develop automobile manufacturer and dealer regulation state law regulate the manufacture distribution sale and service of automobile and generally require motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer to be licensed in order to sell vehicle directly to consumer in the state we open additional tesla store and service center we secure dealer license or their equivalent and engage in sale activity to sell our vehicle directly to consumer certain state do not permit automobile manufacturer to be licensed dealer or to act in the capacity of dealer or otherwise restrict manufacturer ability to deliver or service vehicle to sell vehicle to resident of state where we are not licensed dealer we generally conduct the transfer of title out of the state in such state we have opened gallery that serve an educational purpose and where the title transfer may not occur we expand our retail footprint in the some automobile dealer trade association have both challenged the legality of our operation in court and used administrative and legislative process to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing store or expand to new location we expect that the dealer association will continue to mount challenge to our business model in addition we expect the dealer association to actively lobby state licensing agency and legislator to interpret existing law or enact new law in way not favorable to tesla ownership and operation of it own retail and service location and we intend to actively fight any such effort to limit our ability to sell and service our own vehicle battery safety and testing our battery pack conforms to mandatory regulation that govern transport of dangerous good defined to include lithium ion battery which may present risk in transportation the regulation vary by mode of shipping transportation such by ocean vessel rail truck or air we have completed the applicable transportation test for our battery pack demonstrating our compliance with applicable regulation we use lithium ion cell in our high voltage battery pack in our vehicle and energy storage product the use storage and disposal of our battery pack is regulated under federal law we have agreement with third party battery recycling company to recycle our battery pack and we are also developing our own recycling technology solar energy general we are not regulated utility in the although we are subject to certain state and federal regulation applicable to solar and battery storage provider to operate our system we obtain interconnection agreement from the utility in most case interconnection agreement are standard form agreement that have been pre approved by the public utility commission or other regulatory body sale of electricity and non sale equipment lease by third party such our lease ppas and subscription agreement face regulatory challenge in some state and jurisdiction solar energy net metering most state in the have regulatory policy known net energy metering or net metering available to solar customer net metering typically allows solar customer to interconnect their on site solar energy system to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchase by receiving bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid in certain jurisdiction regulator or utility have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so solar energy mandated renewable capacity many state also have adopted procurement requirement for renewable energy production such an enforceable renewable portfolio standard or rps or other policy that require covered entity to procure specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customer in the state from eligible renewable energy source such solar energy system in srec state market the rps requires electricity supplier to secure portion of their electricity from solar generator the srec program provides mean for the generation of srecs which can then be sold separately from the energy produced to covered entity who surrender the srecs to the state to prove compliance with the state renewable energy mandate competition automotive the worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future we introduce additional vehicle in broader cross section of the passenger and commercial vehicle market and expand our vehicle capability we believe that our vehicle compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification well based on their propulsion technology for example model and model compete primarily with premium sedan and premium suv and model and model compete with small to medium sized sedan and compact suv which are extremely competitive market competing product typically include internal combustion vehicle from more established automobile manufacturer however many established and new automobile manufacturer have entered or have announced plan to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market overall we believe these announcement and vehicle introduction promote the development of the alternative fuel vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of alternative fuel vehicle particularly those fueled by electricity relative to the internal combustion vehicle many major automobile manufacturer have electric vehicle available today in major market including the china and europe and other current and prospective automobile manufacturer are also developing electric vehicle in addition several manufacturer offer hybrid vehicle including plug in version our vehicle also compete in the market based on the compelling user experience that they offer we believe that key factor in our success will be our autopilot and fsd technology that currently enable the driver assistance feature in our vehicle and in which we are making significant stride through our proprietary and powerful fsd computer and remotely updateable artificial intelligence software ultimately while we are subject to regulatory constraint over which we have no control our goal is fully autonomously driven future that improves safety and provides our customer with convenience and additional income through participation in an autonomous tesla ride hailing network this network which will also include our own fleet of vehicle will also allow to access new customer base even mode of transportation evolve finally our vehicle offer unparalleled in vehicle entertainment feature currently including internet search music service passenger karaoke and parked video streaming and gaming energy generation and storage energy storage system the market for energy storage product is also highly competitive established company such aes energy storage siemens lg chem and samsung well various emerging company have introduced product that are similar to our product portfolio there are several company providing individual component of energy storage system such cell battery module and power electronics well others providing integrated system we compete with these company based on price energy density and efficiency we believe that the specification of our product our strong brand and the modular scalable nature of our powerpack and megapack product give competitive advantage when marketing our product solar energy system the primary competitor to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility company that supply energy to our potential customer we compete with these traditional utility company primarily based on price predictability of price and the ease by which customer can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy system we also compete with solar energy company that provide product and service similar to many solar energy company only install solar energy system while others only provide financing for these installation in the residential solar energy system installation market our primary competitor include vivint solar inc sunrun inc trinity solar sunpower corporation and many smaller local solar company the electricity produced by solar installation still represents small fraction of total electricity generation with ten of million of single family home and business in our primary service territory and many more in other location we have large opportunity to expand and grow this business we make our retrofit installation more accessible and ramp our innovative solar roof we also believe that residential solar energy generation is gaining favorable regulatory momentum exemplified in part by the state of california recently requiring that new home be built with solar generation starting in intellectual property we place strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary design which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio part of our business we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property right of these innovation and design such with respect to patent trademark copyright trade secret and other measure including through employee and third party nondisclosure agreement and other contractual arrangement for example we place high priority on obtaining patent to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovation and design within our product and technology in the electric vehicle market well to protect and defend our product portfolio we have also adopted patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate lawsuit against any party for infringing our patent through activity relating to electric vehicle or related equipment for so long such party is acting in good faith we made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of common rapidly evolving platform for electric vehicle thereby benefiting ourselves other company making electric vehicle and the world employee of december tesla inc had full time employee to date we have not experienced any work stoppage and we consider our relationship with our employee to be good available information we

report on form item risk factor you should carefully consider the risk described below together with the other information set forth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future result the risk described below are not the only risk facing our company risk and uncertainty not currently known to or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result risk related to our business and industry we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future delay or other complication in the design manufacture launch and production ramp of our vehicle energy product and product feature or may not realize our manufacturing cost target which could harm our brand business prospect financial condition and operating result we have previously experienced launch and production ramp delay or other complication in connection with new vehicle model such model model and model and new vehicle feature such the all wheel drive dual motor drivetrain on model and the second version of our autopilot hardware for example we encountered unanticipated supply chain constraint that led to initial delay in producing model and an isolated supplier limitation in the manufacture of model similarly during our initial model production ramp we had challenge ramping fully automated process such portion of the battery module assembly line material flow system and the general assembly line which we addressed by reducing the level of automation and introducing semi automated or manual process in addition we have used number of new manufacturing technology technique and process for our vehicle such aluminum spot welding system and high speed blow forming of certain difficult to stamp vehicle part and we may introduce new process in the future we have also introduced unique design feature in our vehicle with different manufacturing challenge such large display screen dual motor drivetrain hardware for our autopilot and fsd feature and falcon wing door there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale any such new process or feature in particular our future business depends in large part on the high volume production of model and model which we believe are our vehicle with the largest market we have limited experience to date in manufacturing model at high volume and continuously increasing it production rate particularly across multiple vehicle manufacturing facility which we commenced in the fourth quarter of with gigafactory shanghai coming online in order to be successful we will need to implement maintain and or ramp efficient and cost effective manufacturing capability process and supply chain and achieve the design tolerance high quality and maximum output rate we have planned including at gigafactory shanghai and for model which we commenced manufacturing at the fremont factory in the first quarter of bottleneck such those we have experienced in the past with new product ramp and other unexpected challenge may also arise we ramp production and it will be important that we address them promptly while continuing to reduce our manufacturing cost if we are not successful in so or if we experience issue with our ongoing manufacturing process improvement and cost down effort we could face delay in establishing and or sustaining our model and model ramp or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability target moreover we will need to hire train and compensate skilled employee to operate high volume production facility to support our vehicle ramp at the fremont factory and gigafactory shanghai well at gigafactory nevada to support the manufacture of battery pack and drive unit for certain of our vehicle finally our vehicle model in particular model and model may share certain part supplier or production facility with each other the volume or efficiency of production with respect to one model may impact also the production of other model or lead to bottleneck that impact the production of all model we may also experience similar future delay or other complication in launching and or ramping production of new vehicle such tesla semi cybertruck and the new tesla roadster our energy storage product and the solar roof well future feature and service such new autopilot or fsd feature and the autonomous tesla ride hailing network likewise we may encounter delay with the design construction and regulatory or other approval necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing facility including our planned gigafactory berlin in germany any significant delay or other complication in the production ramp of our current product or the development manufacture launch and production ramp of our future product feature and service including complication associated with expanding our production capacity and supply chain or obtaining or maintaining related regulatory approval or inability to manage such ramp cost effectively could materially damage our brand business prospect financial condition and operating result we may be unable to meet our growing product sale delivery and installation plan and vehicle servicing and charging network need or accurately project and manage this growth internationally any of which could harm our business and prospect concurrent with developing launching and ramping our product our success will depend on our ability to continue to significantly increase their sale delivery installation and servicing worldwide while allocating our available resource among multiple product simultaneously we expand globally we will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory requirement applicable to the sale installation and service of our product the sale of electricity generated through our solar energy system and operation of supercharger in various jurisdiction which could take considerable time and expense these plan require significant cash investment and management resource and there is no guarantee that they will ultimately generate additional sale or installation of our product we continuously evaluate and appropriate evolve our retail operation and product offering in order to maximize our reach and optimize our cost vehicle line up and model differentiation and purchasing experience however there is no guarantee that each step in our evolving strategy will be perceived intended by prospective customer accustomed to more traditional sale model in particular we are targeting with model and model global mass demographic with broad range of potential customer in which we have limited experience projecting demand and pricing our product until we ramp local production at gigafactory shanghai and in the future at gigafactory berlin we will have to contend with predominantly single factory vehicle production at the fremont factory for numerous international variant if our specific demand expectation for these variant prove inaccurate we may not be able to timely generate sale matched to the specific vehicle that we produce in the timeframe or that are commensurate with our operation in given region which may negatively impact our delivery and operating result in particular period likewise we develop and grow our energy storage product and solar business worldwide our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecast demand for our product in different market moreover because we do not have independent dealer network we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicle to our customer and meeting their vehicle servicing need while we have substantially implemented and improved many aspect of our delivery and service operation we still have relatively limited experience with and may face difficulty in such delivery and servicing at high volume particularly in international market we expand for example significant transit time may be required to transport vehicle in volume into international market and we also saw challenge in initially ramping our logistical channel in china and europe we delivered model there for the first time in the first quarter of to accommodate growing volume we have deployed number of delivery model such delivery to customer home and workplace some of which have not been previously tested at scale and in different geography and may not ultimately be successful likewise because of our unique expertise with our vehicle we recommend that our vehicle be serviced by our service center mobile service technician or certain authorized professional that we have specifically trained and equipped if we experience delay in adding such servicing capacity or experience unforeseen issue with the reliability of our vehicle particular higher volume and newer addition to our fleet such model and model it could overburden our servicing capability and part inventory finally the increasing number of tesla vehicle also requires to continue to rapidly increase the number of our supercharger station and connector throughout the world we are also expanding our installation capability for the solar roof we continue it manufacturing ramp by training both our own personnel and third party installers if we are not successful in growing this overall installation capability to keep pace with our increasing production or if we experience unforeseen delay in the production ramp or inaccurately forecast demand for the solar roof our operating result may be negatively impacted there is no assurance that we will be able to ramp our business to meet our sale delivery servicing charging and installation target globally that our projection on which such target are based will prove accurate or that the pace of growth or coverage of our customer infrastructure network will meet customer expectation moreover we may not be successful in undertaking this global expansion if we are unable to avoid cost overrun and other unexpected operating cost adapt our product and conduct our operation to meet local requirement and regulation implement required local infrastructure system and process and find and hire significant number of additional sale service electrical installation construction and administrative personnel if we fail to manage our growth effectively it could result in negative publicity and damage to our brand and have material adverse effect on our business prospect financial condition and operating result our future growth and success is dependent upon consumer willingness to adopt electric vehicle and specifically our vehicle we operate in the automotive industry which is generally susceptible to cyclicality and volatility our growth is highly dependent upon the worldwide adoption by consumer of alternative fuel vehicle in general and electric vehicle in particular although we have successfully grown demand for our vehicle thus far there is no guarantee of such future demand or that our vehicle will not compete with one another in the market moreover the target demographic for our vehicle in particular the mass market demographic for model and model are highly competitive if the market for electric vehicle in general and tesla vehicle in particular doe not develop we expect develops more slowly than we expect or if demand for our vehicle decrease in our market our business prospect financial condition and operating result could be harmed we have only relatively recently achieved high volume production of vehicle and are still at an earlier stage and have limited resource relative to our competitor moreover the market for alternative fuel vehicle is rapidly evolving result the market for our vehicle could be affected by numerous factor such perception about electric vehicle feature quality safety performance and cost perception about the limited range over which electric vehicle may be driven on single battery charge competition including from other type of alternative fuel vehicle plug in hybrid electric vehicle and high fuel economy internal combustion engine vehicle volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline government regulation and economic incentive access to charging facility and concern about our future viability in addition sale of vehicle in the automotive industry tend to be cyclical in many market which may expose to increased volatility especially we expand and adjust our operation and retail strategy specifically it is uncertain to such macroeconomic factor will impact company that ha been experiencing growth and increasing market share in an industry that ha globally been experiencing recent decline in sale we are dependent on our supplier the majority of which are single source supplier and the inability of these supplier to deliver necessary component of our product according to our schedule and at price quality level and volume acceptable to or our inability to efficiently manage these component could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating result our product contain thousand of purchased part that we source globally from hundred of direct supplier we attempt to mitigate our supply chain risk by entering into long term agreement where it is practical and beneficial to do so including agreement we entered into with panasonic to be our manufacturing partner and supplier qualifying and obtaining component from multiple source where sensible such the pv panel for our retrofit solar installation that we purchase from variety of supplier and maintaining safety stock for key part and assembly and die bank for component with lengthy procurement lead time however our limited and in most case single source supply chain expose to multiple potential source of delivery failure or component shortage for our production such those which we experienced in and in connection with our slower than planned model and model ramp furthermore unexpected change in business condition material pricing labor issue war governmental change tariff natural disaster such the march earthquake in japan health epidemic and other factor beyond our and our supplier control could also affect these supplier ability to deliver component to on timely basis the loss of any supplier particularly single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of component from our supplier could lead to product design change production delay of key revenue generating product idle manufacturing facility and potential loss of access to important technology and part for producing servicing and supporting our product any of which could result in negative publicity damage to our brand and material and adverse effect on our business prospect financial condition and operating result we may also be impacted by change in our supply chain or production need we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future cost increase from certain of our supplier in order to meet our quality target and development timeline well due to our design change likewise any significant increase in our production such for model and our expectation for model ha required and or may in the future require to procure additional component in short amount of time our supplier may not ultimately be able to sustainably and timely meet our cost quality and volume need requiring to replace them with other source while we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate source of supply for most of our component in relatively short time frame there is no assurance that we will be able to do so or develop our own replacement for certain highly customized component additionally we continuously negotiate with existing supplier to obtain cost reduction and avoid unfavorable change to term seek new and le expensive supplier for certain part and attempt to redesign certain part to make them le expensive to produce if we are unsuccessful in our effort to control and reduce supplier cost our operating result will suffer outside of the we have limited manufacturing experience and we may experience issue or delay increasing the level of localized procurement at our gigafactory shanghai and in the future at our gigafactory berlin furthermore the scale of our vehicle production increase we will need to accurately forecast purchase warehouse and transport component to our manufacturing facility and servicing location internationally and at much higher volume if we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantity of component purchase to our actual need or successfully implement automation inventory management and other system to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain we may incur unexpected production disruption storage transportation and write off cost which could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating result any problem or delay in expanding gigafactory nevada or ramping and maintaining operation there could negatively affect the production and profitability of our product such model model and our energy storage product in addition the battery cell produced there store large amount of energy to lower the cost of cell production and produce cell in high volume we have vertically integrated the production of lithium ion cell at gigafactory nevada where we also manufacture battery pack and drive unit for certain vehicle and energy storage product and assemble our megapack product production of lithium ion cell at gigafactory nevada began in and we have no other direct experience in the production of lithium ion cell given the size and complexity of this undertaking it is possible that future event could result in issue or delay in further ramping our product and expanding production output at gigafactory nevada in order to achieve our volume and gross margin target for our vehicle and energy storage product we must continue to sustain and ramp significant cell production at gigafactory nevada which among other thing requires panasonic to successfully operate and further ramp it cell production line at significant volume although panasonic ha long track record of producing high quality cell at significant volume at it factory in japan it ha relatively limited experience with cell production at gigafactory nevada in addition we produce several component for model and model such battery module incorporating the lithium ion cell produced by panasonic and drive unit including to support gigafactory shanghai production at gigafactory nevada some of the manufacturing line for such component took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity while we have largely overcome this bottleneck after deploying multiple semi automated line and improving our original line additional bottleneck may arise we continue to increase the production rate and introduce new line if we are unable to maintain gigafactory nevada production ramp output additionally over time needed and do so cost effectively or if we or panasonic are unable to hire and retain substantial number of highly skilled personnel our ability to supply battery pack or other component for model model and our other product could be negatively impacted which could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result in addition the high volume of lithium ion cell and battery module and pack manufactured at gigafactory nevada are stored and recycled at our various facility any mishandling of battery cell may cause disruption to the operation of such facility while we have implemented safety procedure related to the handling of the cell there can be no assurance that safety issue or fire related to the cell would not disrupt our operation such disruption or issue could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result any issue or delay in meeting our projected timeline cost and production at or funding the ramp of gigafactory shanghai or any difficulty in generating and maintaining local demand for vehicle manufactured there could adversely impact our business prospect operating result and financial condition part of our continuing work to increase production of our vehicle on sustained basis and in order to make them affordable in international market by accessing local supply chain and workforce we have established gigafactory shanghai in china currently we have installed annual production capacity for model vehicle there that we believe we will eventually be able to push to actual rate of production in excess of such number and we have commenced construction of the next phase of gigafactory shanghai to add model manufacturing capacity at least equivalent to that for model the ramp and further expansion of gigafactory shanghai are subject to number of uncertainty inherent in all new manufacturing operation including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirement maintenance of operational license and approval for additional expansion potential supply chain constraint hiring training and retention of qualified employee and the pace of bringing production equipment and process online with the capability to manufacture high quality unit at scale we have limited experience to date with operating manufacturing facility abroad and only recently began to sell model in china if we experience any issue or delay in meeting our projected timeline cost capital efficiency and production capacity for gigafactory shanghai or in maintaining and complying with the term of local debt financing that we intend will largely fund it or in generating and maintaining demand locally for the vehicle we manufacture at gigafactory shanghai our business prospect operating result and financial condition could be adversely impacted in particular local manufacturing is critical to our expansion and sale in china which is the largest market for electric vehicle in the world our vehicle sale in china have been negatively impacted in the past by certain tariff on automobile manufactured in the such our vehicle and our cost for producing our vehicle in the have also been affected by import duty on certain component sourced from china if we are not able to successfully and timely ramp gigafactory shanghai we may continue to be exposed to the impact of such unfavorable tariff duty or cost to our detriment compared to locally based competitor we face risk associated with our international operation including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory political economic tax and labor condition and with establishing ourselves in new market all of which could harm our business we have global footprint with domestic and international operation and subsidiary accordingly we are subject to variety of legal political and regulatory requirement and social environmental and economic condition over which we have little control for example we may be impacted by trade policy environmental condition political uncertainty and economic cycle involving geographic region where we have significant operation which are inherently unpredictable we are subject to number of risk associated in particular with international business activity that may increase our cost impact our ability to sell our product and require significant management attention these risk include conforming our product to various international regulatory and safety requirement well charging and other electric infrastructure organizing local operating entity difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operation challenge in attracting customer foreign government tax regulation and permit requirement our ability to enforce our contractual right trade restriction custom regulation tariff and price or exchange control and preference of foreign nation for domestically manufactured product increase in cost disruption of supply or shortage of material in particular for lithium ion cell could harm our business we may experience increase in the cost of or sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of material any such increase supply interruption or shortage could materially and negatively impact our business prospect financial condition and operating result we use various material in our business including aluminum steel lithium nickel copper and cobalt well lithium ion cell from supplier the price for these material fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable depending on market condition and global demand for these material including result of increased production of electric vehicle and energy storage product by our competitor and could adversely affect our business and operating result for instance we are exposed to multiple risk relating to lithium ion cell these risk include an increase in the cost or decrease in the available supply of material used in the cell disruption in the supply of cell due to quality issue or recall by battery cell manufacturer or any issue that may arise with respect to cell manufactured at our own facility and fluctuation in the value of any foreign currency in which battery cell and related raw material purchase are or may be denominated such the japanese yen against the dollar our business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cell for the battery pack used in our vehicle and energy storage product while we believe several source of the battery cell are available for such battery pack and expect to eventually rely substantially on battery cell manufactured at our own facility we have to date fully qualified only very limited number of supplier for the cell used in such battery pack and have very limited flexibility in changing cell supplier any disruption in the supply of battery cell from such supplier could disrupt production of our vehicle and of the battery pack we produce for energy product until such time different supplier is fully qualified furthermore fluctuation or shortage in petroleum and other economic condition may cause to experience significant increase in freight charge and material cost substantial increase in the price for our material or price charged to such those charged by battery cell supplier would increase our operating cost and could reduce our margin if we can not recoup the increased cost through increased vehicle price any attempt to increase product price in response to increased material cost could result in cancellation of order and reservation and therefore materially and adversely affect our brand image business prospect and operating result if our vehicle or other product that we sell or install fail to perform expected our ability to develop market and sell our product and service could be harmed if our vehicle or our energy product contain defect in design and manufacture that cause them not to perform expected or that require repair or certain feature of our vehicle such new autopilot or fsd feature take longer than expected to become enabled are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation our ability to develop market and sell our product and service could be harmed for example the operation of our vehicle is highly dependent on software which is inherently complex and may contain latent defect and error or be subject to external attack issue experienced by vehicle customer have included those related to the software for the inch display screen well the panoramic roof and the volt battery in the model and the seat and door in the model although we attempt to remedy any issue we observe in our product effectively and rapidly possible such effort may not be timely may hamper production or may not be to the satisfaction of our customer while we have performed extensive internal testing on the product we manufacture we currently have limited frame of reference by which to evaluate detailed long term quality reliability durability and performance characteristic of our battery pack powertrains vehicle and energy storage product there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defect in our product prior to their sale to or installation for customer any product defect delay or legal restriction on product feature or other failure of our product to perform expected could harm our reputation and result in delivery delay product recall product liability claim breach of warranty claim and significant warranty and other expense and could have material adverse impact on our business financial condition operating result and prospect we may become subject to product liability claim which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claim although we design our vehicle to be the safest vehicle on the road product liability claim even those without merit could harm our business prospect operating result and financial condition the automobile industry in particular experience significant product liability claim and we face inherent risk of exposure to claim in the event our vehicle do not perform or are claimed to not have performed expected is true for other automaker our vehicle have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in crash resulting in death or personal injury and such crash where autopilot or fsd feature are engaged are the subject of significant public attention we have experienced and we expect to continue to face claim arising from or related to misuse or claimed failure of new technology that we are pioneering including autopilot and fsd feature in our vehicle in addition the battery pack that we produce make use of lithium ion cell on rare occasion lithium ion cell can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flame in manner that can ignite nearby material well other lithium ion cell while we have designed the battery pack to passively contain any single cell release of energy without spreading to neighboring cell there can be no assurance that field or testing failure of our vehicle or other battery pack that we produce will not occur in particular due to high speed crash which could subject to lawsuit product recall or redesign effort all of which would be time consuming and expensive moreover our solar energy system and energy storage product generate and store electricity they have the potential to cause injury to people or property successful product liability claim against could require to pay substantial monetary award our risk in this area are particularly pronounced given the relatively limited number of vehicle and energy storage product delivered to date and limited field experience of our product moreover product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our product and business and could have material adverse effect on our brand business prospect and operating result in most jurisdiction we generally self insure against the risk of product liability claim for vehicle exposure meaning that any product liability claim will likely have to be paid from company fund not by insurance the market in which we operate are highly competitive and we may not be successful in competing in these industry we currently face competition from new and established domestic and international competitor and expect to face competition from others in the future including competition from company with new technology the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicle is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future there is no assurance that our vehicle will be successful in the respective market in which they compete significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturer well other company have entered or are reported to have plan to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market including hybrid plug in hybrid and fully electric vehicle well the market for self driving technology and application in some case such competitor have announced an intention to produce electric vehicle exclusively at some point in the future most of our current and potential competitor have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing vehicle sale resource and network than we do and may be able to devote greater resource to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their product in particular some competitor have also announced plan to compete with in important and large market for electric vehicle such china and in europe increased competition could result in lower vehicle unit sale price reduction revenue shortfall loss of customer and loss of market share which could harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result in addition model and model face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturer in the extremely competitive entry level premium sedan and compact suv market including bmw ford lexus mercedes and volkswagen group the solar and energy storage industry are highly competitive we face competition from other manufacturer developer and installers of solar and energy storage system well from large utility decrease in the retail price of electricity from utility or other renewable energy source could make our product le attractive to customer and lead to an increased rate of customer default under our existing long term lease and ppas moreover price for solar product component and price per kwh for lithium ion battery cell have declined and may continue to decline which may adversely impact our ability to cost effectively manufacture such component ourselves if we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our long term business prospect among consumer analyst and within our industry or are subject to negative publicity then our financial condition operating result business prospect and access to capital may suffer materially consumer may be le likely to purchase our product if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our service and support and other operation will continue in the long term similarly supplier and other third party will be le likely to invest time and resource in developing business relationship with if they are not convinced that our business will succeed accordingly in order to build and maintain our business we must maintain confidence among customer supplier analyst rating agency and other party in our long term financial viability and business prospect maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by certain factor including those that are largely outside of our control such our limited operating history customer unfamiliarity with our product any delay in scaling manufacturing delivery and service operation to meet demand competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicle or our other product and service and our quarterly production and sale performance compared with market expectation in particular tesla product business result of operation statement and action are well publicized by range of third party such attention includes frequent criticism which is often exaggerated or unfounded such speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team any such negative perception whether caused by or not could harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional fund if needed if we fail to effectively grow and manage the residual financing and credit risk related to our vehicle financing program our business may suffer we offer financing arrangement for our vehicle in north america europe and asia primarily through various financial institution we also currently offer leasing directly through our local subsidiary for model model and model in the and for model and model in canada under lease held directly by we typically receive only very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease followed by stream of payment over the term of the lease the profitability of any vehicle returned to at the end of their lease depends on our ability to accurately project our vehicle residual value at the outset of the lease and such value may fluctuate prior to the end of their term depending on various factor such supply and demand of our used vehicle economic cycle and the pricing of new vehicle for example we made certain adjustment to our vehicle price during to reflect anticipated change to our cost structure from periodically optimizing our retail strategy and limited accommodation to customer in consideration of reduction in the electric vehicle federal tax credit such pricing change may impact the residual value of our vehicle the leasing program also relies on our ability to secure adequate financing and or business partner to fund and grow this program and screen for and manage customer credit risk we expect the availability of leasing and other financing option will be important for our vehicle customer if we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program with internal fund or partner or other external financing source and compelling alternative financing program are not available for our customer we may be unable to grow our delivery furthermore if our leasing business grows substantially our business may suffer if we can not effectively manage the greater level of residual and credit risk resulting from growth finally if we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national state and or local financial regulation and consumer protection law governing lease transaction we may become subject to enforcement action or penalty either of which may harm our business moreover we have provided resale value guarantee to customer and partner for certain financing program under which such counterparties may sell their vehicle back to at certain point in time at pre determined amount however actual resale value with residual value for leased vehicle are subject to similar fluctuation over the term of the financing arrangement such from the vehicle pricing change discussed if the actual resale value of any vehicle resold or returned to pursuant to these program are materially lower than the pre determined amount we have offered our operating result profitability and or liquidity could be negatively impacted the unavailability reduction or elimination of or unfavorable determination with respect to government and economic incentive in the and abroad supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicle energy storage product or solar energy could have some impact on demand for our product and service we and our customer currently benefit from certain government and economic incentive supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicle in the and abroad such incentive include tax credit or rebate that encourage the purchase of electric vehicle specific policy in place around the world include exempting the purchase of electric vehicle from import tax value added tax or carbon dioxide and weight based purchase tax such program could be reduced eliminated or exhausted for example under current regulation federal tax credit that wa available in the for the purchase of our vehicle wa reduced in phase during and ended on december we believe that this sequential phase out likely pulled forward some vehicle demand into the period preceding each reduction moreover in july previously available incentive for purchase of model in ontario canada wa cancelled and tesla buyer in germany lost access to electric vehicle incentive for short period of time beginning late in april and january respectively previously available incentive in hong kong and denmark that favored the purchase of electric vehicle expired negatively impacting sale effective march california implemented regulation phasing out cash rebate on qualified electric vehicle for high income consumer such development could have some negative impact on demand for our vehicle and we and our customer may have to adjust to them in addition certain governmental rebate tax credit and other financial incentive that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy storage product business allow to lower our cost and encourage customer to buy our product and investor to invest in our solar financing fund however these incentive may expire on particular date when the allocated funding is exhausted reduced or terminated renewable energy adoption rate increase sometimes without warning for example the federal government currently offer an investment tax credit itc for the installation of solar power facility and energy storage system that are charged from co sited solar power facility however the itc is currently scheduled to decline in phase from for qualifying solar system for which construction began by december to for commercial and utility system and to for customer owned residential system for which construction begin after december likewise in jurisdiction where net energy metering is currently available our customer receive bill credit from utility for energy that their solar energy system generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use several jurisdiction have reduced altered or eliminated the benefit available under net energy metering or have proposed to do so such reduction in or termination of governmental incentive could adversely impact our result by making our product le competitive for potential customer increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partner and to form new financing fund for our solar and energy storage asset moreover we and our fund investor claim the itc and certain state incentive in amount based on the fair market value of our solar and energy storage system although we obtain independent appraisal to support the claimed fair market value the relevant governmental authority have audited such value and in certain case have determined that they should be lower and they may do so in the future such determination may result in adverse tax consequence and or our obligation to make indemnification or other payment to our fund or fund investor any failure by to comply with the term of our agreement with the research foundation for the state university of new york relating to our gigafactory new york could result in negative consequence for our business we are party to an operating lease and research and development agreement through the suny foundation these agreement provide for the construction and use of our gigafactory in buffalo new york which we have primarily used for the development and production of our solar roof and other solar product and component energy storage component and supercharger component and for other lessor approved function under this agreement we are obligated to among other thing directly employ specified minimum number of personnel in the state of new york and spend or incur billion in combined capital operational expense cost of good sold and other cost in the state of new york during the year period beginning april while we expect significant operation at gigafactory new york and the surrounding buffalo area to continue including with our ramp and manufacture of the solar roof if we fail in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet these obligation we would be obligated to pay program payment of million to the suny foundation for such year any inability on our part to comply with the requirement of this agreement may result in the payment of significant amount to the suny foundation the termination of our lease at gigafactory new york and or the need to adjust certain of our operation in particular our production ramp of the solar roof or supercharger component any of the foregoing event could have material adverse effect on our business prospect financial condition and operating result if we are unable to attract and or retain key employee and hire qualified personnel our ability to compete could be harmed the loss of the service of any of our key employee could disrupt our operation delay the development and introduction of our vehicle and service and negatively impact our business prospect and operating result in particular we are highly dependent on the service of elon musk our chief executive officer none of our key employee is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain executive officer and other key technology sale marketing engineering manufacturing and support personnel especially to support our high volume manufacture of vehicle expansion plan and technological innovation and any failure or delay in doing so could adversely impact our business prospect financial condition and operating result key talent may leave tesla due to various factor such very competitive labor market for talented individual with automotive or technology experience or any negative publicity related to in california nevada and other region where we have operation including outside of the there is increasing competition for individual with skillsets needed for our business including specialized knowledge of electric vehicle software engineering manufacturing engineering and other skill such electrical and building construction expertise this competition affect our ability to retain and hire key employee moreover we have in the past conducted reduction in force in order to optimize our organizational structure and reduce cost and certain senior personnel have also departed for various reason our continued success depends upon our continued ability to hire new employee in timely manner especially to support our expansion plan and to retain current employee or replace departed senior employee with qualified and experienced individual which is typically time consuming process additionally we compete with both mature and prosperous company that have far greater financial resource than we do and start ups and emerging company that promise short term growth opportunity difficulty in retaining or recruiting employee could have an adverse effect on our performance and result finally our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origin with an emphasis on equity based award and benefit in order to closely align their incentive with the long term interest of our stockholder we have to periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholder for future increase to the number of award that may be granted and share that may be purchased under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plan if we are unable to obtain the requisite stockholder approval to obtain future increase to the number of award that may be granted and share that may be purchased under such plan and compensate our personnel in accordance with our compensation philosophy our ability to retain and hire qualified personnel would be negatively impacted we are highly dependent on the service of elon musk our chief executive officer we are highly dependent on the service of elon musk our chief executive officer and largest stockholder although mr musk spends significant time with tesla and is highly active in our management doe not devote full time and attention to tesla mr musk also currently serf chief executive officer and chief technical officer of space exploration technology corp developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicle and is involved in other emerging technology venture we are continuously expanding and improving our information technology system and use security measure designed to protect our system against breach and cyber attack if these effort are not successful our business and operation could be disrupted or our intellectual property could be compromised result of which our operating result and reputation could be harmed we are continuously expanding and improving our information technology system including implementing new internally developed system and deploying such system globally to assist in the management of our business in particular our volume production of multiple vehicle necessitates continued development maintenance and improvement of our information technology system in the and abroad including at gigafactory shanghai such system for product data management procurement inventory management production planning and execution sale service and logistics dealer management financial tax and regulatory compliance system we also maintain information technology measure designed to protect against intellectual property theft data breach and other cyber attack the implementation maintenance segregation and improvement of these system require significant management time support and cost moreover there are inherent risk associated with developing improving and expanding our core system well implementing new system and updating current system including the disruption of our data management procurement manufacturing execution finance supply chain and sale and service process these risk may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory procure part or supply or manufacture sell deliver and service vehicle adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with or realize available benefit under tax law and other applicable regulation we can not be sure that these system or their required functionality will be effectively implemented maintained or expanded planned if we do not successfully implement maintain or expand these system planned our operation may be disrupted our ability to accurately and or timely report our financial result could be impaired and deficiency may arise in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact our ability to certify our financial result moreover our proprietary information or intellectual property could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected if these system or their functionality do not operate we expect them to we may be required to expend significant resource to make correction or find alternative source for performing these function any unauthorized control or manipulation of our product system could result in loss of confidence in and our product and harm our business our product contain complex information technology system for example our vehicle and energy storage product are designed with built in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote update from to improve or update their functionality we have designed implemented and tested security measure intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology network our product and their system however hacker have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such network product and system to gain control of or to change our product functionality user interface and performance characteristic or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our product we encourage reporting of potential vulnerability in the security of our product via our security vulnerability reporting policy and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability accordingly we have received report of potential vulnerability in the past and have attempted to remedy them however there can be no assurance that vulnerability will not be exploited in the future before they can be identified or that our remediation effort are or will be successful any unauthorized access to or control of our product or their system or any loss of data could result in legal claim or proceeding in addition regardless of their veracity report of unauthorized access to our product their system or data well other factor that may result in the perception that our product their system or data are capable of being hacked could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result we have been the subject of such report in the past we are subject to substantial law and regulation that could impose substantial cost legal prohibition or unfavorable change upon our operation or product and any failure to comply with these law and regulation including they evolve could negatively impact our ability to operate our manufacturing facility and substantially harm our business and operating result manufacturing company including with respect to our current facility such the fremont factory gigafactory nevada gigafactory new york and gigafactory shanghai and our future facility at gigafactory berlin we are or will be subject to complex environmental manufacturing health and safety law and regulation at numerous jurisdictional level in the china germany and other location abroad including law relating to the use handling storage recycling disposal and human exposure to hazardous material and with respect to constructing expanding and maintaining our facility the cost of compliance including remediating contamination if any is found on our property and any change to our operation mandated by new or amended law may be significant we may also face unexpected delay in obtaining permit and approval required by such law in connection with our manufacturing facility which would hinder our operation of these facility such cost and delay may adversely impact our business prospect and operating result furthermore any violation of these law may result in substantial fine and penalty remediation cost third party damage or suspension or cessation of our operation in addition motor vehicle are subject to substantial regulation under international federal state and local law we incur significant cost in complying with these regulation and may be required to incur additional cost to comply with any change to such regulation and any failure to comply could result in significant expense delay or fine we are subject to law and regulation applicable to the supply manufacture import sale and service of automobile internationally for example in country outside of the we are required to meet standard relating to vehicle safety fuel economy and emission among other thing that are often materially different from requirement in the thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicle and system to ensure regulatory compliance in those country this process may include official review and certification of our vehicle by foreign regulatory agency prior to market entry well compliance with foreign reporting and recall management system requirement in particular we offer in our vehicle autopilot and fsd feature that today assist driver with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspect of road travel but which currently require driver to remain engaged we are continuing to develop our fsd technology with the goal of achieving full self driving capability in the future there is variety of international federal and state regulation that may apply to self driving vehicle which include many existing vehicle standard that were not originally intended to apply to vehicle that may not have driver such regulation continue to rapidly change which increase the likelihood of patchwork of complex or conflicting regulation or may delay product or restrict self driving feature and availability any of which could adversely affect our business finally manufacturer and installer of solar generation and energy storage system and supplier of electricity generated and stored by the solar energy and energy storage system we install for customer we are impacted by federal state and local regulation and policy concerning electricity pricing the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electric grid and the sale of electricity generated by third party owned system for example existing or proposed regulation and policy would permit utility to limit the amount of electricity generated by our customer with their solar energy system charge fee and penalty to our customer relating to the purchase of energy other than from the grid adjust electricity rate design such that the price of our solar product may not be competitive with that of electricity from the grid restrict and our customer from transacting under our ppas or qualifying for government incentive and benefit that apply to solar power and limit or eliminate net energy metering if such regulation and policy are adopted or if other regulation and policy that adversely impact the interconnection or use of our solar and energy storage system are introduced they could deter potential customer from purchasing our solar and energy storage product threaten the economics of our existing contract and cause to cease solar and energy storage system sale and operation in the relevant jurisdiction which could harm our business prospect financial condition and result of operation failure to comply with variety of and international privacy and consumer protection law to which we are subject could harm the company our privacy policy is posted on our website and any failure by or our vendor or other business partner to comply with it or with federal state or international privacy data protection or security law or regulation relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigation related action against legal liability fine damage ongoing audit requirement and other significant cost substantial expense and operational change may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such law and in particular certain emerging privacy law are still subject to high degree of uncertainty to their interpretation and application for example in may the general data protection regulation began to fully apply to the processing of personal information collected from individual located in the european union and ha created new compliance obligation and ha significantly increased fine for noncompliance similarly beginning in january the california consumer privacy act imposes certain legal obligation on our use and processing of personal information related to california resident although we take step to protect the security and integrity of our customer personal information we may be required to expend significant resource to comply with data breach requirement if third party improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customer or we otherwise experience data loss with respect to customer personal information major breach of our network security and system could have negative consequence for our business and future prospect including possible fine penalty and damage reduced customer demand for our vehicle and harm to our reputation and brand our business may be adversely affected by any disruption caused by union activity it is not uncommon for employee of certain trade at company such to belong to union which can result in higher employee cost and increased risk of work stoppage moreover regulation in some jurisdiction outside of the mandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreement and work council with certain consultation right with respect to the relevant company operation although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employee they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form labor union or we may be required to become union signatory from time to time labor union have engaged in campaign to organize certain of our operation part of which such union have filed unfair labor practice charge against with the national labor relation board and they may do so in the future in september an administrative law judge issued recommended decision for tesla on certain issue and against on certain others the national labor relation board ha not yet adopted the recommendation and we have appealed certain aspect of the recommended decision any unfavorable ultimate outcome for tesla may have negative impact on the perception of tesla treatment of our employee furthermore we are directly or indirectly dependent upon company with unionized work force such part supplier and trucking and freight company and work stoppage or strike organized by such union could have material adverse impact on our business financial condition or operating result if work stoppage occurs it could delay the manufacture and sale of our product and have material adverse effect on our business prospect operating result or financial condition we may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recall or take other similar action which could adversely affect our brand image and financial performance any product recall with respect to our product may result in adverse publicity damage our brand and adversely affect our business prospect operating result and financial condition for example certain vehicle recall that we initiated have resulted from various cause including component that could prevent the parking brake from releasing once engaged concern with the firmware in the restraint control module in certain right hand drive vehicle industry wide issue with airbags from particular supplier model seat component that could cause unintended seat movement during collision and concern of corrosion in model and model power steering assist motor bolt furthermore testing of our product by government regulator or industry group may require to initiate product recall or may result in negative public perception about the safety of our product in the future we may at various time voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recall if any of our product or our electric vehicle powertrain component that we have provided to other vehicle oems including any system or part sourced from our supplier prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable law and regulation such federal motor vehicle safety standard such recall whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by system or component engineered or manufactured by or our supplier could involve significant expense and could adversely affect our brand image in our target market well our business prospect financial condition and result of operation our current and future warranty reserve may be insufficient to cover future warranty claim which could adversely affect our financial performance we provide manufacturer warranty on all new and used tesla vehicle and production powertrain component and system we sell in addition we also provide warranty on the installation and component of the energy generation and storage system we sell and we pas through to our customer the inverter and panel manufacturer warranty finally we offer performance guarantee with our leased solar energy system that compensates customer on an annual basis if their system doe not meet the electricity production guarantee set forth in their ppa or lease under these performance guarantee we bear the risk of electricity production shortfall resulting from an inverter or panel failure these risk are exacerbated in the event the panel or inverter manufacturer cease operation or fail to honor their warranty if our warranty reserve are inadequate to cover future warranty claim on our product our business prospect financial condition and operating result could be materially and adversely affected warranty reserve include our management best estimate of the projected cost to repair or to replace item under warranty these estimate are based on actual claim incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and cost of future claim such estimate are inherently uncertain and change to our historical or projected experience especially with respect to product such model model and the solar roof that we have recently introduced and or that we expect to produce at significantly greater volume than our past product may cause material change to our warranty reserve in the future our insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect from all business risk we may be subject in the ordinary course of business to loss resulting from product liability accident act of god and other claim against for which we may have no insurance coverage general matter we do not maintain much insurance coverage many other company do and in some case we do not maintain any at all additionally the policy that we do have may include significant deductible or self insured retention and we can not be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future loss or claim against loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limit may require to pay substantial amount which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating result our financial result may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuation in our operating cost and other factor we expect our period to period financial result to vary based on our operating cost which we anticipate will fluctuate the pace at which we continue to design develop and manufacture new product and increase production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facility and adding future facility may not be consistent or linear between period additionally our revenue from period to period may fluctuate we introduce existing product to new market for the first time and we develop and introduce new product result of these factor we believe that quarter to quarter comparison of our financial result especially in the short term are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparison can not be relied upon indicator of future performance moreover our financial result may not meet expectation of equity research analyst rating agency or investor who may be focused only on quarterly financial result if any of this occurs the trading price of our stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time servicing our indebtedness requires significant amount of cash and there is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness of december we and our subsidiary had outstanding billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness see note debt to the consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form our substantial consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry condition we and our subsidiary may subject to the limitation in the term of our existing and future indebtedness incur additional debt secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt pursuant to their term holder of our convertible senior note due convertible senior note due and convertible senior note due together the tesla convertible note may convert their respective tesla convertible note at their option prior to the scheduled maturity of the respective tesla convertible note under certain circumstance upon conversion of the applicable tesla convertible note we will be obligated to deliver cash and or share in respect of the principal amount thereof and the conversion value in excess of such principal amount on such tesla convertible note moreover our subsidiary zero coupon convertible senior note due the subsidiary convertible note are convertible into share of our common stock at conversion price of per share finally holder of the tesla convertible note and the subsidiary convertible note will have the right to require to repurchase their note upon the occurrence of fundamental change at purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the note plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but not including the fundamental change purchase date our ability to make scheduled payment of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due or to make payment upon conversion or repurchase demand with respect to our convertible note or to refinance our indebtedness we may need or desire depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factor beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operation in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligation under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditure if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternative such reducing or delaying investment or capital expenditure selling asset refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on term that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital market and our financial condition at such time in addition our ability to make payment may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreement governing our future indebtedness we may not be able to engage in any of these activity or engage in these activity on desirable term or at all which could result in default on our existing or future indebtedness and have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition our debt agreement contain covenant restriction that may limit our ability to operate our business the term of certain of our credit facility including the credit agreement contain and any of our other future debt agreement may contain covenant restriction that limit our ability to operate our business including restriction on our ability to among other thing incur additional debt or issue guarantee create lien repurchase stock or make other restricted payment and make certain voluntary prepayment of specified debt in addition under certain circumstance we are required to comply with fixed charge coverage ratio result of these covenant our ability to respond to change in business and economic condition and engage in beneficial transaction including to obtain additional financing needed may be restricted furthermore our failure to comply with our debt covenant could result in default under our debt agreement which could permit the holder to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient fund available to repay it we may need or want to raise additional fund and these fund may not be available to when we need them if we can not raise additional fund when we need or want them our operation and prospect could be negatively affected the design manufacture sale installation and or servicing of automobile energy storage product and solar product is capital intensive business and the specific timing of cash inflow and outflow may fluctuate substantially from period to period until we are consistently generating positive free cash flow we may need or want to raise additional fund through the issuance of equity equity related or debt security or through obtaining credit from financial institution to fund together with our principal source of liquidity the cost of developing and manufacturing our current or future vehicle energy storage product and or solar product to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expense or for new significant strategic investment or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness even if not required to do so by the term of such indebtedness we need sufficient capital to fund ongoing operation research and development project for new product establishment and or increase of model and model production capacity at the fremont factory and at gigafactory shanghai the continued expansion of gigafactory nevada the construction of gigafactory berlin the manufacturing ramp of the solar roof at gigafactory new york and the continued expansion of our retail and service location body shop mobile service fleet and supercharger network we can not be certain that additional fund will be available to on favorable term when required or at all if we can not raise additional fund when we need them our financial condition result of operation business and prospect could be materially and adversely affected we could be subject to liability penalty and other restrictive sanction and adverse consequence arising out of certain governmental investigation and proceeding we are cooperating with certain government investigation discussed in note commitment and contingency to the consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form to our knowledge no government agency in any such ongoing investigation ha concluded that any wrongdoing occurred however we can not predict the outcome or impact of any such ongoing matter and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability penalty and other restrictive sanction and adverse consequence if the sec the doj or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future moreover we expect to incur cost in responding to related request for information and subpoena and if instituted in defending against any governmental proceeding for example on october the district court for the southern district of new york entered final judgment approving the term of settlement filed with the court on september in connection with the action taken by the sec relating to mr musk statement on august that he wa considering taking tesla private pursuant to the settlement we among other thing paid civil penalty of million appointed an independent director the chair of the board appointed two additional independent director to our board of director and made further enhancement to our disclosure control and other corporate governance related matter on april this settlement wa amended to clarify certain of the previously agreed disclosure procedure which wa subsequently approved by the court all other term of the prior settlement were reaffirmed without modification although we intend to continue to comply with the term and requirement of the settlement if there is lack of compliance or an alleged lack of compliance additional enforcement action or other legal proceeding may be instituted against if we update or discontinue the use of our manufacturing equipment more quickly than expected we may have to shorten the useful life of any equipment to be retired result of any such update and the resulting acceleration in our depreciation could negatively affect our financial result we have invested and expect to continue to invest significantly in we believe is state of the art tooling machinery and other manufacturing equipment for our various product line and we depreciate the cost of such equipment over their expected useful life however manufacturing technology may evolve rapidly and we may decide to update our manufacturing process with cutting edge equipment more quickly than expected moreover we are continually implementing learning our engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency increase which may result in our ability to manufacture our product using le of our currently installed equipment alternatively we ramp and mature the production of our product to higher level our learning may cause to discontinue the use of already installed equipment in favor of different or additional equipment the useful life of any equipment that would be retired early result would be shortened causing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated and our result of operation could be negatively impacted we are exposed to fluctuation in currency exchange rate which could negatively affect our financial result we transact business globally in multiple currency and have foreign currency risk related to our revenue cost of revenue and operating expense denominated in currency other than the dollar primarily the euro japanese yen canadian dollar chinese yuan and norwegian krone to the extent we have significant revenue denominated in such foreign currency any strengthening of the dollar would tend to reduce our revenue measured in dollar we have historically experienced in addition portion of our cost and expense have been and we anticipate will continue to be denominated in foreign currency including the japanese yen if we do not have fully offsetting revenue in these currency and if the value of the dollar depreciates significantly against these currency our cost measured in dollar percent of our revenue will correspondingly increase and our margin will suffer moreover while we undertake limited hedging activity intended to offset the impact of currency translation exposure it is impossible to predict or eliminate such impact result our operating result could be adversely affected we may face regulatory limitation on our ability to sell vehicle directly which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicle we sell our vehicle directly to consumer using mean that we believe will maximize our reach currently including through our website and our own store while we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sale strategy we may not be able to sell our vehicle through our own store in each state in the some state have law that may be interpreted to impose limitation on this direct to consumer sale model in some state we have also opened gallery to educate and inform customer about our product but such location do not actually transact in the sale of vehicle the application of these state law to our operation continues to be difficult to predict law in some state have limited our ability to obtain dealer license from state motor vehicle regulator and may continue to do so in addition decision by regulator permitting to sell vehicle may be challenged by dealer association and others to whether such decision comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry law we have prevailed in many of these lawsuit and such result have reinforced our continuing belief that state law were not designed to prevent our distribution model in some state there have also been regulatory and legislative effort by dealer association to propose law that if enacted would prevent from obtaining dealer license in their state given our current sale model few state have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate but at the same time limit the number of dealer license we can obtain or store that we can operate internationally there may be law in jurisdiction we have not yet entered or law we are unaware of in jurisdiction we have entered that may restrict our sale or other business practice even for those jurisdiction we have analyzed the law in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time continued regulatory limitation and other obstacle interfering with our ability to sell vehicle directly to consumer could have negative and material impact our business prospect financial condition and result of operation we may need to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claim which may be time consuming and could cause to incur substantial cost others including our competitor may hold or obtain patent copyright trademark or other proprietary right that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use develop sell or market our product and service which could make it more difficult for to operate our business from time to time the holder of such intellectual property right may assert their right and urge to take license and or may bring suit alleging infringement or misappropriation of such right while we endeavor to obtain and protect the intellectual property right that we expect will allow to retain or advance our strategic initiative there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately identify and protect the portion of intellectual property that are strategic to our business or mitigate the risk of potential suit or other legal demand by our competitor accordingly we may consider the entering into licensing agreement with respect to such right although no assurance can be given that such license can be obtained on acceptable term or that litigation will not occur and such license and associated litigation could significantly increase our operating expense in addition if we are determined to have or believe there is high likelihood that we have infringed upon third party intellectual property right we may be required to cease making selling or incorporating certain component or intellectual property into the good and service we offer to pay substantial damage and or license royalty to redesign our product and service and or to establish and maintain alternative branding for our product and service in the event that we were required to take one or more such action our business prospect operating result and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition any litigation or claim whether or not valid could result in substantial cost negative publicity and diversion of resource and management attention our facility or operation could be adversely affected by event outside of our control such natural disaster war or health epidemic we may be impacted by natural disaster war health epidemic or other event outside of our control for example our corporate headquarters the fremont factory and gigafactory nevada are located in seismically active region in northern california and nevada and our gigafactory shanghai is located in flood prone area if major disaster such earthquake flood or other event occur or our information system or communication network break down or operates improperly our headquarters and production facility may be seriously damaged or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our product in addition beginning in late the medium ha reported public health epidemic originating in china prompting precautionary government imposed closure of certain travel and business gigafactory shanghai wa closed for brief time result before it reopened in february and rejoined our factory which had continued to operate it is unknown whether and how global supply chain particularly for automotive part may be affected if such an epidemic persists for an extended period of time we may incur expense or delay relating to such event outside of our control which could have material adverse impact on our business operating result and financial condition risk related to the ownership of our common stock the trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile the trading price of our common stock ha been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuation in response to various factor some of which are beyond our control our common stock ha experienced an intra day trading high of per share and low of per share over the last week the stock market in general and the market for technology company in particular ha experienced extreme price and volume fluctuation that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those company in particular large proportion of our common stock ha been and may continue to be traded by short seller which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock further influencing volatility in it market price public perception and other factor outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of company like that garner disproportionate degree of public attention regardless of actual operating performance in addition in the past following period of volatility in the overall market and the market price of particular company security security class action litigation ha often been instituted against these company moreover stockholder litigation like this ha been filed against in the past while we defend such action vigorously any judgment against or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of our management attention and resource we may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectation about our business which could cause our stock price to decline we may provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance which may include projection regarding sale and production well anticipated future revenue gross margin profitability and cash flow correctly identifying key factor affecting business condition and predicting future event is inherently an uncertain process and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate and ha in the past been inaccurate in certain respect such the timing of new product manufacturing ramp our guidance is based on certain assumption such those relating to anticipated production and sale volume which generally are not linear throughout given period average sale price supplier and commodity cost and planned cost reduction if our guidance is not accurate or varies from actual result due to our inability to meet our assumption or the impact on our financial performance that could occur result of various risk and uncertainty the market value of our common stock could decline significantly transaction relating to our convertible note may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholder or may otherwise depress the price of our common

their scheduled term under certain circumstance if holder elect to convert their convertible note we could be required to deliver to them significant number of share of our common stock any sale in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market price of our common stock in addition the existence of the convertible note may encourage short selling by market participant because the conversion of such note could be used to satisfy short position or anticipated conversion of such note into share of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock moreover in connection with each issuance of the tesla convertible note we entered into convertible note hedge transaction which are expected to reduce the potential dilution and or offset potential cash payment we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the applicable tesla convertible note we also entered into warrant transaction with the hedge counterparties which could separately have dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrant on the applicable expiration date in addition the hedge counterparties or their affiliate may enter into various transaction with respect to their hedge position which could also cause or

fiscal year related item refer to part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation in our annual report on form for fiscal year which wa filed with the security and exchange commission on february overview and highlight our mission is to accelerate the world transition to sustainable energy we design develop manufacture lease and sell high performance fully electric vehicle solar energy generation system and energy storage product we also offer maintenance installation operation and other service related to our product automotive during we achieved annual vehicle delivery and production record of and total vehicle respectively we also laid the groundwork for our next phase of growth with the commencement of model production at gigafactory shanghai preparation at the fremont factory for model production which commenced in the first quarter of the selection of berlin germany the site for our next factory for the european market and the unveiling of cybertruck we also continued to enhance our user experience through improved autopilot and fsd feature including the introduction of new powerful on board fsd computer and new smart summon feature and the expansion of unique set of in car entertainment option energy generation and storage we revamped key aspect of our solar operation in by streamlining traditionally complex ordering permitting installation and back end service process to enhance the customer experience especially for retrofit solar installation our solar deployment grew approximately and quarter over quarter in the second half of the year we also deployed gwh of energy storage in more than the aggregate of all prior year finally we further evolved our product offering by launching the third generation of the solar roof for which we are expanding both our manufacturing and installation capability and megapack our largest utility scale energy storage product to date management opportunity challenge and risk and outlook automotive production key focus in will be our effort towards establishing and expanding capacity for vehicle production at volume across three continent at the fremont factory we commenced model production earlier than anticipated and combined with model we have installed annual production capacity for vehicle we expect to further increase this capacity to vehicle through the installation of additional equipment at gigafactory shanghai we have installed annual production capacity for model vehicle that we believe we will eventually be able to push to actual rate of production in excess of such number subject to local production of battery pack which we began ramping there later than other process we have commenced construction of the next phase of gigafactory shanghai to add model manufacturing capacity at least equivalent to that for model to finance our construction and expansion in december our local subsidiary entered into rmb billion or the equivalent amount in dollar fixed asset term facility and rmb billion or the equivalent amount in dollar working capital revolving facility part of which wa used to repay rmb billion bridge loan entered into in march we are supplementing such financing with limited direct capital expenditure finally we have selected germany the site of our next factory for manufacturing vehicle for the european market due to it strong manufacturing and engineering presence however the construction of and ramp at gigafactory berlin well at gigafactory shanghai are subject to number of uncertainty inherent in all new manufacturing operation including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirement maintenance of operational license and approval for additional expansion potential supply chain constraint hiring training and retention of qualified employee and the pace of bringing production equipment and process online with the capability to manufacture high quality unit at scale ultimately achieving increased total vehicle production cost effectively across all of our manufacturing operation will require that we timely address any bottleneck that may arise we ramp establish and maintain sustained supplier capacity and successfully utilize manufacturing process at the maximum output rate that we have planned for them automotive demand and sale the automotive industry continues to validate and grow the market for electric vehicle we are generating demand and new customer even without traditional marketing and with relatively low marketing cost and in our order shifted to originating mostly from new customer without prior reservation production at gigafactory shanghai allows to offer model in china at competitive local pricing and more quickly which should drive further demand and opportunity in the world largest market for mid sized premium sedan and we expect similar impact in china for model when we commence production there of this offering in the popular compact suv segment moreover the significant interest generated by our unveiling of cybertruck demonstrated our brand visibility innovation and viability across an increasing range of vehicle segment meanwhile we are making our existing vehicle incrementally more compelling including through planned software update for fsd enabled vehicle to react to traffic light and stop sign and navigate city intersection and additional functionality of both in vehicle software and the tesla mobile app on the other hand we may be impacted by trade and environmental policy political uncertainty and economic cycle involving geographic region where we have significant operation which are inherently unpredictable sale of vehicle in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many market which may expose to increased volatility specifically it is uncertain to how such macroeconomic factor will impact company that ha been experiencing growth and increasing market share in an industry that ha globally been experiencing recent decline in sale finally we make certain adjustment to our price from time to time in the ordinary course of business including we introduce new vehicle and variant and optimize the pricing among them such pricing change may impact our vehicle resale value and in turn our operating result for example if price reduction result in an increase to our estimate of the volume of vehicle that may potentially be returned to under pre existing resale value guarantee provided to customer and partner for certain financing program our gross profit may be reduced automotive delivery and customer infrastructure we continue to optimize our manufacturing and global delivery pattern to address higher volume of our predominantly single factory production at the fremont factory we expect to alleviate any related issue through local production at gigafactory shanghai and eventually at gigafactory berlin we also continue to expand and invest in our servicing and charging location and capability to keep pace with our customer vehicle fleet and ensure convenient and efficient customer experience however if our customer vehicle particularly in the rapidly growing model fleet experience unexpected reliability issue it could outpace and overburden our servicing capability and part inventory energy generation and storage demand production and deployment we expect to continue to grow our retrofit solar system deployment we execute our new strategy including through compelling financing option such subscription based offering which is currently available in california we are focused on training our personnel and third party partner to ramp installation of our solar roof and are also hiring rapidly for it ongoing manufacturing ramp at gigafactory new york we expect such ramp will support our significant operation and our compliance with minimum hiring and cumulative investment target under our agreement with the suny foundation related to the construction and use of gigafactory new york however if our expectation to the cost and timeline of our investment and operation at buffalo or our production ramp of the solar roof prove incorrect we may incur additional expense or substantial payment to the suny foundation finally with the introduction of our mwh megapack we offer an even greater variety of scalable energy storage product with wide range of market and application and expect this product to drive additional interest from global project developer and utility trend in cash flow capital expenditure and operating expense our capital expenditure are difficult to project beyond the short term given the number and breadth of our core project at any given time for example the curve of any new product ramp such for model and the solar roof is inherently subject to uncertainty of timing and if we are able to meet various milestone along such ramp more quickly than expected our capital expenditure may be accelerated we also continuously evaluate and appropriate adjust our capital expenditure based on among other thing our manufacturing plan for our various product which we may rebalance from time to time based on the mix of demand among them and other contingent factor the pace and prioritization of current project under development and the addition of any new project moreover we are generally increasing the capital efficiency of our project with experience and we may find that our actual capital expenditure on new project are different than previously expected subject to the above considering the expected pace of the manufacturing ramp for our product construction and expansion of our factory and pipeline of announced project under development and consistent with our current strategy of using partner to manufacture battery cell well considering all other infrastructure growth we currently expect our average annual capital expenditure in and the two succeeding fiscal year to be billion to billion we expect operating expense percentage of revenue to continue to decrease in the future we focus on increasing operational efficiency and process automation well from increase in expected overall revenue from our expanding sale in particular our effort to scale down and optimize our cost structure relative to the size of our business have already manifested in total operating expense decreasing from billion to billion from fiscal year to fiscal year including restructuring and other charge meanwhile our total revenue increased from billion to billion in the same period in march our stockholder approved the ceo performance award with vesting contingent on achieving market capitalization and operational milestone we will incur significant non cash stock based compensation expense for each tranche under this award after the related operational milestone initially becomes probable of being met and if later than the grant date we will also have to record cumulative catch up expense at such time such catch up expense may be material depending on the length of time elapsed from the grant date for example in the fourth quarter of the result of an additional operational milestone becoming probable of achievement we recorded cumulative catch up expense of million for service provided from the grant date moreover the expense for tranche is recorded over the longer of the expected achievement period of the relevant operational milestone and ii only if the related market capitalization milestone ha not been achieved it expected achievement period the achievement of market capitalization milestone earlier than expected may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized upon vesting of tranche all remaining associated expense will be recognized immediately see note equity incentive plan ceo performance award to the consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form for further detail regarding the stock based compensation relating to the ceo performance award critical accounting policy and estimate the consolidated financial statement are prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the gaap the preparation of the consolidated financial statement requires to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue cost and expense and related disclosure we base our estimate on historical experience appropriate and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance change in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual result could differ significantly from the estimate made by our management we evaluate our estimate and assumption on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material difference between these estimate and actual result our future financial statement presentation financial condition result of operation and cash flow will be affected we believe that the following critical accounting policy involve greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policy accordingly these are the policy we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the consolidated financial condition and result of operation revenue recognition adoption of new revenue standard on january we adopted asc revenue from contract with customer new revenue standard using the modified retrospective method the new revenue standard had material impact in our consolidated financial statement for further discussion refer to note summary of significant accounting policy to the consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form automotive segment

control transfer of vehicle and recognized over time on straight line basis we have stand ready obligation to deliver such service to the customer we recognize revenue related to these other feature and service over the performance period which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eight year life of the vehicle revenue related to autopilot and fsd feature is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer for our obligation related to automotive sale we estimate standalone selling price by considering cost used to develop and deliver the service third party pricing of similar option and other information that may be available at the time of revenue recognition we reduce the transaction price and record sale return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product return based on historical experience in addition any fee that are paid or payable by to customer lender when we arrange the financing are recognized an offset against automotive sale revenue cost to obtain contract mainly relate to commission paid to our sale personnel for the sale of vehicle commission are not paid on other obligation

automotive sale with resale value guarantee are consistent with automotive sale without resale value guarantee with the exception of our estimate for sale return reserve sale return reserve for automotive sale with resale value guarantee are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market value on quarterly basis we ass the estimated market value of vehicle under our buyback option program to determine whether there have been change to the likelihood of future product return we accumulate more data related to the buyback value of our vehicle or

control transfer which is when we install solar energy system and the system pass inspection by the utility or the authority jurisdiction revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably stand ready obligation over the warranty period of the solar energy system sale of energy storage system to residential and small scale commercial customer consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfer which is when the product ha been delivered or if we are performing installation when installed and commissioned payment for such storage system is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment term customary to the business for large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sale which consist of the engineering design and installation of the system customer make milestone payment that are consistent with contract specific phase of project revenue from such contract is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred percentage of total estimated contract cost for energy storage system sale and percentage of total estimated labor hour for solar energy system sale certain large scale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sale also include operation and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contract and are thus considered to be combined contract with the design and installation service for certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system where the percentage of completion method doe not apply revenue is recognized when control transfer which is when the product ha been delivered to the customer and commissioned for energy storage system and when the project ha received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy system operation and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term for solar energy system sale and upon delivery of the service for energy storage system sale customer payment for such service are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance in instance where there are multiple performance obligation in single contract we allocate the consideration to the various obligation in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method standalone selling price are estimated based on estimated cost plus margin or using market data for comparable product cost incurred on the sale of residential installation before the solar energy system are completed are included work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheet however any fee that are paid or payable by to solar loan lender would be recognized an offset against revenue cost to obtain contract relate mainly to commission paid to our sale personnel related to the sale of solar energy system and energy storage system our contract cost related to solar energy system and energy storage system sale are typically fulfilled within one year the cost to obtain contract are expensed incurred part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contract we may provide the customer with performance guarantee that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or retention requirement specified in the contract in certain instance we may receive bonus payment if the system performs above specified level conversely if solar energy system or energy storage system doe not meet the performance guarantee requirement we may be required to pay liquidated damage other form of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contract include variable customer payment that will be made based on our energy market participation activity such guarantee and variable customer payment represent form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period additional performance data becomes available such estimate are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable significant reversal of revenue will not occur we record deferred revenue any non refundable amount that are collected from customer related to fee charged for prepayment and remote monitoring service and operation and maintenance service which is recognized revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term energy generation and storage leasing for revenue arrangement where we are the lessor under operating lease agreement for energy generation and storage product we record lease revenue from minimum lease payment including upfront rebate and incentive earned from such system on straight line basis over the life of the lease term assuming all other revenue recognition criterion have been met the difference between the payment received and the revenue recognized is recorded deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet for solar energy system where customer purchase electricity from under ppas prior to january we have determined that these agreement should be accounted for operating lease pursuant to asc revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rate specified under the contract assuming all other revenue recognition criterion are met we record deferred revenue any amount that are collected from customer including lease prepayment in excess of revenue recognized and operation and maintenance service which is recognized revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebate and incentive received from utility company and various local and state government agency which is recognized revenue over the lease term we capitalize initial direct cost from the execution of agreement for solar energy system and ppas which include the referral fee and sale commission an element of solar energy system net and subsequently amortize these cost over the term of the related agreement inventory valuation inventory are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is computed using standard cost for vehicle and energy storage product which approximates actual cost on first in first out basis in addition cost for solar energy system is recorded using actual cost we record inventory write down for excess or obsolete inventory based upon assumption about current and future demand forecast if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amount are written off we also review our inventory to determine whether it carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicle le the estimated cost to convert the inventory on hand into finished product once inventory is written down new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent change in fact and circumstance do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis should our estimate of future selling price or production cost change additional and potentially material increase to this reserve may be required small change in our estimate may result in material charge to our reported financial result warranty we provide manufacturer warranty on all new and used vehicle and production powertrain component and system we sell in addition we also provide warranty on the installation and component of the energy generation and storage system we sell for period typically between to year we accrue warranty reserve for the product sold by which includes our best estimate of the projected cost to repair or replace item under warranty and recall when identified these estimate are based on actual claim incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and cost of future claim these estimate are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sale and change to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material change to the warranty reserve in the future the warranty reserve doe not include projected warranty cost associated with our vehicle subject to lease accounting and our solar energy system under lease contract or ppas the cost to repair these warranty claim are expensed incurred the portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next month is included within accrued liability and other while the remaining balance is included within other long term liability on the consolidated balance sheet warranty expense is recorded component of cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operation stock based compensation we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock option and restricted stock unit rsus granted to employee and our employee stock purchase plan the espp to measure the cost of employee service received in exchange for the stock based award the fair value of stock option award with only service and or performance condition and espp is estimated on the grant or offering date using the black scholes option pricing model the black scholes option pricing model requires input such the risk free interest rate expected term and expected volatility these input are subjective and generally require significant judgment the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period which is generally four year for stock option and rsus and six month for the espp stock based compensation expense is recognized on straight line basis net of actual forfeiture in the period for performance based award stock based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestone when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable for performance based award with vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market condition stock based compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and ii the expected achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being met if such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date we will recognize cumulative catch up expense from the grant date to that point in time if the related market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than it expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone then the stock based compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized if additional operational milestone become probable stock based compensation expense will be recorded in the period it becomes probable including cumulative catch up expense for the service provided since the grant date the fair value of such award is estimated on the grant date using monte carlo simulation we accumulate additional employee stock based award data over time and we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatility and expected life which could materially impact the valuation of our stock based award and the stock based compensation expense that we will recognize in future period stock based compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenue research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operation income tax we are subject to federal and state tax in the and in many foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income tax our deferred tax asset and liability and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax asset we make these estimate and judgment about our future taxable income that are based on assumption that are consistent with our future plan tax law regulation and administrative practice may be subject to change due to economic or political condition including fundamental change to the tax law applicable to corporate multinationals the many country in the european union and number of other country are actively considering change in this regard of december we had recorded full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset because we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax asset will not be realized in the foreseeable future should the actual amount differ from our estimate the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax position in the ordinary course of business there are many transaction and calculation for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attribute based on our estimate of the eventual outcome these effect are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return position are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those position may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authority we are required to file income tax return in the and various foreign jurisdiction which requires to interpret the applicable tax law and regulation in effect in such jurisdiction such return are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authority who may disagree with respect to our tax position we believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit year based on our assessment of many factor including past experience and interpretation of tax law we review and update our estimate in light of changing fact and circumstance such the closing of tax audit the lapse of statute of limitation or change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matter differs from our expectation such difference may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax asset in the period that such determination is made principle of consolidation the consolidated financial statement reflect our account and operation and those of our subsidiary in which we have controlling financial interest in accordance with the provision of asc consolidation we consolidate any variable interest entity vie of which we are the primary beneficiary we form vies with our financing fund investor in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attribute associated with our solar energy system and lease under our direct vehicle leasing program the typical condition for controlling financial interest ownership is holding majority of the voting interest of an entity however controlling financial interest may also exist in entity such vies through arrangement that do not involve controlling voting interest asc requires variable interest holder to consolidate vie if that party ha the power to direct the activity of the vie that most significantly impact the vie economic performance and the obligation to absorb loss of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefit from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie we do not consolidate vie in which we have majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the vies we evaluate our relationship with all the vies on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary all intercompany transaction and balance have been eliminated upon consolidation noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest represent third party interest in the net asset under certain funding arrangement or fund that we enter into to finance the cost of solar energy system and vehicle under operating lease we have determined that the contractual provision of the fund represent substantive profit sharing arrangement we have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balance that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangement is balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value hlbv method we therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest in the net asset of the fund at each balance sheet date using the hlbv method which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet noncontrolling interest in subsidiary and redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiary under the hlbv method the amount reported noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amount the third party would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provision of the fund assuming the net asset of the fund were liquidated at their recorded amount determined in accordance with gaap and with tax law effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third party the third party interest in the result of operation of the fund are determined the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balance in the consolidated balance sheet between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transaction between the fund and the third party however the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third party have the right to redeem their interest in the fund for cash or other asset result of operation revenue year ended december change change dollar in million automotive sale automotive leasing total automotive revenue service and other total automotive

service and other revenue consists of non warranty after sale vehicle service sale of used vehicle retail merchandise sale by our acquired subsidiary to third party customer and vehicle insurance revenue compared to automotive sale revenue increased billion or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december primarily due to an increase of model cash delivery from production scaling and an increase of million in sale of regulatory credit to million the increase wa partially offset by decrease of model and model cash delivery the delivery in the year ended december were at lower average selling price than the prior year due to price adjustment we made to our vehicle offering and the introduction of lower end model trim in due to the price adjustment we estimated that there is greater likelihood that customer will exercise their buyback option that were provided prior to such adjustment result along with the estimated variable consideration related to normal future product return for vehicle sold under the buyback option program we adjusted our sale return reserve on vehicle previously sold under our buyback option program resulting in reduction of automotive sale revenue of million refer to note summary of significant accounting policy to the consolidated statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form automotive leasing revenue decreased million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december the decrease wa primarily due to decrease in cumulative vehicle under our resale value guarantee leasing program which are accounted for operating lease the decrease wa partially offset by an increase in cumulative vehicle under our direct vehicle leasing program partially due to the introduction of model direct leasing in the second quarter of service and other revenue increased million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december the increase wa primarily due to an increase in used vehicle sale from an increased volume of trade in vehicle partially offset by lower average selling price for traded in tesla vehicle due to price adjustment we made to our vehicle offering in additionally there wa an increase in non warranty maintenance service revenue our fleet continues to grow energy generation and storage segment energy generation and storage revenue includes sale and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage product service related to such product and sale of solar energy system incentive compared to energy generation and storage revenue decreased by million or in the

for retail merchandise and cost to provide vehicle insurance cost of service and other revenue also includes direct part material and labor cost manufacturing overhead associated with the sale by our acquired subsidiary to third party customer compared to cost of automotive sale revenue increased billion or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december primarily due to an increase of model cash delivery and higher average model and model cost per unit compared to the prior year due to the discontinuation of lower end trim in the increase were partially offset by decrease of model and model cash delivery and decrease in average model cost per unit compared to the prior year primarily due to lower end trim introduced in and temporary under utilization of manufacturing capacity at lower production volume in the first half of additionally due to price adjustment we made to our vehicle offering in we estimated that there is greater likelihood that customer will exercise their buyback option that were provided prior to such adjustment if customer elect to exercise the buyback option we expect to be able to subsequently resell the returned vehicle which resulted in reduction of automotive cost of sale of million for the year ended december refer to note summary of significant accounting policy to the consolidated statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form cost of automotive leasing revenue decreased million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december the decrease wa primarily due to decrease in cumulative vehicle under our resale value guarantee leasing program which are accounted for operating lease the decrease wa partially offset by an increase in cumulative vehicle under our direct vehicle leasing program partially due to the introduction of model leasing in the second quarter of cost of service and other revenue increased million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended

service personnel in existing and new service center mobile service capability part distribution center and investment in new body shop to provide maintenance service to our rapidly growing fleet of vehicle gross margin for total automotive decreased from to in the year ended december compared to the year ended december primarily due to lower model and model margin from lower selling price due to price adjustment we made to our vehicle offering in higher proportion of model percentage of our total automotive sale compared to the prior period additionally the price adjustment also resulted in reduction in gross automotive sale profit of million from the adjustment of our sale return reserve on vehicle previously sold under our buyback option program the decrease wa partially offset by improvement of model margin compared to the prior year we achieved additional manufacturing efficiency in the production of model and an increase of million in sale of regulatory credit gross margin for total automotive service and other segment decreased from to in the year ended december compared to the year ended december primarily due to the automotive gross margin impact discussed above and higher proportion of service and other within the segment which operates at lower gross margin than our automotive business energy generation and storage segment cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor cost warehouse rent freight warranty expense other overhead cost and amortization of certain acquired intangible asset in addition where arrangement are accounted for operating lease the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy system maintenance cost associated with those system and amortization of any initial direct cost compared to cost of energy generation and storage revenue decreased by million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december the decrease wa primarily due to decrease in deployment of solar cash and loan job partially offset by increase in deployment of powerwall powerpack and megapack gross margin for energy generation and storage remained relatively consistent at in the year ended december compared to the year ended december energy storage gross margin improved in the current year result of lower material cost partially offset by lower gross margin in our cash and loan solar business driven by higher cost from temporary manufacturing under utilization of our solar roof ramp research and development expense year ended

in the fourth quarter of additionally the expense period wa shorter in the prior year it commenced upon the grant approval date of march restructuring and other year ended december change change dollar in million restructuring and other percentage of revenue during the year ended december we carried out certain restructuring action in order to reduce cost and improve efficiency result we recognized million of cost primarily related to employee termination expense and loss from closing certain store impacting both segment we recognized million in impairment related to the ipr intangible asset we abandoned further development effort refer to note goodwill and intangible asset for detail and million for the related equipment within the energy generation and storage segment we also incurred loss of million for closing operation in certain facility on the statement of cash flow the amount were presented in the caption in which such amount would have been recorded absent the impairment charge the employee termination expense were substantially paid by december while the remaining amount were non cash during the year ended december we carried out certain restructuring action in order to reduce cost and improve efficiency and recognized million of employee termination expense and estimated loss from sub leasing certain facility the employee termination cash expense of million were substantially paid by the end of while the remaining amount were non cash also included within restructuring and other activity wa million of expense materially all of which were non cash from restructuring the energy generation and storage segment which comprised of disposal of certain tangible asset the shortening of the useful life of trade name intangible asset and contract termination penalty in addition we concluded that small portion of the ipr asset is not commercially feasible consequently we recognized an impairment loss of million we recognized settlement and

interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest wa related to financing fund arrangement net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest changed unfavorably by million in the year ended december compared to the year ended december the change wa primarily due to lower activity in our financing fund arrangement liquidity and capital resource of december we had billion of cash and cash equivalent balance held in foreign currency had dollar equivalent of billion and consisted primarily of chinese yuan euro and canadian dollar our source of cash are predominantly from our delivery of vehicle sale and installation of our energy storage product and solar energy system proceeds from debt facility proceeds from financing fund and proceeds from equity offering our source of liquidity and cash flow enable to fund ongoing operation research and development project for new product establishment and or increase of model and model production capacity at the fremont factory and at gigafactory shanghai the continued expansion of gigafactory nevada the construction of gigafactory berlin the manufacturing ramp of the solar roof at gigafactory new york and the continued expansion of our retail and service location body shop mobile service fleet and supercharger network discussed in and subject to the consideration referenced in part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation management opportunity challenge and risk and outlook trend in cash flow capital expenditure and operating expense in this annual report on form considering the expected pace of the manufacturing ramp for our product construction and expansion of our factory and pipeline of project under development and consistent with our current strategy of using partner to manufacture battery cell well considering all other infrastructure growth we currently expect our average annual capital expenditure in and the two succeeding fiscal year to be billion to billion we expect that the cash we generate from our core operation will generally be sufficient to cover our future capital expenditure and to pay down our near term debt obligation although we may choose to seek alternative financing source for example we expect that much of our investment in gigafactory shanghai will continue to be funded through indebtedness arranged through local financial institution in china such the rmb billion or the equivalent amount in dollar fixed asset term facility and rmb billion or the equivalent amount in dollar working capital revolving facility that our local subsidiary entered into in december and we expect the same with respect to gigafactory berlin always we continually evaluate our capital expenditure need and may decide it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business to further strengthen our balance sheet or for general corporate purpose we have an agreement to spend or incur billion in combined capital operational expense cost of good sold and other cost in the state of new york during the year period following full production at gigafactory new york we anticipate meeting these obligation through our operation at this facility and other operation within the state of new york and we do not believe that we face significant risk of default we expect that our current source of liquidity together with our projection of cash flow from operating activity will provide with adequate liquidity over at least the next month large portion of our future expenditure is to fund our growth and we can adjust our capital and operating expenditure by operating segment including future expansion of our product offering retail and service location body shop mobile service fleet and supercharger network we may need or want to raise additional fund in the future and these fund may not be available to when we need or want them or at all if we can not raise additional fund when we need or want them our operation and prospect could be negatively affected in addition we had billion of unused committed amount under our credit facility and financing fund of december some of which are subject to satisfying specified condition prior to draw down such pledging to our lender sufficient amount of qualified receivables inventory leased vehicle and our interest in those lease solar energy system and the associated customer contract our interest in financing fund or various other asset and contributing or selling qualified solar energy system and the

business in area such research and development and selling general and administrative and working capital especially inventory which includes vehicle in transit our operating cash inflow include cash from vehicle sale customer lease payment customer deposit cash from sale of regulatory credit and energy generation and storage product these cash inflow are offset by our payment to supplier for production material and part used in our manufacturing process operating expense operating lease payment and interest payment on our financing net cash provided by operating activity increased by million to billion during the year ended december from billion during the year ended december this favorable change wa primarily due to the increase in net income excluding non cash expense and gain of million partially offset by the increase in net operating asset and liability of million and million of the repayment of our convertible senior note due in which wa classified an operating activity this represented an interest payment on the discounted convertible note the increase in net operating asset and liability wa mainly driven by smaller increase in account payable and accrued liability in compared to we were ramping for model production in and larger increase in operating lease vehicle in compared to we began offering model leasing in the increase in net operating asset and liability wa partially offset by smaller increase in inventory and larger increase in deferred revenue in compared to cash flow from investing activity cash flow from investing activity and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditure which were billion during mainly for gigafactory shanghai construction model production and model preparation and billion during mainly for model production design acquisition and installation of solar energy system amounted to million and million for the year ended december and respectively cash flow from financing activity cash flow from financing activity during the year ended december consisted primarily of billion from the issuance of the convertible senior note due in note net of transaction cost and million from

of the engineering design and installation of the system customer make milestone payment that are consistent with contract specific phase of project revenue from such contract is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred percentage of total estimated contract cost for energy storage system sale and percentage of total estimated labor hour for solar energy system sale certain large scale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sale also include operation and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contract and are thus considered to be combined contract with the design and installation service for certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system where the percentage of completion method doe not apply revenue is recognized when control transfer which is when the product ha been delivered to the customer and commissioned for energy storage system and when the project ha received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy system operation and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term for solar energy system sale and upon delivery of the service for energy storage system sale customer payment for such service are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance in instance where there are multiple performance obligation in single contract we allocate the consideration to the various obligation in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method standalone selling price are estimated based on estimated cost plus margin or using market data for comparable product cost incurred on the sale of residential installation before the solar energy system are completed are included work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheet however any fee that are paid or payable by to solar loan lender would be recognized an offset against revenue cost to obtain contract relate mainly to commission paid to our sale personnel related to the sale of solar energy system and energy storage system our contract cost related to solar energy system and energy storage system sale are typically fulfilled within one year the cost to obtain contract are expensed incurred part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contract we may provide the customer with performance guarantee that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or retention requirement specified in the contract in certain instance we may receive bonus payment if the system performs above specified level conversely if solar energy system or energy storage system doe not meet the performance guarantee requirement we may be required to pay liquidated damage other form of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contract include variable customer payment that will be made based on our energy market participation activity such guarantee and variable customer payment represent form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period additional performance data becomes available such estimate are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable significant reversal of revenue will not occur we record deferred revenue any non refundable amount that are collected from customer related to fee charged for prepayment and remote monitoring service and operation and maintenance service which is recognized revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term of december and deferred revenue related to such customer payment amounted to million and million respectively revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance of december wa million for the year ended december revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance of january wa million for the year ended december we have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligation for energy generation and storage sale with an original expected contract length of one year or le and the amount that we have the right to invoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value of the performance to date of december total transaction price allocated to performance obligation that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contract with an original expected length of more than one year wa million of this amount we expect to recognize million in the next month and the remaining over period up to year energy generation and storage leasing for revenue arrangement where we are the lessor under operating lease agreement for energy generation and storage product we record lease revenue from minimum lease payment including upfront rebate and incentive earned from such system on straight line basis over the life of the lease term assuming all other revenue recognition criterion have been met the difference between the payment received and the revenue recognized is recorded deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet for solar energy system where customer purchase electricity from under ppas prior to january we have determined that these agreement should be accounted for operating lease pursuant to asc revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rate specified under the contract assuming all other revenue recognition criterion are met we record deferred revenue any amount that are collected from customer including lease prepayment in excess of revenue recognized and operation and maintenance service which is recognized revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term of december and deferred revenue related to such customer payment amounted to million and million respectively deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebate and incentive received from utility company and various local and state government agency which is recognized revenue over the lease term of december and december deferred revenue from rebate and incentive amounted to million and million respectively we capitalize initial direct cost from the execution of agreement for solar energy system and ppas which include the referral fee and sale commission an element of solar energy system net and subsequently amortize these cost over the term of the related agreement revenue by source the following table disaggregates our revenue by major source in million year ended december automotive sale without resale value guarantee automotive sale with resale value guarantee automotive regulatory credit energy generation and storage sale service and other total revenue from sale and service automotive leasing energy generation and storage leasing total revenue we made pricing adjustment to our vehicle offering in which resulted in reduction of automotive sale with resale value guarantee revenue refer to automotive sale with resale value guarantee section above for detail the amount presented represents automotive sale with resale value guarantee in year ended december net of such pricing adjustment impact under asc lease solar energy system sale and ppas that commence after january where we are the lessor and were previously accounted for lease no longer meet the definition of lease and are instead accounted for in accordance with the new revenue standard refer to the lease section below for detail cost of revenue automotive segment automotive sale cost of automotive sale revenue includes direct part material and labor cost manufacturing overhead including depreciation cost of tooling and machinery shipping and logistic cost vehicle connectivity cost allocation of electricity and infrastructure cost related to our supercharger network and reserve for estimated warranty expense cost of automotive sale revenue also includes adjustment to warranty expense and charge to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds it estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand automotive leasing cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of operating lease vehicle over the lease term well warranty expense recognized incurred cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity cost and allocation of electricity and infrastructure cost related to our supercharger network for vehicle under our leasing program service and other cost of service and other revenue includes cost associated with providing non warranty after sale service cost to acquire and certify used vehicle cost for retail merchandise and cost to provide vehicle insurance cost of service and other revenue also includes direct part material and labor cost manufacturing overhead associated with the sale by our acquired subsidiary to third party customer energy generation and storage segment energy generation and storage energy generation and storage cost of revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor cost warehouse rent freight warranty expense other overhead cost and amortization of certain acquired intangible asset in addition where arrangement are accounted for operating lease the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy system maintenance cost associated with those system and amortization of any initial direct cost lease in february the fasb issued asu no asc lease to require lessee to recognize all lease with certain exception on the balance sheet while recognition on the statement of operation will remain similar to lease accounting under asc subsequently the fasb issued asu no codification improvement to topic lease asu no targeted improvement asu no narrow scope improvement for lessor and asu codification improvement to clarify and amend the guidance in asu no asc eliminates real estate specific provision and modifies certain aspect of lessor accounting we adopted asc of january using the cumulative effect adjustment approach adoption of the new lease standard in addition we elected the package of practical expedient permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard which allowed to carry forward the historical determination of contract lease lease classification and not reassess initial direct cost for historical lease arrangement accordingly previously reported financial statement including footnote disclosure have not been recast to reflect the application of the new standard to all comparative period presented the finance lease classification under asc includes lease previously classified capital lease under asc agreement for solar energy system lease and ppas solar lease that commence after january where we are the lessor and were previously accounted for operating lease no longer meet the definition of lease upon the adoption of asc and are instead accounted for in accordance with the revenue standard under these two type of arrangement the customer is not responsible for the design of the energy system but rather approved the energy system benefit in term of energy capacity and production to be received over the term accordingly the revenue from solar lease commencing after january are now recognized earned based on the amount of capacity provided or electricity delivered at the contractual billing rate assuming all other revenue recognition criterion have been met under the practical expedient available under asc we recognize revenue based on the value of the service which is consistent with the billing amount we have lease agreement with lease and non lease component and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to account for lease and non lease component together single combined lease component from both lessee and lessor perspective from lessor perspective the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non lease component and associated lease component and the lease component if accounted for separately would be classified an operating lease additionally lease previously identified build to suit leasing arrangement under legacy lease accounting asc were derecognized pursuant to the transition guidance provided for build to suit lease in asc accordingly these lease have been reassessed operating lease of the adoption date under asc and are included on the consolidated balance sheet of december operating lease asset are included within operating lease right of use asset and the corresponding operating lease liability are included within accrued liability and other for the current portion and within other long term liability for the long term portion on our consolidated balance sheet of december finance lease asset are included within property plant and equipment net and the corresponding finance lease liability are included within current portion of long term debt and finance lease for the current portion and within long term debt and finance lease net of current portion for the long term portion on our consolidated balance sheet of december we have elected not to present short term lease on the consolidated balance sheet these lease have lease term of month or le at lease inception and do not contain purchase option or renewal term that we are reasonably certain to exercise all other lease asset and lease liability are recognized based on the present value of lease payment over the lease term at commencement date because most of our lease do not provide an implicit rate of return we used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at adoption date in determining the present value of lease payment adoption of the new lease standard on january had material impact on our consolidated financial statement the most significant impact related to the recognition of right of use rou asset of billion and lease liability of billion for operating lease on the consolidated balance sheet and ii de recognition of build to suit lease asset and liability of billion and billion respectively with the net impact of million recorded to accumulated deficit of january we also reclassified prepaid expense and other current asset balance of million and deferred rent balance including tenant improvement allowance and other liability balance of million relating to our existing lease arrangement of december into the rou asset balance of january rou asset represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liability represent our obligation to make lease payment arising from the lease the standard did not materially impact our consolidated statement of operation and consolidated statement of cash flow the cumulative effect of the change made to our consolidated balance sheet of january for the adoption of the new lease standard wa follows in million balance at december adjustment from adoption of new lease standard balance at january asset prepaid expense and other current asset property plant and equipment net operating lease right of use asset other asset liability accrued liability and other current portion of long term debt and finance lease long term debt and finance lease net of current portion other long term liability equity accumulated deficit research and development cost research and development cost are expensed incurred marketing promotional and advertising cost marketing promotional and advertising cost are expensed incurred and are included an element of selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operation we incurred marketing promotional and advertising cost of million million and million in the year ended december and respectively of which the majority is related to promotional activity income tax income tax are computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax asset and liability are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax base of asset and liability using enacted tax rate in effect for the year in which the difference are expected to affect taxable income valuation allowance are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax asset to the amount expected to be realized we record liability related to uncertain tax position when despite our belief that our tax return position are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those position may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authority accrued interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit are classified income tax expense comprehensive income loss comprehensive income loss is comprised of net income loss and other comprehensive income loss other comprehensive income loss consists of unrealized gain and loss on cash flow hedge and foreign currency translation adjustment that have been excluded from the determination of net income loss stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for cost related to all share based payment including stock option restricted stock unit rsus and our employee stock purchase plan the espp the fair value of stock option award with only service and or performance condition and the espp is estimated on the grant or offering date using the black scholes option pricing model the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock stock based compensation expense is recognized on straight line basis over the requisite service period net of actual forfeiture in the period for performance based award stock based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestone when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable for performance based award with vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market condition stock based compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and ii the expected achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being met if such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date we will recognize cumulative catch up expense from the grant date to that point in time if the related market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than it expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone then the stock based compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized the fair value of such award is estimated on the grant date using monte carlo simulation see note equity incentive plan we accumulate additional employee stock based award data over time and we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatility and expected life which could materially impact the valuation of our stock based award and the stock based compensation expense that we will recognize in future period stock based compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenue research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operation noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest represent third party interest in the net asset under certain funding arrangement or fund that we enter into to finance the cost of solar energy system and vehicle under operating lease we have determined that the contractual provision of the fund represent substantive profit sharing arrangement we have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balance that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangement is balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value hlbv method we therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest in the net asset of the fund at each balance sheet date using the hlbv method which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet noncontrolling interest in subsidiary and redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiary under the hlbv method the amount reported noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amount the third party would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provision of the fund assuming the net asset of the fund were liquidated at their recorded amount determined in accordance with gaap and with tax law effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third party the third party interest in the result of operation of the fund are determined the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balance in the consolidated balance sheet between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transaction between the fund and the third party however the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third party have the right to redeem their interest in the fund for cash or other asset net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholder basic net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholder is calculated by dividing net income loss attributable to common stockholder by the weighted average share of common stock outstanding for the period during the year ended december we increased net loss attributable to common stockholder by million to arrive at the numerator used to calculate net loss per share this adjustment represents the difference between the cash we paid to financing fund investor for their noncontrolling interest in one of our subsidiary and the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest on our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with asc earnings per share potentially dilutive share which are based on the weighted average share of common stock underlying outstanding stock based award warrant and convertible senior note using the treasury stock method or the if converted method applicable are included when calculating diluted net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholder when their effect is dilutive since we intend to settle or have settled in cash the principal outstanding under our convertible senior note due in convertible senior note due in convertible senior note due in convertible senior note due in and convertible senior note due in assumed in our maxwell technology inc acquisition we use the treasury stock method when calculating their potential dilutive effect if any furthermore in connection with the offering of our note we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant see note debt however our convertible note hedge are not included when calculating potentially dilutive share since their effect is always anti dilutive warrant which have strike price above our share price were out of the money and have not been included in the table below the following table present the potentially dilutive share that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholder because their effect wa anti dilutive in million year ended december stock based award convertible senior note warrant business combination we account for business acquisition under asc business combination the total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured the fair value of the asset given equity instrument issued and liability assumed at the acquisition date cost that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed incurred identifiable asset including intangible asset liability assumed including contingent liability and noncontrolling interest in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date we recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interest is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable asset acquired and the liability assumed we recognize bargain purchase gain within other income expense net on the consolidated statement of operation if the net fair value of the identifiable asset acquired and the liability assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interest we include the result of operation of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statement beginning on the acquisition date cash and cash equivalent all highly liquid investment with an original maturity of three month or le at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalent our cash equivalent are primarily comprised of money market fund restricted cash we maintain certain cash balance restricted to withdrawal or use our restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash collateral for our sale to lease partner with resale value guarantee letter of credit real estate lease insurance policy credit card borrowing facility and certain operating lease in addition restricted cash includes cash received from certain fund investor that have not been released for use by and cash held to service certain payment under various secured debt facility the following table total cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash reported on the consolidated balance sheet the sum are presented in the consolidated statement of cash flow in million december december december december cash and cash equivalent restricted cash current portion restricted cash net of current portion total presented in the consolidated statement of cash flow account receivable and allowance for doubtful account account receivable primarily include amount related to receivables from financial institution and leasing company offering various financing product to our customer sale of energy generation and storage product sale of regulatory credit to other automotive manufacturer and maintenance service on vehicle owned by leasing company we provide an allowance against account receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected we write off account receivable when they are deemed uncollectible we typically do not carry significant account receivable related to our vehicle and related sale customer payment are due prior to vehicle delivery except for amount due from commercial financial institution for approved financing arrangement between our customer and the financial institution mypower customer note receivable we have customer note receivable under the legacy mypower loan program mypower wa offered by solarcity to provide residential customer with the option to finance the purchase of solar energy system through year loan the outstanding balance net of any allowance for potentially uncollectible amount are presented on the consolidated balance sheet component of prepaid expense and other current asset for the current portion and mypower customer note receivable net of current portion for the long term portion in determining the allowance and credit quality for customer note receivable we identify significant customer with known dispute or collection issue and also consider our historical level of credit loss and current economic trend that might impact the level of future credit loss customer note receivable that are individually impaired are charged off write off of the allowance for loss since acquisition there have been no new significant customer with known dispute or collection issue and the amount of potentially uncollectible amount ha been insignificant in addition there were no material non accrual or past due customer note receivable of december concentration of risk credit risk financial instrument that potentially subject to concentration of credit risk consist of cash cash equivalent restricted cash account receivable convertible note hedge and interest rate swap our cash balance are primarily invested in money market fund or on deposit at high credit quality financial institution in the these deposit are typically in excess of insured limit of december and no entity represented or more of our total account receivable balance the risk of concentration for our interest rate swap is mitigated by transacting with several highly rated multinational bank supply risk we are dependent on our supplier the majority of which are single source supplier and the inability of these supplier to deliver necessary component of our product in timely manner at price quality level and volume acceptable to or our inability to efficiently manage these component from these supplier could have material adverse effect on our business prospect financial condition and operating result inventory valuation inventory are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is computed using standard cost for vehicle and energy storage product which approximates actual cost on first in first out basis in addition cost for solar energy system is recorded using actual cost we record inventory write down for excess or obsolete inventory based upon assumption about current and future demand forecast if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amount are written off we also review our inventory to determine whether it carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicle le the estimated cost to convert the inventory on hand into finished product once inventory is written down new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent change in fact and circumstance do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis should our estimate of future selling price or production cost change additional and potentially material increase to this reserve may be required small change in our estimate may result in material charge to our reported financial result operating lease vehicle vehicle that are leased part of our direct vehicle leasing program vehicle delivered to leasing partner with resale value guarantee and buyback option and vehicle delivered to customer with resale value guarantee where exercise is probable are classified operating lease vehicle the related revenue transaction are treated operating lease under asc refer to the automotive leasing revenue section above for detail operating lease vehicle are recorded at cost le accumulated depreciation we generally depreciate their value le salvage value using the straight line method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the contractual period the total cost of operating lease vehicle recorded on the consolidated balance sheet of december and wa billion and billion respectively accumulated depreciation related to leased vehicle of december and wa million and million respectively solar energy system net we are the lessor of solar energy system prior to january these lease were accounted for operating lease in accordance with asc under asc to determine lease classification we evaluated the lease term to determine whether there wa transfer of ownership or bargain purchase option at the end of the lease whether the lease term wa greater than of the useful life or whether the present value of the minimum lease payment exceeded of the fair value at lease inception discussed in the lease section above agreement for solar energy system lease and ppas that commence after january no longer meet the definition of lease upon the adoption of asc and are instead accounted for in accordance with the new revenue standard we utilize periodic appraisal to estimate useful life and fair value at lease inception and residual value at lease termination solar energy system are stated at cost le accumulated depreciation depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the respective asset follows solar energy system in service to year initial direct cost related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition cost lease term up to year solar energy system pending interconnection will be depreciated solar energy system in service when they have been interconnected and placed in service solar energy system under construction represents system that are under installation which will be depreciated solar energy system in service when they are completed interconnected and placed in service initial direct cost related to customer solar energy system agreement acquisition cost are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer agreement property plant and equipment net property plant and equipment net including leasehold improvement are recognized at cost le accumulated depreciation depreciation is generally computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the respective asset follows machinery equipment vehicle and office furniture to year building and building improvement to year computer equipment and software to year leasehold improvement are depreciated on straight line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the term of the related lease upon the retirement or sale of our property plant and equipment the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operation maintenance and repair expenditure are expensed incurred while major improvement that increase the functionality output or expected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified useful life interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant capital asset construction capitalized interest on construction in progress is included within property plant and equipment and is amortized over the life of the related asset prior to the adoption of the new lease standard we were deemed to be the owner for accounting purpose during the construction phase of certain long lived asset under build to suit lease arrangement because of our involvement with the construction our exposure to any potential cost overrun or our other commitment under the arrangement in accordance with asc we recognized build to suit lease asset under construction and corresponding build to suit lease liability on the consolidated balance sheet once construction wa completed if lease met certain sale leaseback criterion we removed the asset and liability and accounted for the lease an operating lease otherwise the lease wa accounted for capital lease result of the adoption of the new lease standard on january we have de recognized all build to suit lease asset and have reassessed these lease to be operating lease right of use asset within the consolidated balance sheet of december refer to lease section above for detail long lived asset including acquired intangible asset we review our property plant and equipment long term prepayment and intangible asset for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable we measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flow that the asset is expected to generate if the asset is not recoverable it carrying amount would be adjusted down to it fair value for the year ended december and we have recognized certain impairment of our long lived asset refer to note goodwill and intangible asset and note restructuring and other for further detail for the year ended december we have recognized no material impairment of our long lived asset intangible asset with definite life are amortized on straight line basis over their estimated useful life which range from one to thirty year goodwill we ass goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if event or change in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired by comparing it carrying value to the reporting unit fair value for the year ended december and we had not recognized any impairment of goodwill capitalization of software cost for cost incurred in development of internal use software we capitalize cost incurred during the application development stage cost related to preliminary project activity and post implementation activity are expensed incurred internal use software is amortized on straight line basis over it estimated useful life of three to ten year we evaluate the useful life of these asset on an annual basis and we test for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance occur that could impact the recoverability of these asset foreign currency we determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiary and their operating division based on the primary currency in which they operate in case where the functional currency is not the dollar we recognize cumulative translation adjustment created by the different rate we apply to accumulated deficit including current period income or loss and the balance sheet for each subsidiary we apply the monthly average functional exchange rate to it monthly income or loss and the month end functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet foreign currency transaction gain and loss are result of the effect of exchange rate change on transaction denominated in currency other than the functional currency transaction gain and loss are recognized in other income expense net in the consolidated statement of operation for the year ended december and we recorded foreign currency transaction gain of million gain of million and loss of million respectively warranty we provide manufacturer warranty on all new and used vehicle and production powertrain component and system we sell in addition we also provide warranty on the installation and component of the energy generation and storage system we sell for period typically between to year we accrue warranty reserve for the product sold by which includes our best estimate of the projected cost to repair or replace item under warranty and recall when identified these estimate are based on actual claim incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and cost of future claim these estimate are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sale and change to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material change to the warranty reserve in the future the warranty reserve doe not include projected warranty cost associated with our vehicle subject to lease accounting and our solar energy system under lease contract or ppas the cost to repair these warranty claim are expensed incurred the portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next month is included within accrued liability and other while the remaining balance is included within other long term liability on the consolidated balance sheet warranty expense is recorded component of cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operation due to the magnitude of our automotive business accrued warranty balance of december wa primarily related to our automotive segment accrued warranty activity consisted of the following in million year ended december accrued warranty beginning of period assumed warranty liability from acquisition warranty cost incurred net change in liability for pre existing warranty including expiration and foreign exchange impact additional warranty accrued from adoption of the new revenue standard provision for warranty accrued warranty end of period for the year ended december and and warranty cost incurred for vehicle accounted for operating lease were million million and million respectively solar renewable energy credit we account for solar renewable energy credit srecs when they are purchased by or sold to third party for srecs generated by solar energy system owned by and minted by government agency we do not recognize any specifically identifiable cost there are no specific incremental cost incurred to generate the srecs we recognize revenue within the energy generation and storage segment from the sale of an srec when the srec is transferred to the buyer and the cost of the srec if any is then recorded to energy generation and storage cost of revenue deferred investment tax credit revenue we have solar energy system that are eligible for itcs that accrue to eligible property under the internal revenue code irc under section of the irc and the related regulation lessor of qualifying property may elect to treat the lessee the owner of such property for the purpose of claiming the itcs associated with such property these regulation enable the itcs to be separated from the ownership of the property and allow the transfer of the itcs under our lease pas through fund arrangement we can make tax election to pas through the itcs to the investor who are the legal lessee of the property therefore we are able to monetize these itcs to the investor who can utilize them in return for cash payment we consider the monetization of itcs to constitute one of the key element of realizing the value associated with solar energy system consequently we consider the proceeds from the monetization of itcs to be component of revenue generated from solar energy system under the new revenue standard we recognize revenue upon the delivery of itcs to investor under our lease pas through fund arrangement this is the point in time that control of itcs ha transferred we indemnify the investor for any recapture of itcs due to our non compliance we have concluded that the likelihood of recapture event is remote and consequently we have not recognized liability for this indemnification on the consolidated balance sheet nevada tax incentive we had entered into agreement with the state of nevada and storey county in nevada that provide abatement for sale use real property personal property and employer excise tax discount to the base tariff energy rate and transferable tax credit these incentive are available for the applicable period beginning on october and ending on either june or june depending on the incentive under these agreement we were eligible for maximum of million of transferable tax credit subject to capital investment by and our partner for gigafactory nevada of at least billion which we exceeded during and specified hiring target for gigafactory nevada which we exceeded during we recorded these credit earned when we had evidence there wa market for their sale credit were applied cost offset to either employee expense or to capital asset depending on the source of the credit credit earned from employee hire or capital spending by our partner at gigafactory nevada were recorded reduction to operating expense of december and we had earned the maximum of million of transferable tax credit under these agreement recent accounting pronouncement recently issued accounting pronouncement not yet adopted in june the fasb issued asu no measurement of credit loss on financial instrument to require financial asset carried at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on historical experience current condition and forecast subsequently the fasb issued asu no codification improvement to topic to clarify that receivables arising from operating lease are within the scope of lease accounting standard further the fasb issued asu no asu no asu and asu to provide additional guidance on the credit loss standard the asus are effective for interim and annual period beginning after december with early adoption permitted adoption of the asus is on modified retrospective basis we plan to adopt the asus on january the asus are currently not expected to have material impact on our consolidated financial statement in january the fasb issued asu no simplifying the test for goodwill impairment to simplify the test for goodwill impairment by removing step an entity will therefore perform the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of reporting unit with it carrying amount and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit an entity still ha the option to perform qualitative assessment to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary the asu is effective for interim and annual period beginning after december with early adoption permitted adoption of the asu is prospective we plan to adopt the asu prospectively on january the asu is currently not expected to have material impact on our consolidated financial statement in august the fasb issued asu no customer accounting for implementation cost incurred in cloud computing arrangement that is service contract the asu aligns the requirement for capitalizing implementation cost incurred in hosting arrangement that is service contract with the requirement for capitalizing implementation cost incurred to develop or obtain internal use software and hosting arrangement that include an internal use software license the asu is effective for interim and annual period beginning after december with early adoption permitted adoption of the asu is either retrospective or prospective we plan to adopt the asu prospectively on january the asu is currently not expected to have material impact on our consolidated financial statement in december the fasb issued asu no simplifying the accounting for income tax part of it initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standard the amendment in the asu are effective for fiscal year beginning after december including interim period therein early adoption of the standard is permitted including adoption in interim or annual period for which financial statement have not yet been issued we have not early adopted this asu for the asu is currently not expected to have material impact on our consolidated financial statement recently adopted accounting pronouncement in february the fasb issued asu no lease to require lessee to recognize all lease with limited exception on the balance sheet while recognition on the statement of operation will remain similar to legacy lease accounting asc the asu also eliminates real estate specific provision and modifies certain aspect of lessor accounting subsequently the fasb issued asu no codification improvement to topic asu no targeted improvement asu no narrow scope improvement for lessor and asu codification improvement to clarify and amend the guidance in asu no we adopted the asus on january on modified retrospective basis through cumulative adjustment to our beginning accumulated deficit balance prior comparative period have not been recast under this method and we adopted all available practical expedient applicable further solar lease that commence on or after january where we are the lessor and which were accounted for lease under asc will no

capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than it expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone then the stock based compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized the market capitalization milestone period and the valuation of

on our net deferred tax increased by million decreased by million and increased by million during the year ended december and respectively the change in valuation allowance are primarily due to additional deferred tax asset and liability incurred in the respective year we have net million of deferred tax asset in foreign jurisdiction which management belief are more likely than not to be fully realized given the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdiction we continue to monitor the realizability of the deferred tax asset taking into account multiple factor including the result of operation and magnitude of excess tax deduction for stock based compensation we intend to continue maintaining full valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset until there is sufficient

significantly expire until for federal and for state purpose portion of these loss were generated by solarcity prior to our acquisition in and therefore are subject to change of control provision which limit the amount of acquired tax attribute that can be utilized in given tax year we do not expect these change of control limitation to significantly impact our ability to utilize these attribute of december we had research and development tax credit of million and million for federal and state income tax purpose respectively if not utilized the federal research and development tax credit will expire in various amount beginning in however the state research and development tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely in addition we have other general business tax credit of

loss and tax credit generated to date are subject to adjustment for federal and california income tax purpose tax year to remain subject to examination in other state and foreign jurisdiction the potential outcome of the current examination could result in change to unrecognized tax benefit within the next twelve month however we can not reasonably estimate possible adjustment at this time the tax court issued decision in altera corp commissioner related to the treatment of stock based compensation expense in cost sharing arrangement on june the court reversed the tax court decision and upheld the validity of treas reg section requiring stock based compensation cost be included in the cost shared under cost sharing agreement given that the current active decision can still be appealed because altera ha the option to petition up to the supreme court tesla position is to continue to include stock based compensation in cost sharing allocation agreement if and when the current tax court decision is overturned we will treat the amount previously shared pre payment to future cost sharing agreement cost because we have full valuation allowance in the any potential tax benefit

business result of operation prospect cash flow financial position and brand indemnification and guaranteed return we are contractually obligated to compensate certain fund investor for any loss that they may suffer in certain limited circumstance resulting from reduction in treasury grant or investment tax credit itc generally such obligation would arise result of reduction to the value of the underlying solar energy system assessed by the treasury department for purpose of claiming treasury grant or assessed by the irs for purpose of claiming itcs or treasury grant for each balance sheet date we ass and recognize when applicable distribution payable for the potential exposure from this obligation based on all the information available at that time including any guideline issued by the treasury department on solar energy system valuation for purpose of claiming treasury grant and any audit undertaken by the irs we believe that any payment to the fund investor in excess of the amount already recognized by for this obligation are not probable or material based on the fact known at the filing date the maximum potential future payment that we could have to make under this obligation would depend on the difference between the fair value of the solar energy system sold or transferred to the fund determined by and the value that the treasury department would determine fair value for the system for purpose of claiming treasury grant or the value the irs would determine the fair value for the system for purpose of claiming itcs or treasury grant we claim treasury grant based on guideline provided by the treasury department and the statutory regulation from the irs we use fair value determined with the assistance of independent third party appraisal commissioned by the basis for determining the itcs that are passed through to and claimed by the fund investor since we can not determine future revision to treasury department guideline governing solar energy system value or how the irs will evaluate system value used in claiming itcs or treasury grant we are unable to reliably estimate the maximum potential future payment that it could have to make under this obligation of each balance sheet date we are eligible to receive certain state and local incentive that are associated with renewable energy generation the amount of incentive that can be claimed is based on the projected or actual solar energy system size and or the amount of solar energy produced we also currently participate in one state incentive program that is based on either the fair market value or the tax basis of solar energy system placed in service state and local incentive received are allocated between and fund investor in accordance with the contractual provision of each fund we are not contractually obligated to indemnify any fund investor for any loss they may incur due to shortfall in the amount of state or local incentive actually received our lease pas through financing fund have one time lease payment reset mechanism that occurs after the installation of all solar energy system in fund result of this mechanism we may be required to refund master lease prepayment previously received from investor any refund of master lease prepayment would reduce the lease pas through financing obligation letter of credit of december we had million of unused letter of credit outstanding note variable interest entity arrangement we have entered into various arrangement with investor to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy system and vehicle in particular our wholly owned subsidiary and fund investor have formed and contributed cash and asset into various financing fund and entered into related agreement we have determined that the fund are variable interest entity vies and we are the primary beneficiary of these vies by reference to the power and benefit criterion under asc consolidation we have considered the provision within the agreement which grant the power to manage and make decision that affect the operation of these vies including determining the solar energy system or vehicle and the associated customer contract to be
