disruptive technological change impact the industry in which we operate including development in payment card tokenization mobile social commerce ecommerce through social network authentication virtual currency including distributed ledger technology and nfc and other proximity payment device such contactless payment we can not predict the effect of technological change on our business in addition to our own initiative and innovation we rely in part on third party including some of our competitor for the development of and access to new technology we expect that new service and technology applicable to the industry in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to or render obsolete the technology we currently use in our product and service developing and incorporating new technology into our product and service may require substantial expenditure take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful in addition our ability to adopt new product and service and to develop new technology may be inhibited by industry wide standard payment network change to law and regulation resistance to change from consumer or merchant third party intellectual property right or other factor our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technology and adapt to technological change and evolving industry standard if we are unable to do in timely or cost effective manner our business could be harmed change in consumer fund their paypal transaction could harm our business we pay transaction fee when consumer fund payment transaction using credit card lower fee when consumer fund payment with debit card and nominal fee when consumer fund payment transaction by electronic transfer of fund from bank account or from an existing paypal account balance or through our paypal credit product our financial success is sensitive to change in the rate at which our consumer fund payment using credit and debit card collectively payment card which can significantly increase our cost although we provide consumer with the opportunity to use their existing paypal account balance to fund payment transaction some of our consumer may prefer to use payment card especially if these payment card offer feature and benefit that are not provided part of their paypal account an increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment card or in fee associated with our funding mix or other event or development that make it more difficult of contentsor costly for to fund transaction with lower cost funding option could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business we have entered into strategic partnership with major payment card network and or issuing bank to promote greater consumer choice and make it easier for merchant to accept and consumer to pay with these partner credit and or debt card and to allow to gain access to these partner tokenization service for in store point of sale paypal transaction these arrangement may have an uncertain impact on our business while we anticipate that these and similar strategic partnership we may enter into in the future will result in an increase in the number of transaction and transaction volume that we process we also anticipate that greater percentage of customer transaction will be executed using payment card which would likely increase the transaction cost associated with our funding mix which could adversely affect our business and result of operation our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breach our business involves the collection storage processing and transmission of customer personal data including financial information and information about how they interact with our payment platform in addition significant number of our customer authorize to bill their payment card or bank account directly for all transaction and other fee charged by we have built our reputation on the premise that our payment platform offer customer more secure way to make payment an increasing number of organization including large merchant and business other large

vendor or other user of our system into disclosing user name password payment card information or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access our information technology system certain effort may be state sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resource making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect we believe that paypal is particularly attractive target for such breach and attack due to our name and brand recognition and the widespread adoption and use of our product and service although we have developed system and process designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breach and expect to continue to expend significant resource to bolster these protection these security measure can not provide absolute security our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breach and third party may be able to access our customer personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through those system our security measure may also be breached due to human error malfeasance system error or

with our card processor if there is breach of payment card information that we store or that is stored by our direct payment card processing customer we could be liable to the payment card issuing bank for their cost of issuing new card and related expense we also expect to expend significant additional resource to protect against security or privacy breach and may be required to redress problem caused by breach financial service regulator in various jurisdiction including the and the eu have implemented authentication requirement for bank and payment processor intended to reduce online fraud which could impose significant cost require to change our business practice make it more difficult for new customer to join paypal and reduce the ease of use of our product which could harm our business additionally while we maintain insurance policy they may not be adequate to reimburse for loss caused by security breach of contentssystems failure and resulting interruption in the

of our system are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventuality in addition provider of payment solution we are subject to heightened scrutiny by regulator that may require specific business continuity resiliency and disaster recovery plan and more rigorous testing of such plan which may be costly and time consuming and may divert our resource from other business priority we have experienced and expect to continue to experience system failure denial of service attack and other event or condition from time to time that interrupt the

reputation and brand moreover if any system failure or similar event result in damage to our customer or their business partner these customer or partner could seek significant compensation or contractual penalty from for their loss and those claim even if unsuccessful would likely be time consuming and costly for to address and could have other consequence described in this risk factor section under the caption our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breach our payment platform ha experienced and may in the future experience intermittent unavailability the full time availability and expeditious delivery of our product and service is critical to our goal of gaining widespread acceptance among consumer and merchant for digital payment we have undertaken certain system upgrade and platforming effort designed to improve our reliability and speed these effort are costly and time consuming involve significant technical risk and may divert our resource from new feature and product and there can be no guarantee that these effort will succeed because we are regulated financial institution in certain jurisdiction frequent or persistent site interruption could lead to regulatory scrutiny significant fine and penalty and mandatory and costly change to our business practice and ultimately could cause to lose existing license that we need to operate or prevent or delay from obtaining additional license that may be required for our business we also rely on facility component and service supplied by third party including data center facility and cloud storage service if these third party cease to provide the facility or service experience operational interference or disruption breach their agreement with or fail to perform their

consuming if we fail to timely and successfully implement new information system and technology or improvement or upgrade to existing information system and technology or if such system and technology do not operate intended this could have an adverse impact on our business internal control including internal control over financial reporting result of operation and financial condition change to payment card network or bank fee rule or practice could harm our business we rely on bank or other payment processor to process transaction and pay fee for the service from time to time payment card network have increased and may increase in the future the interchange fee and assessment that they charge for each transaction that access their network payment card network have or may impose special fee or assessment for transaction that are executed through digital wallet such paypal which could particularly impact and significantly increase our cost our payment card processor may have the right to pas any increase in interchange fee and assessment on to well increase their own fee for processing any change in interchange fee and assessment could increase our operating cost and reduce our operating income we have entered into strategic partnership with visa and mastercard to further expand our relationship in way that will make it easier for merchant to accept and consumer to choose to pay with visa and mastercard credit and debit card during the term of these agreement visa and mastercard have each agreed to not enact or impose any fee or rule that solely target paypal upon termination of the agreement paypal could become subject to special digital wallet fee or other special assessment of contentsin addition in some jurisdiction governmental regulation have required payment card network to reduce interchange fee any material change in credit or debit card interchange rate in the or other market including result of change in interchange fee limitation could adversely affect our competitive position against traditional credit and debit card service provider and our business we are required by our processor to comply with payment card network operating rule including special operating rule for payment service provider to merchant we have agreed to reimburse our processor for any fine they are assessed by payment card network result of any rule violation by or our merchant the payment card network set and interpret the card operating rule from time to time the network have alleged that various aspect of our business model violate these operating rule if such allegation are not resolved favorably they may result in significant fine and penalty or require change in our business practice that may be costly the payment card network could adopt new operating rule or interpret or re interpret existing rule that we or our processor might find difficult or even impossible to follow or costly to implement result we could lose our ability to give consumer the option of using payment card to fund their payment or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged if we are unable to accept payment card or are limited in our ability to do so our business would be adversely affected we and our payment card processor have implemented specific business process for merchant to comply with payment card network operating rule for providing service to merchant any failure to comply with these rule could result in fine we are also subject to fine from payment card network if we fail to detect that merchant are engaging in activity that are illegal or that are considered high risk including the sale of certain type of digital content for high risk merchant we must either prevent such merchant from using paypal service or register such merchant with the payment card network and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchant although the amount of these fine ha not been material to date additional fine in the future could become significant and could result in termination of our ability to accept payment card or require change in our process for registering new customer which would adversely affect our business payment card network rule may also increase the cost of impose restriction on or otherwise negatively impact the development of our retail point of sale solution which may negatively impact their deployment and adoption failure to deal effectively with fraud fictitious transaction bad transaction and negative customer experience would increase our loss rate and harm our business and could severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our service in the event that merchant do not fulfill their obligation to consumer or merchant good or service do not match the merchant description we may incur substantial loss result of claim from consumer we seek to recover such loss from the merchant but may not be able to recover in full if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay in addition in the event of the bankruptcy or other business interruption of merchant that sell good or service in advance of the date of their delivery or use airline cruise or concert ticket custom made good and subscription we could be liable to the buyer of such good or service either through our buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment card used by customer to fund their payment while we have established reserve based on assumption and estimate that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventuality these reserve may be insufficient we also incur substantial loss from claim that the consumer not authorize the purchase from customer fraud from erroneous transaction and result of customer who have closed bank account or have insufficient fund in their bank account to satisfy payment in addition if loss incurred by related to payment card transaction become excessive they could potentially result in our losing the right to accept payment card for payment which would harm our business we have taken measure to detect and reduce the risk of fraud but these measure need to be continually improved and may not be effective against fraud particularly new and continually evolving form of fraud or in connection with new product offering if these measure do not succeed our business could be harmed we are exposed to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate we have significant operation internationally that are denominated in foreign currency including the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting to foreign currency risk the strengthening or weakening of the dollar versus the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar impact the translation of our net revenue generated in these foreign currency into the dollar in connection with providing our service in multiple currency we may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rate or result of fluctuation in foreign exchange rate between the time that we set them given that we also hold some corporate and customer fund in non currency our financial result are affected by the remeasurement of these non currency into dollar we also have foreign exchange risk on our asset and liability denominated in currency other than the functional currency of our subsidiary while we regularly enter into transaction to hedge foreign currency risk for portion of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure it is of contentsimpossible to predict or eliminate the effect of this exposure fluctuation in foreign exchange rate could materially and adversely impact our financial result any factor that reduce cross border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business cross border trade transaction where the merchant and consumer are in different country is an important source of our revenue and profit cross border transaction generally provide higher revenue and operating income than similar transaction that take place within single country or market cross border trade also represents our primary and in some case our only presence in certain important market cross border trade is subject to and may be negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuation in addition the interpretation and application of law of multiple jurisdiction the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer are often extremely complicated in the context of cross border trade change to or the interpretation and or application of law and regulation applicable to cross border trade could impose additional requirement and restriction impose conflicting obligation and increase the cost associated with cross border trade any factor that increase the cost of cross border trade for or our customer or that restrict delay or make cross border trade more difficult or impractical would lower our revenue and profit and could harm our business the united kingdom departure from the eu could adversely affect the united kingdom held referendum in june in which majority of voter approved an exit from the eu brexit in march the invoked article of the treaty on european union which triggered two year period with extension subject to unanimous consent by the other eu member state during which the government will negotiate it withdrawal agreement with the eu brexit could adversely affect regional including european and worldwide economic and market condition and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange market including volatility in the value of the british pound and euro which in turn could adversely affect our customer and company with which we do business particularly in the in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and see national law and regulation in the diverge from eu law and regulation the determines which eu law to replace or replicate in particular depending on the term of brexit we may face new regulatory cost and challenge including the following we could lose our ability for our eu operation to offer service on cross border basis into the

corresponding ability to work with the luxembourg regulator the lead authority for various aspect of our operation we could be required to obtain additional regulatory permission to operate in the

risk that our business in the could be materially affected or disrupted we could be required to comply with regulatory requirement in the that are in addition to or inconsistent with the regulatory requirement of the eu and our ability to attract and retain the necessary human resource in appropriate location to support the business and the eu business of paypal could be adversely impacted any

adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition the complexity of federal and state regulatory and enforcement regime coupled with the global scope of our operation and the evolving global regulatory environment could result in single event giving rise to large number of overlapping investigation and legal and regulatory proceeding by multiple government authority in different

money transmitter paypal is subject to restriction with respect to the investment of customer fund reporting requirement bonding requirement and inspection by state regulatory agency accordingly if we violate these law or regulation we could be subject to liability and or additional restriction forced to cease business with resident of certain state forced to change our business practice or required to obtain additional license or regulatory approval which could impose substantial cost while we currently allow our customer with payment card to send payment from approximately market we allow customer in only approximately half of those market including the to also receive payment in some case with significant restriction on the manner in which customer can withdraw fund these limitation may adversely affect our ability to grow our business in these market we provide our service to customer in the eu through paypal europe our wholly owned subsidiary that is licensed and

addition eu law and regulation are typically subject to different and potentially inconsistent interpretation by the country that are member of the eu which can make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage moreover the country that are eu member may each have different and potentially inconsistent domestic regulation implementing european directive including the eu

model whereby newly formed category of regulated payment provider would be able to access bank and payment account including paypal account for the purpose of accessing account information or initiating payment on behalf of customer such access could subject to data security and other legal and financial risk and could create new competitive force and new type of competitor in the european payment market seek to regulate more online platform that handle payment for their seller paypal merchant with affected business model which are not licensed or which do not benefit from exemption or integrate compliant marketplace solution may not be able to offer paypal product in the future also imposes new standard for payment security and strong customer authentication that may make it more difficult and time consuming to carry paypal transaction which may adversely impact paypal customer value proposition and it european business of contentsfinally if the business activity of paypal europe exceed certain threshold or if the european central bank ecb determines that paypal europe is significant supervised entity or that some activity of paypal europe is deemed subject to oversight by the ecb paypal europe could become directly regulated by the ecb in addition to the luxembourg regulator the commission de surveillance du secteur financier the cssf it national supervisor which

result in incurring additional cost paypal europe principally offer it service in eu country through passport notification process through the luxembourg regulator to regulator in other eu member state pursuant to eu regulation regulator in these country could notify paypal europe of local consumer protection law that apply to it business in addition to luxembourg consumer protection law and could also seek to persuade the luxembourg regulator to order paypal europe to conduct it or the paypal group activity in the local country directly or through branch office these or similar action by

result in claim or action against including litigation injunction damage award fine or penalty or require to change our business practice in manner that could result in material loss require significant management time result in the diversion of significant operational resource or otherwise harm our business furthermore compliance with economic and trade sanction in force in one jurisdiction may conflict with the law and regulation of other jurisdiction in which we operate and can expose to the risk of fine sanction and penalty anti money laundering and counter terrorist financingwe are subject to various anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing law and regulation around the world that prohibit among other thing our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activity and other regulator globally continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligation which may require to further revise or expand our compliance program including the procedure we use to verify the identity of our customer and to monitor international and domestic transaction many country in which we operate also have anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing law and regulation and we have been and will continue to be required to make change to our compliance program in various jurisdiction in response regulator regularly re examine the transaction volume threshold at which we must obtain and keep applicable record or verify identity of customer and any change in such threshold could result in greater cost for compliance in the eu the implementation of the fourth anti money laundering directive and the regulation on information accompanying transfer of fund commonly known the revised wire transfer regulation are expected to make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage lead to increased friction for customer and result in decrease in business of december paypal europe home state luxembourg had not yet implemented all of the provision of the fourth anti money laundering directive and there is uncertainty to the exact requirement with which paypal europe will be required to comply penalty for non compliance with the fourth anti money laundering directive could include fine of up to of paypal europe total annual turnover eu institution are also proposing change to the fourth anti money

relating to the collection use retention security processing and transfer which we refer to process of personally identifiable information about our customer and employee which we refer to personal

jurisdiction in many case these law apply not only to third party transaction but also to transfer of information between or among our subsidiary and other party with which we have commercial relationship regulatory scrutiny of privacy data protection and the collection use and sharing of data is increasing around the world there is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment relating to privacy and data protection law which continue to develop in way we can not predict including with respect to evolving technology such cloud computing privacy and data protection law may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirement complying with varying jurisdictional requirement could increase the cost and complexity of compliance or require to change our business practice in manner adverse to our business and violation of privacy and data protection related law may expose to significant damage award fine and other penalty that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our business and reputation in addition compliance with inconsistent privacy law may restrict our ability to provide product and service to our customer paypal relies on variety of compliance method to transfer personal data of eu citizen to the including reliance on binding corporate rule bcrs for internal transfer of certain type of personal data and standard contractual clause sccs approved by the european commission for transfer to and from third party paypal must also ensure that third party processing personal data of paypal eu customer and or employee outside of the eu have compliant transfer mechanism in october the european court of justice invalidated eu safe harbor framework clause that were previously relied upon by some paypal vendor to lawfully transfer personal data of eu citizen to company and paypal entered into sccs with those third party who had previously relied on the eu safe harbor framework in july the and eu authority agreed on replacement for safe harbor known privacy shield both the privacy shield framework and sccs are facing legal challenge in the european justice system to the extent that the privacy shield or sccs are invalidated paypal ability to process eu personal data with third party outside of the eu could be jeopardized in the eu adopted comprehensive overhaul of it data protection regime from the current national legislative approach to single european economic area privacy regulation the general data protection regulation gdpr which come into effect in may the proposed eu data protection regime expands the scope of the eu data protection law to all foreign company processing personal data of eu resident imposes strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalty of up to the greater of of worldwide turnover and million and includes new right such the portability of personal data although the gdpr will apply across the eu without need for local implementing legislation local data protection authority dpas will still have the ability to interpret the gdpr through so called opening clause which permit region specific data protection legislation and have the potential to create inconsistency on country by country basis we are evaluating the rule and it requirement implementation of the gdpr could require to change our business practice and increase the cost and complexity of compliance paypal also face additional potential challenge from local dpas because paypal europe is headquartered in luxembourg and subject to regulation bank in that jurisdiction we have relied on the one stop shop concept under which luxembourg ha been our lead data protection regulator in the eu however european court of justice ruling weltimmo affecting company that do business in the eu potentially could make subject to the local data protection law or regulatory enforcement activity of the various eu member state in which we have established legal entity and which apply privacy law that are different than and may conflict with luxembourg privacy law in addition because of the large number of text message email phone call and other communication we send or make to our customer for various business purpose communication related privacy law that provide specified monetary damage award or fine for each violation could result in particularly significant damage award or fine for example under the telephone consumer protection act tcpa in the plaintiff may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damage of per violation whichever is greater and court may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violation we have been and may continue to be subject to lawsuit including class action lawsuit containing allegation that our business violated the tcpa these lawsuit seek damage including statutory damage and injunctive relief among other remedy given the large number of communication we send to our customer determination that there have been violation of the tcpa or other communication based statute could expose to significant damage award that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our business of contentsdata protection privacy and information security have become the subject of increasing public medium regulatory and legislative concern we post on our

experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenue no individual quarter in or accounted for more than of annual net revenue critical accounting policy and estimatesthe application of gaap requires to make estimate and assumption about certain item and future event that directly affect our reported financial condition we have established detailed policy and control procedure to provide reasonable assurance that the method used to make estimate and assumption are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the accounting estimate and assumption discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statement an accounting estimate is considered critical if both the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved and the impact within reasonable range of outcome of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition senior management ha discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimate with the audit risk and compliance committee of our board of director our significant accounting policy including recent accounting pronouncement are described in note overview and summary of significant accounting policy to the consolidated annual financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investor the amount used to ass sensitivity are included to allow user of this report to understand general direction cause and effect of change in the estimate and do not represent management prediction of variability for all of these estimate it should be noted that future event rarely develop exactly forecasted and estimate require regular review and adjustment transaction and loan lossestransaction and loan loss include the expense associated with our customer protection program fraud chargebacks and credit loss associated with our loan receivable balance our transaction and loan loss fluctuate depending on many factor including total tpv macroeconomic condition change to our customer protection program the impact of regulatory change and the credit quality of loan receivable arising from transaction funded with our paypal credit product which include our paypal credit consumer product and merchant loan and advance consisting of paypal working capital and swift business loan and advance to merchant seller we establish allowance for estimated transaction loss arising from processing customer transaction such chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchant related chargebacks due to non delivery of good or service ach return buyer protection program claim account takeover and account overdraft addition to the allowance in the form of provision are reflected in transaction and loan loss in our consolidated statement of income the allowance are monitored regularly and are updated based on actual claim data reported by our claim processor and other actual data received the allowance are based on known fact and circumstance internal factor including experience with similar case historical trend involving loss payment pattern and the mix of transaction and loss type we also establish an allowance for loan receivable which represents our estimate of probable incurred loan loss inherent in our consumer loan receivable and merchant loan and advance increase to the allowance for loan receivable are reflected transaction and loan loss in our consolidated financial statement this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimate and judgment in connection with the pending sale of our consumer credit receivables portfolio to synchrony bank and the designation of that portfolio held for sale in november we released corresponding allowance against those loan and interest receivable balance such allowance on any newly originated consumer loan receivables from and after november of will not be established adjustment to the cost basis of this portfolio which are primarily driven by charge offs are recorded in restructuring and other charge in our consolidated statement of income for our consumer loan receivables not subject to the sale agreement with synchrony bank consisting primarily of our international consumer receivables the allowance is primarily based on forecasted principal balance delinquency rate roll rate roll rate are the percentage of balance which we estimate will migrate from one stage of delinquency to the next based on our historical experience well external factor such estimated bankruptcy and level of unemployment roll rate are applied to the principal amount of our international consumer receivables for each stage of delinquency from current to day past the payment due date in order to estimate the principal loan which have incurred loss and are probable to be charged off for merchant loan and advance receivable that includes paypal working capital and swift business loan and advance product the allowance is primarily based on principal balance forecasted delinquency rate and recovery through the use of vintage based loss forecasting model the determination of delinquency from current to day past due for principal balance related to merchant loan and advance is based on the current expected repayment period of the loan or advance and interest or fixed fee compared to the original expected repayment period for paypal working capital product we calculate the repayment rate based on the merchant expected future payment volume such that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is typically expected to occur within to month from the date of the loan or advance on regular basis we recalculate the repayment period based on the actual repayment activity on the receivable such actual repayment period are dependent on actual payment processing volume the allowance for loss against the interest receivable is primarily determined by applying historical average customer account roll rate to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to project the value of account that have incurred loss and are probable to be charged off the allowance for fee receivable is primarily based on fee balance forecasted delinquency rate and recovery through the use of vintage based loss forecasting model increase to the allowance for fee receivable is recognized reduction in deferred revenue included in other current liability in our consolidated balance sheet we charge off consumer loan receivable balance in the month in which customer balance becomes day past the payment due date we charge off the paypal working capital receivable when the updated repayment period is day past the original expected repayment period and the merchant ha not made payment in the last day we also charge off the receivable when the updated repayment period is day past the original expected repayment period regardless of whether or not the merchant ha made payment within the last day bankrupt account are charged off within day of receiving notification of bankruptcy loan receivable past the payment due date continue to accrue interest until such time they are charged off with the portion of the reserve related to the interest receivable balance classified reduction of revenue for international consumer and recorded in restructuring and other charge for the consumer receivables in our consolidated statement of income for swift business loan and advance product we charge off the receivable when the repayment are day past our expectation of repayment bankrupt account are charged off within day of receiving notification of bankruptcy the provision for loan loss is recognized in transaction and loan loss charge offs that are recovered are recorded reduction to our allowance for loan and interest receivable determining appropriate allowance for these loss is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate loss may vary from the current estimate we regularly update our allowance estimate new fact become known and event occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of loss the allowance are maintained at level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for loss incurred at the balance sheet date based on our result for the year ended december an aggregate ten percent increase in our transaction and loan loss rate would negatively impact transaction and loan loss by approximately million accounting for income tax our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rate and tax planning opportunity available to in the various jurisdiction in which we operate tax law are complex and subject to different interpretation by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authority significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax position including evaluating uncertainty we review our tax position quarterly and adjust the balance new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate that apply to our foreign earnings in addition to local country tax law and regulation our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the through new provision under the tax act such the new gilti tax and beat or result of our indefinite reinvestment assertion indefinite reinvestment is determined by management judgment about and intention concerning our future operation deferred tax asset represent amount available to reduce income tax payable on taxable income in future year such asset arise because of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability well from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deduction and credit by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategy these source of income rely heavily on estimate that are based on of contentsnumber of factor including our historical experience and short range and long range business forecast to the extent deferred tax asset are not expected to be realized we record valuation allowance we recognize and measure uncertain tax position in accordance with gaap pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement from such position are then measured based on the largest benefit that ha greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we report liability for unrecognized tax benefit resulting from uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return gaap further requires that change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax position be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs we recognize interest and penalty if any related to unrecognized tax benefit in income tax expense we file annual income tax return in multiple taxing jurisdiction around the world number of year may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authority and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our reserve for income tax are adequate such that we reflect the benefit more likely than not to be sustained in an examination we adjust these reserve well the related interest where appropriate in light of changing fact and circumstance settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash based on our result for the year ended december one percentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately million loss contingencieswe are currently involved in various claim legal proceeding and investigation of potential operating violation by regulatory oversight authority we regularly review the status of each significant matter and ass our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim legal proceeding or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we accrue liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgment are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceeding the merit of our defense and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel because of uncertainty related to these matter accrual are based only on the best information available at the time additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claim litigation or other violation and may revise our estimate due to the inherent uncertainty of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdiction in which we operate our judgment may be materially different than the actual outcome revenue recognitionapplication of the various accounting principle in gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires to make judgment and estimate complex arrangement with nonstandard term and condition may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting specifically the determination of whether we are principal to transaction gross revenue or an agent net revenue can require considerable judgment further we provide incentive payment to consumer and merchant which require judgment to determine whether the payment should be recorded reduction to gross revenue change in judgment with respect to these assumption and estimate could impact the amount of revenue recognized valuation of goodwill and intangiblesthe valuation of asset acquired in business combination and asset impairment review require the use of significant estimate and assumption the acquisition method of accounting for business combination requires to estimate the fair value of asset acquired liability assumed and any non controlling interest in an acquired business to properly allocate purchase price consideration between asset that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill impairment testing for asset other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset requires the allocation of cash flow to those asset or group of asset and if required an estimate of fair value for the asset or group of asset our estimate are based upon assumption believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable these valuation require the use of management assumption which would not reflect unanticipated event and circumstance that may occur we evaluate goodwill and intangible asset for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicator of impairment exist under the financial accounting standard board fasb guidance the evaluation of indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment allows for qualitative assessment to be performed which is similar to the fasb guidance for evaluating goodwill for impairment of contentsin performing these qualitative assessment we consider relevant event and condition including but not limited to macroeconomic trend industry and market condition overall financial performance cost factor company specific event legal and regulatory factor and our market capitalization if the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset are le than their carrying amount we must perform quantitative impairment test under the quantitative impairment test if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset an impairment loss is recorded in the statement of income measurement of the fair value of reporting unit is based on one or more of the following fair value measure amount at which the unit whole could be bought or sold in current transaction between willing party using present value technique of estimated future cash flow or using valuation technique based on multiple of earnings or revenue or similar performance measure of contentsitem quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskmarket risk is the potential for economic loss to be incurred on market risk sensitive instrument arising from adverse change in market factor such interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and equity price risk management establishes and oversees the implementation of policy governing our investing funding and foreign currency derivative

underlying the customer balance current based on their purpose and availability to fulfill our direct obligation under amount due to customer we seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid asset defined by applicable regulatory requirement and commercial law in the jurisdiction where we operate equal to at least of the aggregate amount of all customer balance we do not pay interest on amount due to customer in the fourth quarter of we entered into an unsecured billion day delayed draw term loan credit facility which is available in up to three borrowing credit agreement in the third quarter of we entered into billion senior unsecured credit facility maturing in credit agreement the company maintains uncommitted credit facility in various region throughout the world aggregating to approximately million borrowing under the credit agreement and credit agreement if any bear interest at floating rate result we will be exposed to fluctuation in interest rate to the extent of our borrowing of december billion wa outstanding under the credit agreement at an interest rate of one month libor plus margin of accordingly at december billion of borrowing capacity wa available for the purpose permitted by the credit agreement subject to customary condition to borrowing of december no borrowing or letter of credit were outstanding under the credit agreement or uncommitted facility interest rate may also adversely impact our customer spending level and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amount owed to higher interest rate often lead to higher payment obligation by customer to and other lender under mortgage credit card and other consumer and merchant loan which may reduce our customer ability to remain current on their obligation to and therefore lead to increased delinquency charge offs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income basis point increase in interest rate would not have had material impact on our financial asset or liability at december and foreign currency riskwe have significant operation internationally that are denominated in foreign currency primarily the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial result we transact business in various foreign currency and have significant international revenue and cost in addition we charge our international subsidiary for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate service our cash flow result of operation and certain of our intercompany balance that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuation may differ materially from expectation and we may record significant gain or loss due to foreign currency fluctuation and related hedging activity we are generally net receiver of foreign currency and therefore benefit from weakening of the dollar and are adversely affected by strengthening of the dollar relative to foreign currency we have foreign exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposure manage these exposure and reduce the potential effect of currency fluctuation on our reported consolidated cash flow and result of operation through the execution of foreign currency exchange contract these foreign currency exchange contract are accounted for derivative instrument for additional detail related to our foreign currency exchange contract please see note derivative instrument to the consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form of contentswe use foreign exchange forward contract to protect our forecasted dollar equivalent earnings from adverse change in foreign currency exchange rate these hedging contract reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movement we designate these contract cash flow hedge for accounting purpose the effective portion of the derivative gain or loss is initially reported component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and subsequently reclassified into revenue in the same period the forecasted transaction affect earnings the ineffective portion of the unrealized gain and loss on these contract if any is recorded immediately in earnings we considered the historical trend in currency exchange rate and determined that it wa reasonably possible that change in exchange rate of for all currency could be experienced in the near term if the dollar weakened by at december and the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign currency exchange forward contract before tax would have been approximately million and million lower respectively if the dollar strengthened by at december and the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign currency exchange forward contract before tax would have been approximately million and million higher respectively we have an additional foreign exchange management program whereby we use foreign currency exchange contract to offset the foreign currency exchange risk on our asset and liability denominated in currency other than the functional currency of our subsidiary these contract are not designated hedging instrument and reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movement on our asset and liability the foreign currency gain and loss on our asset and liability are recorded in other income expense net and are offset by the gain and loss on the foreign currency exchange contract adverse change in exchange rate of for all currency would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income tax of approximately million and million at december and respectively without considering the offsetting effect of hedging foreign currency exchange contract in place of december would have positively impacted income before income tax by approximately million resulting in net negative impact of approximately million foreign currency exchange contract in place of december would have positively impacted income before income tax by approximately million resulting in net negative impact of approximately million these reasonably possible adverse change in currency exchange rate of were applied to total monetary asset and liability denominated in currency other than the functional currency of our subsidiary at the balance sheet date to compute the adverse impact these change would have had on our income before income tax in the near term equity price riskas of december and our cost method investment totaled million and million respectively which represented approximately of our total cash and investment portfolio and were primarily related to cost method
