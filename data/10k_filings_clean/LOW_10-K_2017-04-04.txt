perception of lowe reliable online vendor and source of information about home improvement product and service if we fail to hire train manage and retain qualified sale associate and specialist with expanded skill set or corporate support staff with the capability of delivering on strategic objective we could lose sale to our competitor and our labor cost resulting from operation or the execution of corporate strategy could be negatively affected our customer whether they are homeowner renter or commercial business expect our sale associate and specialist to be well trained and knowledgeable about the product we sell and the home improvement service we provide we compete with other retailer for many of our sale associate and specialist and we invest significantly in them with respect to training and development to strive for high engagement increasingly our sale associate and specialist must have expanded skill set including in some instance the ability to do in home or telephone sale critical challenge we face is attracting and retaining sufficiently diverse workforce that can deliver relevant culturally competent and differentiated experience for wide variety of culturally diverse customer in fact in many of our store our employee must be able to serve customer whose primary language and cultural tradition are different from their own additionally in order to deliver on the omni channel expectation of our customer we rely on the specialized training and capability of corporate support staff which are broadly sought after by our competitor if we are unable to hire train manage and retain qualified sale associate and specialist the quality of service we provide to our customer may decrease and our result of operation could be negatively affected furthermore our ability to meet our labor need while controlling our cost is subject to variety of external factor including wage rate the availability of and competition for talent health care and other benefit cost our brand image and reputation changing demographic and adoption of new or revised employment and labor law and regulation periodically we are subject to labor organizing effort and if we become subject to collective bargaining agreement in the future it could adversely affect how we operate our business and adversely affect our labor cost and our ability to retain qualified workforce positively and effectively managing our public image and reputation is critical to our business success and if our public image and reputation are damaged it could negatively impact our relationship with our customer vendor and store associate and specialist and consequently our business and result of operation our public image and reputation are critical to ensuring that our customer shop at lowe our vendor want to do business with lowe and our sale associate and specialist want to work for lowe we must continue to manage preserve and grow lowe public image and reputation any negative incident can erode trust and confidence quickly and adverse publicity about could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customer confidence reduce demand for our product and service affect our relationship with current and future vendor impact our result of operation and affect our ability to retain and recruit store associate and specialist the significant expansion in the use of social medium over recent year ha compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by such negative incident strategic transaction such our acquisition of rona involve risk and we may not realize the expected benefit because of numerous uncertainty and risk we regularly consider and enter into strategic transaction including merger acquisition joint venture investment and other growth market and geographic expansion strategy with the expectation that these transaction will result in increase in of contentssales cost saving synergy and other various benefit our ability to deliver the expected benefit from any strategic transaction is subject to numerous uncertainty and risk including our ability to integrate personnel labor model financial it and other system successfully disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management hiring additional management and other critical personnel and increasing the scope geographic diversity and complexity of our operation effective internal control are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial report and the integration of business may create complexity in our financial system and internal control and make them more difficult to manage integration of business into our internal control system could cause to fail to meet our financial reporting obligation additionally any impairment of goodwill or other asset acquired or divested in strategic transaction or charge to earnings associated with any strategic transaction may materially reduce our earnings our shareholder may react unfavorably to our strategic transaction and if we do not realize any anticipated benefit from such transaction we may be exposed to additional liability of any acquired business or joint venture and we may be exposed to litigation in connection with the strategic transaction further we may finance these strategic transaction by incurring additional debt which could increase leverage or impact our ability to access capital in the future failure to achieve and maintain high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customer and negatively impact our sale profitability cash flow and financial condition product and service quality issue could result in negative impact on customer confidence in lowe and our brand image if our product and service offering do not meet applicable safety standard or our customer expectation regarding safety or quality we could experience lost sale and increased cost and be exposed to legal financial and reputational risk actual potential or perceived product safety concern could expose to litigation well government enforcement action and result in costly product recall and other liability result lowe reputation retailer of high quality product and service including both national and lowe private brand could suffer and impact customer loyalty we have many competitor who could take sale and market share from if we fail to execute our merchandising marketing and distribution strategy effectively or if they develop substantially more effective or lower cost mean of meeting customer need resulting in negative impact on our business and result of operation we operate in highly competitive market for home improvement product and service and have numerous large and small direct and indirect competitor the principal competitive factor in our industry include convenience customer service quality and price of merchandise and service in stock level and merchandise assortment and presentation we face growing competition from online and multi channel retailer who have similar product or service offering customer are increasingly able to quickly comparison shop and determine real time product availability and price using digital tool our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressure and change in the market for home improvement product and service could affect our financial performance moreover change in the promotional pricing and other practice of our competitor including the effect of competitor liquidation activity may impact our result our inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationship with selected supplier of brand name product could negatively impact our business operation and financial result we form strategic relationship with selected supplier to market and develop product under variety of recognized and respected national and international brand name we also have relationship with certain supplier to enable to sell proprietary product which differentiate from other retailer the inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationship with these supplier could negatively impact our business operation and financial result failure of key vendor or service provider that we can not quickly replace could disrupt our operation and negatively impact our business financial condition and result of operation we rely upon number of vendor the sole or primary source of some of the product we sell we also rely upon many independent service provider for technology solution and other service that are important to many aspect of our business many of these vendor and service provider have certain product or specialized skill needed to support our business concept and our strategy if these vendor or service provider discontinue operation or are unable to perform expected or if we fail to manage them properly and we are unable to replace them quickly our business could be adversely affected at least temporarily we are able to replace them and potentially in some case permanently if our domestic or international supply chain or our fulfillment network for our product is ineffective or disrupted for any reason or if these operation are subject to trade policy change our result of operation could be adversely affected we source stock and sell product from domestic and international vendor and their ability to reliably and efficiently fulfill our order is critical to our business success we source large number of our product from foreign manufacturer with china continuing to be the dominant import source the result of the november election may signal change in trade policy the united state and other country because we source large percentage of our merchandise from outside the united state major change in tax policy or trade relation such the disallowance of tax deduction for imported of contentsmerchandise or the imposition of additional tariff or duty on imported product could adversely affect our business result of operation effective income tax rate liquidity and net income financial instability among key vendor political instability and labor unrest in source country or elsewhere in our supply chain change in the cost of commodity in our supply chain fuel labor and currency exchange rate port labor dispute and security the outbreak of pandemic weather related event natural disaster work stoppage shipping capacity restrains change in trade policy retaliatory trade restriction imposed by either the united state or major source country tariff or duty fluctuation in currency exchange rate and transport availability capacity and cost are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted

technology program well purchase of merchandise inventory letter of credit are issued primarily for insurance and construction contract critical accounting policy and estimatesthe preparation of the consolidated financial statement and note to consolidated financial statement presented in this annual report requires to make estimate that affect the reported amount of asset liability sale and expense and related disclosure of contingent asset and liability we base these estimate on historical result and various other assumption believed to be reasonable all of which form the basis for making estimate concerning the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily available from other source actual result may differ from these estimate our significant accounting policy are described in note to the consolidated financial statement we believe that the following accounting policy affect the most significant estimate and management judgment used in preparing the consolidated financial statement of contentsmerchandise inventorydescriptionwe record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventory below cost this reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory level sale trend and historical experience during our reserve increased approximately million to million of february we also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventory this reserve is based primarily on actual shrinkage result from previous physical inventory during the inventory shrinkage reserve increased approximately million to million of february in addition we receive fund from vendor in the normal course of business principally result of purchase volume sale early payment or promotion of vendor product generally these vendor fund do not represent the reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable cost that we incurred to sell the vendor product therefore we treat these fund reduction in the cost of inventory the amount are accrued and recognize these fund reduction of cost of sale when the inventory is sold fund that are determined to be reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable cost incurred to sell vendor product are recorded an offset to the related expense judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimatewe do not believe that our merchandise inventory are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practice based on anticipated sale trend and general economic condition however change in consumer purchasing pattern or deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserve likewise change in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary based on the timing and result of physical inventory we also apply judgment in the determination of level of obsolete inventory and assumption about net realizable value for vendor fund we develop accrual rate based on the provision of the agreement in place due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreement we perform analysis and review historical purchase trend and volume throughout the year adjust accrual rate appropriate and confirm actual amount with select vendor to ensure the amount earned are appropriately recorded amount accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volume differ from projected purchase volume especially in the case of program that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volume are met effect if actual result differ from assumptionswe have not made any material change in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserve for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal year we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimate for both of these inventory reserve however it is possible that actual result could differ from recorded reserve change in either the amount of product considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately million for change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrinkage reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately million for we have not made any material change in the methodology used to recognize vendor fund during the past three fiscal year if actual result are not consistent with the assumption and estimate used we could be exposed to additional adjustment that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory however substantially all receivables associated with these activity do not require subjective long term estimate because they are collected within the following fiscal year adjustment to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material impairment of investmentsdescriptionwe use the equity method to account for investment in company if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over operating and financial policy of the investee our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these company is included in consolidated net earnings we use the cost method to account for investment in company for which we do not exercise significant influence each of the company equity method and cost method investment are subject to review for impairment if and when circumstance indicate that the fair value of our investment could be le than the carrying value evidence considered in this evaluation includes but would not necessarily be limited to the financial condition and near term prospect of the investee recent operating trend and forecasted performance of the investee market condition in the geographic area or industry in which the investee operates and the company strategic plan for holding the investment in relation to the period of time expected for an anticipated recovery of it carrying value if of contentsthe result of our review indicate an other than temporary decline in the carrying value of our investment the company would write the investment to it estimated fair value judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimateour impairment evaluation for equity method and cost method investment require to apply judgment in determining whether decrease in value that is other than temporary ha occurred if we need to ass the recoverability of our investment we will make assumption regarding estimated future cash flow of those investment these calculation require to apply judgment including assumption of future performance based on business plan and forecast recent economic and business trend and competitive condition effect if actual result differ from assumptionswe own one third share in hydrox holding pty ltd joint venture with woolworth limited woolworth which operates master home improvement store and home timber and hardware group retail store and wholesale distribution in australia result of our decision to exit the investment in woolworth is required to purchase lowe one third share of the joint venture at fair value of january the date of our notification of our intention to exit the process for the two party agreeing on fair value is prescribed in the joint venture agreement during the third quarter of fiscal year woolworth claimed unilateral termination of the joint venture agreement and executed other agreement to initiate the wind down of hydrox without the company approval required under the joint venture agreement due to this lowe ha concluded that under applicable accounting standard the investment should be accounted for cost method investment going forward result of this determination accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment of million were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into the carrying value of the cost method investment in addition the unilateral action of woolworth to begin the liquidation of hydrox represented triggering event requiring the company to evaluate the cost method investment for impairment management determined that the requirement for determining impairment were met and leveraged wind down cash flow projection in determining the estimated fair value of the entity the value wa determined using an income approach based upon the expected future cash flow generated from the settlement of asset and liability inclusive of inventory property payable lease liability and employee entitlement result the company recorded million non cash impairment charge during the third quarter of fiscal to reflect it estimated portion of the overall joint venture fair value in wind down the assumption that most significantly affect the fair value determination include the projected future cash anticipated in the settlement of asset and liability by woolworth further change in this estimate are possible the party proceed through the final stage of the valuation process defined in the joint venture agreement the carrying value of the investment of february is million change in our current estimate of fair value of the joint venture would have affected net earnings by approximately million for long lived asset impairmentdescriptionwe review the carrying amount of location whenever certain event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable when evaluating location for impairment our asset group is at an individual location level that is the lowest level for which cash flow are identifiable cash flow for individual location do not include an allocation of corporate overhead we evaluate location for triggering event relating to long lived asset impairment on quarterly basis to determine when location asset carrying value may not be recoverable for operating location our primary indicator that asset carrying value may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for month period for those location that have been open in the same location for sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating result management also monitor other factor when evaluating operating location for impairment including individual location execution of their operating plan and local market condition including incursion which is the opening of either other lowe location or those of direct competitor within the same market we also consider there to be triggering event when there is current expectation that it is more likely than not that given location will be closed significantly before the end of it previously estimated useful life potential impairment ha occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location asset are le than the carrying amount of the asset when determining the stream of projected future cash flow associated with an individual operating location management make assumption incorporating local market condition about key store variable including sale growth rate gross margin and controllable expense such store payroll and occupancy expense well asset residual value or lease rate an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds it fair value of contentswe use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating location which requires discounting projected future cash flow this involves making assumption regarding both location future cash flow described above and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flow we discount our cash flow estimate at rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participant would assign to the cash flow the selected market participant represent group of other retailer with market footprint similar in size to ours judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimateour impairment evaluation for long lived asset require to apply judgment in determining whether triggering event ha occurred including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that location will be closed significantly before the end of it previously estimated useful life our impairment loss calculation require to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flow including estimated sale margin and controllable expense assumption about market performance for operating location and estimated selling price or lease rate for location identified for closure we also apply judgment in estimating asset fair value including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair value determined using an income approach effect if actual result differ from assumptionsduring operating location experienced triggering event and were evaluated for recoverability eleven of the operating location were determined to be impaired due to decline in recent cash flow trend and an unfavorable sale outlook resulting in an impairment loss of million during compared to impairment loss of million related to two operating location impaired during three of the operating location that experienced triggering event during were determined to be recoverable and therefore were not impaired reduction in projected sale used to estimate future cash flow for these operating location would not have had significant impact to impairment loss recognized during we have not made any material change in the methodology used to estimate the future cash flow of operating location or location identified for closure during the past three fiscal year if the actual result are not consistent with the assumption and judgment we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that location will be closed significantly before the end of it useful life or in estimating future cash flow and determining asset fair value our actual impairment loss could vary positively or negatively from our estimated impairment loss goodwilldescriptiongoodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at least annually on the first day of the fourth quarter or whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may not be recoverable we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below the operating segment level the evaluation begin with qualitative assessment to determine whether quantitative impairment test is necessary if after assessing qualitative factor we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is le than the carrying amount then the two step goodwill impairment test is necessary the first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compare the fair value of reporting unit with it carrying amount including goodwill fair value represents the price market participant would be willing to pay in potential sale of the reporting unit and is based on discounted future cash flow if the fair value exceeds carrying value then no goodwill impairment ha occurred if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds it fair value second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss the second step includes hypothetically valuing the tangible and intangible asset and liability of the reporting unit if the reporting unit had been acquired in business combination then the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimatethe determination of the fair value of the reporting unit requires to make significant estimate and assumption including store growth rate existing store sale growth rate forecasting expense and selecting appropriate discount rate effect if actual result differ from assumptionsduring the third quarter of fiscal year we determined our orchard supply hardware orchard reporting unit wa impaired we recorded impairment loss related to the orchard reporting unit of million which represented the entire amount of goodwill allocated to this reporting unit of contentsthe carrying value of goodwill of february wa billion we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in the future estimate or assumption we use to test for impairment loss on goodwill however if actual result are not consistent with our estimate or assumption we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material self insurancedescriptionwe are self insured for certain loss relating to worker compensation automobile general and product liability extended protection plan and certain medical and dental claim our self insured retention or deductible applicable is limited to million per occurrence involving worker compensation million per occurrence involving general or product liability and million per occurrence involving automobile we do not have any insurance coverage for self insured extended protection plan or medical and dental claim self insurance claim filed and claim incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimate of the discounted ultimate cost for self insured claim incurred using actuarial assumption followed in the insurance industry and historical experience during our self insurance liability decreased approximately million to million of february judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimatethese estimate are subject to change in the regulatory environment utilized discount rate projected exposure including payroll sale and vehicle unit well the frequency lag and severity of claim effect if actual result differ from assumptionswe have not made any material change in the methodology used to establish our self insurance liability during the past three fiscal year although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate loss related to claim it is possible that actual result could differ from recorded self insurance liability change in our self insurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately million for basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately million for revenue recognitiondescriptionsee note to the consolidated financial statement for discussion of our revenue recognition policy the following accounting estimate relating to revenue recognition require management to make assumption and apply judgment regarding the effect of future event that can not be determined with certainty we sell separately priced extended protection plan contract under lowe branded program for which the company is ultimately self insured the company recognizes revenue from extended protection plan sale on straight line basis over the respective contract term extended protection plan contract term primarily range from one to four year from the date of purchase or the end of the manufacturer warranty applicable the company consistently group and evaluates extended protection plan contract based on the characteristic of the underlying product and the coverage provided in order to monitor for expected loss loss on the overall contract would be recognized if the expected cost of performing service under the contract exceeded the amount of unamortized acquisition cost and related deferred revenue associated with the contract deferred revenue associated with the extended protection plan contract increased million to million of february we defer revenue and cost of sale associated with settled transaction for which customer have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation ha not yet been completed revenue is deferred based on the actual amount received we use historical gross margin rate to estimate the adjustment to cost of sale for these transaction during deferred revenue associated with these transaction increased million to million of february judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimatefor extended protection plan there is judgment inherent in our evaluation of expected loss result of our methodology for grouping and evaluating extended protection plan contract and from the actuarial determination of the estimated cost of the contract there is also judgment inherent in our determination of the recognition pattern of cost of performing service under these contract of contentsfor the deferral of revenue and cost of sale associated with transaction for which customer have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation ha not yet been completed there is judgment inherent in our estimate of gross margin rate effect if actual result differ from assumptionswe have not made any material change in the methodology used to recognize revenue on our extended protection plan contract during the past three fiscal year we currently do not anticipate incurring any overall contract loss on our extended protection plan contract although we believe that we have the ability to adequately monitor and estimate expected loss under the extended protection plan contract it is possible that actual result could differ from our estimate in addition if future evidence indicates that the cost of performing service under these contract are incurred on other than straight line basis the timing of revenue recognition under these contract could change change in the amount of revenue recognized in under these contract would have affected net earnings by approximately million we have not made any material change in the methodology used to reverse net sale and cost of sale related to amount received for which customer have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation ha not yet been completed we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimate related to the impact to cost of sale for these transaction however if actual result are not consistent with our estimate or assumption we may incur additional income or expense change in the estimate of the gross margin rate applied to these transaction would have affected net earnings by approximately million in disclosure regarding forward looking statementswe speak throughout this annual report in forward looking statement about our future but particularly in management discussion

quantitative information about interest rate risk is not meaningful for our financial instrument commodity price riskwe purchase certain commodity product that are subject to price volatility caused
