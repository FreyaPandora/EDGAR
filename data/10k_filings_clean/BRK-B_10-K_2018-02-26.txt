similar expression are subject to certain risk and uncertainty in it business operation which are described below the risk and uncertainty described below are not the only risk we face additional risk and uncertainty that are presently unknown or are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operation we are dependent on few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decision major investment decision and all major capital allocation decision are made by warren buffett chairman of the board of director and chief executive officer age in consultation with charles munger vice chairman of the board of director age if for any reason the service of our key personnel particularly mr buffett were to become unavailable there could be material adverse effect on our operation however berkshire board of director ha identified certain current berkshire subsidiary manager who in their judgment are capable of succeeding mr buffett and ha agreed on replacement for mr buffett replacement be needed currently the board continually monitor this risk and could alter it current view regarding replacement for mr buffett in the future we believe that the board succession plan together with the outstanding manager running our numerous and highly diversified operating unit help to mitigate this risk we need qualified personnel to manage and operate our various business in our decentralized business model we need qualified and competent management to direct day to day business activity of our operating subsidiary and to manage change in future business operation due to changing business or regulatory environment our operating subsidiary also need qualified and competent personnel in executing their business plan and serving their customer supplier and other stakeholder our inability to recruit and retain qualified and competent manager and personnel could negatively affect the operating result financial condition and liquidity of our subsidiary and berkshire whole table of content the past growth rate in berkshire book value per share is not an indication of future result in the year since present management acquired control of berkshire our book value per share ha grown at highly satisfactory rate because of the large size of our capital base berkshire shareholder equity wa approximately billion of december our book value per share will very likely not increase in the future at rate close to it past rate investment are unusually concentrated and fair value are subject to loss in value we concentrate high percentage of the investment of our insurance subsidiary in relatively small number of equity security and diversify our investment portfolio far le than is conventional in the insurance industry significant decline in the fair value of our larger investment may produce material decline in our consolidated shareholder equity and our consolidated book value per share beginning in all change in the fair value of equity security whether realized or unrealized will be recognized gain or loss in our consolidated statement of earnings accordingly significant decline in the fair value of these security will produce significant decline in our reported earnings since large percentage of our equity security are held by our insurance subsidiary significant decrease in the fair value of these investment will produce significant decline in statutory surplus our large statutory surplus is competitive advantage and material decline could have materially adverse effect on our claim paying ability rating and our ability to write new insurance business thus potentially reducing our future underwriting profit competition and technology may erode our business franchise and result in lower earnings each of our operating business face intense competitive pressure within market in which they operate while we manage our business with the objective of achieving long term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantage many factor including market and technology change may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantage accordingly future operating result will depend to some degree on whether our operating unit are successful in protecting or enhancing their competitive advantage if our operating business are unsuccessful in these effort our periodic operating result in the future may decline deterioration of general economic condition may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to access capital market at reasonable cost our operating business are subject to normal economic cycle affecting the economy in general or the industry in which they operate to the extent that the economy deteriorates for prolonged period of time one or more of our significant operation could be materially harmed in addition our utility and energy business and our railroad business regularly utilize debt component of their capital structure these business depend on having access to borrowed fund through the capital market at reasonable rate to the extent that access to the capital market is restricted or the cost of funding increase these operation could be adversely affected terrorist act could hurt our operating business successful defined by the aggressor cyber biological nuclear or chemical attack could produce significant loss to our worldwide operation our business operation could be adversely affected directly through the loss of human resource or destruction of production facility and information system this is risk that we share with all business regulatory change may adversely impact our future operating result in recent year partially in response to financial market crisis global economic recession and social and environmental issue regulatory initiative have accelerated in the united state and abroad such initiative address for example the regulation of bank and other major financial institution environmental and global warming matter and health care reform these initiative impact not only our regulated insurance energy and railroad transportation business but also our manufacturing service retailing and financing business increased regulatory compliance cost could have significant negative impact on our operating business well on the business in which we have significant but not controlling economic interest we can not predict whether such initiative will have material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position result of operation or cash flow table of content cyber security risk we rely on information technology in virtually all aspect of our business like those of many large business certain of our information technology system have been subject to computer virus malicious code unauthorized access phishing effort denial of service attack and other cyber attack and we expect to be subject to similar attack in the future such attack become more sophisticated and frequent significant disruption or failure of our information technology system could result in service interruption safety failure security violation regulatory compliance failure an inability to protect information and asset against intruder and other operational difficulty attack perpetrated against our information system could result in loss of asset and critical information and expose to remediation cost and reputational damage although we have taken step intended to mitigate these risk including business continuity planning disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis significant disruption or cyber intrusion could lead to misappropriation of asset or data corruption and could adversely affect our result of operation financial condition and liquidity additionally if we are unable to acquire implement or protect right around new technology we may suffer competitive disadvantage which could also have an adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity cyber attack could further adversely affect our ability to operate facility information technology and business system or compromise confidential customer and employee information political economic social or financial market instability or damage to or interference with our operating asset customer or supplier may result in business interruption lost revenue higher commodity price disruption in fuel supply lower energy consumption unstable market increased security repair or other cost may materially adversely affect in way that can not be predicted at this time any of these risk could materially affect our consolidated financial result furthermore instability in the financial market resulting from terrorism sustained or significant cyber attack or war could also have material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital these are risk we share with all business derivative contract may require significant cash settlement payment and result in significant loss in the future we have assumed the risk of potentially significant loss under equity index put option contract although we received considerable premium compensation for accepting these risk there is no assurance that the premium we received will exceed our aggregate settlement payment risk of loss under our equity index put option contract are based on decline in equity price of stock comprising certain major stock index when these contract expire beginning in we could be required to make significant payment if equity index price are significantly below the strike price specified in the contract equity index put option contract are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet and the periodic change in fair value are reported in earnings currently the valuation of these contract are primarily dependent on the related index value material decrease in index value may result in material loss in periodic earnings risk unique to our regulated business our tolerance for risk in our insurance business may result in significant underwriting loss when properly paid for the risk assumed we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from single event than any other insurer ha knowingly assumed accordingly we could incur significant loss from single event we may also write coverage for loss arising from act of terrorism we attempt to take into account all possible correlation and avoid writing group of policy from which pre tax loss might aggregate above billion currently we estimate that our aggregate exposure from single event under outstanding policy is significantly below billion however despite our effort loss may aggregate in unanticipated way our tolerance for significant insurance loss may result in lower reported earnings or net loss in future period the degree of estimation error inherent in the process of estimating property and casualty insurance loss reserve may result in significant underwriting loss the principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claim in writing property and casualty insurance policy we receive premium today and promise to pay covered loss in the future however it will take decade before all claim that have occurred of any given balance sheet date will be reported and settled although we believe that liability for unpaid loss are adequate we will not know whether these liability or the premium charged for the coverage provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date estimating insurance claim cost is inherently imprecise our estimated unpaid loss arising under contract covering property and casualty insurance risk are large billion at december even small percentage increase to the aggregate liability estimate can result in materially lower future periodic reported earnings table of content change in regulation and regulatory action can adversely affect our operating result and our ability to allocate capital our insurance business are subject to regulation in the jurisdiction in which we operate such regulation may relate to among other thing the type of business that can be written the rate that can be charged for coverage the level of capital that must be maintained and restriction on the type and size of investment that can be made regulation may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payment to berkshire by these business accordingly change in regulation related to these or other matter or regulatory action imposing restriction on our insurance company may adversely impact our result of operation and restrict our ability to allocate capital our railroad business conducted through bnsf is also subject to significant number of governmental law and regulation with respect to rate and practice tax railroad operation and variety of health safety labor environmental and other matter failure to comply with applicable law and regulation could have material adverse effect on bnsf business government may change the legislative and or regulatory framework within which bnsf operates without providing any recourse for any adverse effect that the change may have on the business for example federal legislation enacted in and amended in mandate the implementation of positive train control technology by december on certain mainline track where inter city and commuter passenger railroad operate and where toxic by inhalation tih hazardous material are transported complying with legislative and regulatory change may pose significant operating and implementation risk and require significant capital expenditure bnsf derives significant amount of revenue from the transportation of energy related commodity particularly coal to the extent that change in government policy limit or restrict the usage of coal source of fuel in generating electricity or alternate fuel such natural gas displace coal on competitive basis revenue and earnings could be adversely affected common carrier bnsf is also required to transport tih chemical and other hazardous material an accidental release of hazardous material could expose bnsf to significant claim loss penalty and environmental remediation obligation change in the regulation of the rail industry could negatively impact bnsf ability to determine price for rail service and to make capital improvement to it rail network resulting in an adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition or liquidity our utility and energy business operated under bhe are highly regulated by numerous federal state local and foreign governmental authority in the jurisdiction in which they operate these law and regulation are complex dynamic and subject to new interpretation and or change regulation affect almost every aspect of our utility and energy business regulation broadly apply and may limit management ability to independently make and implement decision regarding numerous matter including acquiring business constructing acquiring or disposing of operating asset operating and maintaining generating facility and transmission and distribution system asset complying with pipeline safety and integrity and environmental requirement setting rate charged to customer establishing capital structure and issuing debt or equity security transacting between our domestic utility and our other subsidiary and affiliate and paying dividend or similar distribution failure to comply with or reinterpretation of existing regulation and new legislation or regulation such those relating to air and water quality renewable portfolio standard cyber security emission performance standard climate change coal combustion byproduct disposal hazardous and solid waste disposal protected specie and other environmental matter or change in the nature of the regulatory process may have significant adverse impact on our financial result our railroad business requires significant ongoing capital investment to improve and maintain it railroad network so that transportation service can be safely and reliably provided to customer on timely basis our utility and energy business also require significant amount of capital to construct operate and maintain generation transmission and distribution system to meet their customer need and reliability criterion additionally system asset may need to be operational for long period of time in order to justify the financial investment the risk of operational or financial failure of capital project is not necessarily recoverable through rate that are charged to customer further significant portion of cost of capital improvement are funded through debt issued by bnsf and bhe and their subsidiary

however we consider investment gain and loss whether realized or unrealized non operating based on our long held philosophy of acquiring security and holding those security for long period accordingly we believe that such gain and loss are not predictable or necessarily meaningful in understanding the operating result of our insurance operation the timing and amount of catastrophe loss can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting result particularly with respect to our reinsurance business generally we consider pre tax catastrophe loss in excess of million from current year

affecting our liability estimate include projection of ultimate claim count frequency and average loss per claim severity we utilize combination of several actuarial estimation method including bornhuetter ferguson and chain ladder methodology claim liability estimate for automobile liability coverage such bodily injury bi uninsured motorist and personal injury protection are more uncertain due to the longer claim tail so we establish additional case development estimate of december case development liability averaged approximately of the case reserve we select case development factor through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liability for incurred but not reported ibnr claim liability are based on projection of the ultimate number of claim expected reported and unreported for each significant coverage we use historical claim count data to develop age to age projection of the ultimate count by quarterly accident period from which we deduct reported claim to produce the number of unreported claim we estimate the average cost per unreported claim and apply such estimate to the unreported claim count producing an ibnr liability estimate we may record additional ibnr estimate when actuarial technique are difficult to apply we test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liability using one or more actuarial projection based on claim closure model and paid and incurred loss triangle each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claim occurring in given period and project the ultimate cost our claim liability estimate recorded at the end of increased million during which produced corresponding decrease to pre tax earnings we modified the assumption used to estimate liability at december to reflect the most recent frequency and severity result future development of recorded liability will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or le than anticipated with respect to liability for bi claim our most significant claim category we believe it is reasonably possible that average severity will change by at least one percentage point from the severity used in establishing the recorded liability at december we estimate that one percentage point increase or decrease in bi severity would produce million increase or decrease in recorded liability with corresponding decrease or increase in pre tax earnings many of the economic force that would likely cause bi severity to differ from expectation would likely also cause severity for other injury coverage to differ in the same direction berkshire hathaway reinsurance group bhrg bhrg liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense derive primarily from reinsurance contract issued through the nico group and the general re group in connection with reinsurance contract the nature extent timing and perceived reliability of premium and loss information received from ceding company varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting term contract term condition and coverage also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policy the nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative individual risk per occurrence excess or retroactive reinsurance contract may not differ significantly from the information received under primary insurance contract if reinsurer personnel either work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claim or manage the claim themselves however loss information is often le detailed with respect to aggregate excess of loss and quota share contract additionally loss information we receive through periodic report is often in summary format rather than on an individual claim basis loss data includes recoverable paid loss well case loss estimate ceding company infrequently provide ibnr estimate to reinsurers loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurer periodic premium and claim report are required from ceding company in the such report are generally required at quarterly interval ranging from to day after the end of the quarterly period outside of the reinsurance reporting practice may vary further in certain country client report annually often to day after the end of the annual period in some instance reinsurers assume and cede underlying risk thereby creating multiple contractual party between and the primary insured potentially compounding the claim reporting delay the relative impact of reporting delay on the reinsurer may vary

discussion and analysis continued property and casualty loss continued berkshire hathaway reinsurance group bhrg continued reinsurers the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed

the reported information in the normal course of business dispute occasionally arise concerning whether claim are covered by our reinsurance policy we resolve most coverage dispute through negotiation

in the table above consist primarily of traditional property and casualty coverage written primarily under excess of loss and quota share treaty under certain contract coverage can apply to multiple line of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such line consistently if at all in those instance we allocated loss to property and casualty coverage based on internal estimate with respect to the general re group we use variety of actuarial methodology to establish unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense certain methodology such paid and incurred loss development technique incurred and paid loss bornhuetter ferguson technique and frequency and severity technique are utilized well ground up technique when appropriate the critical process involved in estimating unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense include the establishment of case liability estimate the determination of expected loss ratio and loss reporting pattern which drive ibnr liability estimate and the comparison of reported activity to the expected loss reporting pattern general re group process for estimating unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense start with case loss estimate reported by ceding company we independently evaluate certain reported case loss and if appropriate we use our own case liability estimate of december our case loss estimate exceeded ceding company estimate by approximately billion which were concentrated in legacy worker compensation claim occurring over year ago we also periodically conduct detailed review of individual client claim which may cause to adjust our case estimate in estimating general re group ibnr liability we consider expected case loss emergence and development pattern together with expected loss ratio by year in this process we classify all loss and premium data into group or portfolio of policy based primarily on product type treaty facultative and program line of business auto liability property and worker compensation and or geographic jurisdiction and in some case contractual feature or market segment for each portfolio we aggregate premium and loss by accident year or coverage period and analyze the paid and incurred loss data over time we estimate the expected development of reported claim which together with the expected loss ratio are used to calculate ibnr liability estimate factor affecting our loss development analysis include but are not limited to change in the following client claim reporting and settlement practice the frequency of client company claim review policy term and coverage such loss retention level and occurrence and aggregate policy limit loss trend and legal trend that result in unanticipated loss collectively these factor influence our selection of expected case loss emergence pattern for the nico group we generally also establish reinsurance claim liability on contract by contract basis determined from reported case loss estimate reported by ceding company and ibnr liability that are primarily function of an anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate liability are subsequently adjusted over time to reflect case loss reported versus expected case loss which are used to form judgment on the adequacy of the expected loss ratio and the level of ibnr liability required for unreported claim anticipated loss ratio are also

hathaway reinsurance group bhrg continued certain catastrophe individual risk and aviation excess of loss contract tend to generate low frequency high severity loss our process and technique for estimating liability under such contract generally rely more on per policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development pattern of past loss in the aggregate we reduced net loss for prior year occurrence by million in which produced corresponding increase in pre tax earnings reported claim for prior year property loss event were le than anticipated and we reduced our estimated ultimate liability by million however property loss incurred during any given period may be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophe and large individual property loss event in reported nominal loss for prior year worker compensation claim of the general re group were le than expected after reevaluating expected remaining ibnr estimate we reduced our liability by million an increase of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratio would produce net increase in worker compensation ibnr liability of approximately billion producing corresponding decrease in pre tax earnings we believe it is reasonably possible for these assumption to increase at these rate we reduced general re group other casualty excluding asbestos and environmental estimated ultimate loss for prior year event by million in reflecting lower than expected reported loss resulting in million increase in pre tax earnings for our significant casualty and general liability portfolio we estimate that an increase of five percent in the claim tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and five percent increase in expected loss ratio would produce net increase in our nominal ibnr liability and corresponding reduction in pre tax earnings of approximately million while we believe it is reasonably possible for these assumption to increase at these rate more likely outcome are le than million given the diversification in worldwide business overall industry wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability such for asbestos environmental and latent injury liability estimate our combined net liability for such loss at december were approximately billion which included an increase in estimated ultimate loss of approximately million during which produced corresponding reduction in pre tax earnings loss estimation for these exposure are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increase may be required in the future if new exposure or claimant are identified new claim are reported or new theory of liability emerge in addition to the previously described methodology we consider survival ratio which is the average net claim payment in recent year in relation to net unpaid loss rough guide to reserve adequacy our survival ratio wa approximately year of december retroactive reinsurance our retroactive reinsurance contract cover loss event

very long our gross unpaid loss deferred charge asset and net liability at december were follows in million gross unpaid loss deferred charge liability net ofdeferred charge december our contract are generally subject to maximum limit of indemnification we currently expect that maximum remaining gross loss payable under our retroactive policy will not exceed billion due to the applicable aggregate contract limit absent significant judicial or legislative change affecting asbestos environmental or latent injury exposure we also currently believe it unlikely that loss will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than of our billion estimated liability at december we establish liability estimate by individual contract considering exposure and development trend in establishing our liability estimate we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment pattern and project expected ultimate loss under various scenario we assign judgmental probability factor to these scenario and an expected outcome is determined we then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company report and other available information concerning the underlying loss we re estimate the expected ultimate loss when significant event or significant deviation from expected result are revealed table of content management discussion and analysis continued property and

respect to multi line or aggregate excess of loss policy when possible we conduct detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured loss when detailed loss information is unavailable we develop estimate by applying recent industry trend and projection to aggregate client data judgment in these area necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect these claim will be adjudicated legal reform and legislation could also have significant impact on our ultimate liability change in ultimate estimated liability for prior year retroactive reinsurance contract were relatively insignificant in were change in the estimated timing and amount of remaining unpaid loss in we paid loss and loss adjustment expense of approximately billion with respect to these contract in connection with our retroactive reinsurance contract we also record deferred charge asset which at contract inception represents the excess if any of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid loss over premium we amortize deferred charge asset which produce charge to pre tax earnings in future period based on the expected timing and amount of loss payment we also adjust deferred charge balance due to change in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payment significant change in such estimate may have significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balance and the amount of periodic amortization based on the contract in effect of december we currently estimate that amortization expense in will approximate billion derivative contract liability we measure derivative contract liability at fair value our remaining significant derivative contract exposure relate to equity index put option contract written between and our recorded liability are based on model there are essentially no observable price for comparable contract actual value in an exchange may differ significantly from the value produced by such model transaction value may also reflect the prevailing perception of individual buyer and seller and other change in market condition we determine the fair value of equity index put option contract using black scholes based option valuation model input to the model include the current index value strike price interest rate dividend rate and contract expiration date the weighted average interest and dividend rate used of december were and respectively the interest rate were approximately basis point on weighted average basis over benchmark interest rate at the end of and represented our estimate of our nonperformance risk the black scholes based model also incorporates volatility input that estimate potential price change over time our contract have an average remaining maturity of about three year the weighted average volatility used of december wa approximately we determine the weighted average volatility based on the volatility input for each contract weighted by the contract notional value the potential impact from change in our volatility assumption are follows dollar in million fair value at december hypothetical change in volatility hypothetical fair value increase percentage point increase percentage point decrease percentage point decrease percentage point table of content management discussion and analysis continued other critical accounting policy our consolidated balance sheet at december included goodwill of acquired business of billion we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of our review includes determining the estimated fair value of our reporting unit there are several method of estimating reporting unit fair value including market quotation underlying asset and liability fair value determination and other valuation technique such discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flow and multiple of earnings we primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow method the key assumption and input used in such method may include forecasting revenue and expense operating cash flow and capital expenditure well an appropriate discount rate and other input significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment test due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flow and earnings actual result may vary significantly from the forecast if the carrying amount of reporting unit including goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value then required by gaap we estimate the fair value of the identifiable asset and liability of the reporting unit the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of it net asset establishes the implied value of goodwill the excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied goodwill value is charged to earnings an impairment loss market risk disclosure our consolidated balance sheet include substantial amount of asset and liability whose fair value are subject to market risk our significant market risk are primarily associated with equity price interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price the fair value of our investment portfolio and equity index put option contract remain subject to considerable volatility the following section address the significant market risk associated with our business activity equity price risk equity security represent significant portion of our investment portfolio strategically we strive to invest in business that posse excellent economics and able and honest management and we prefer to invest meaningful amount in each investee consequently equity investment are concentrated in relatively few issuer at december approximately of the total fair value of equity security wa concentrated in five issuer we often hold our equity investment for long period and short term price volatility ha occurred in the past and will occur in the future we strive to maintain significant level of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide margin of safety against short term price volatility we are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contract while our ultimate liability with respect to these contract is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date fair value of these contract are also affected by change in other factor such interest rate expected dividend rate and the remaining duration of the contract the following table summarizes our equity security and derivative contract liability with significant equity price risk of december and and the estimated effect of hypothetical increase and decrease in market price of those date the selected hypothetical increase and decrease doe not reflect the best or worst case scenario indeed result from decline

credit loss may occur we also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operation business acquisition and for other general purpose we strive to maintain high credit rating in order to minimize the cost of our debt we rarely utilize derivative product such interest rate swap to manage interest rate risk the fair value of our fixed maturity investment loan and finance receivables and note payable and other borrowing will fluctuate in response to change in market interest rate in addition change in interest rate assumption used in our equity index put option contract model cause change in reported liability with respect to those contract increase and decrease in interest rate generally translate into decrease and increase in fair value of these instrument

when an investor posse more than of the voting interest of the investee this presumption may be overcome based on specific fact and circumstance that demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is restricted we apply the equity method to investment in common stock and to other investment when such other investment posse substantially identical subordinated interest to common stock in applying the equity method we record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings

quotation asset and liability fair value and other valuation technique including but not limited to discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flow and multiple of earnings if the carrying amount of reporting unit including goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value then the identifiable asset and liability of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value of the current testing date the

investment be measured at fair value with change in fair value recognized in net earnings under existing gaap change in fair value of available for sale equity security are recorded in other comprehensive income given the magnitude of our investment in equity security and the inherent volatility of price for equity security the adoption of asu will have significant impact on our future reported net earnings although it will not affect our comprehensive income or total shareholder equity we adopted asu of january of that date we reclassified the accumulated net unrealized appreciation relating to our investment in equity security at december approximately billion from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings the fasb issued asu revenue from contract with customer in asu applies to contract with customer excluding most notably insurance reinsurance and leasing contract subsequently the fasb issued additional guidance that modified or clarified asu all guidance is collectively referred to accounting standard codification asc the framework prescribed by asc includes five step process for recognizing revenue core principle is that revenue are recognized the control of distinct good or service are transferred to customer in amount that reflect the consideration the seller expects to be entitled under asc revenue and related cost with respect to certain of our contract with customer will be recognized over time rather than when the product or service are delivered in addition certain of our contract will be treated lease for accounting purpose rather than contract with customer subject to asc we adopted asc of january under the modified retrospective method the principal impact of the initial adoption of asc resulted in an increase to both asset primarily property plant and equipment and liability of approximately billion in the fasb issued asu lease asu requires lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position liability to make lease payment and right of use asset representing it right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and also requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosure asu is effective for reporting period beginning after december with early adoption permitted we are currently evaluating the effect this standard will have on our consolidated financial

to be classified provisional and subject to remeasurement for up to one year from the enactment date for such element when the accounting effect is not complete but can be reasonably estimated we consider our estimate of the tax on accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiary to be provisional and subject to remeasurement when we obtain the necessary additional information to complete the accounting while we believe our estimate to be reasonable it will take additional time to validate the input to the foreign earnings and profit calculation the basis on which the repatriation tax is determined and the applicable state will address the repatriation tax we currently expect that our accounting for the repatriation tax under the tcja will be completed by the end of we have not established deferred income tax on accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiary which are expected to be reinvested indefinitely repatriation of all accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiary would be impracticable to the extent that such earnings represent capital to support normal business operation although no federal tax will be imposed on future

would impact the effective tax rate the remaining balance in net unrecognized tax benefit principally relates to tax position where the ultimate recognition is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of such recognition because of the impact of deferred income tax accounting the difference in recognition period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period of december we do not expect any material change to the estimated amount of unrecognized tax benefit in the next twelve month dividend
