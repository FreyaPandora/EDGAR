portfolio outside the company operated store base including our increased focus on international licensed store starbucks and tazo branded keurig cup portion pack coffee and tea starbucks via ready brew and the seattle best coffee brand focusing on relevant product innovation and profitable new growth platform accelerating the growth of our global consumer product business now that we have transitioned from our distribution arrangement with kraft food global inc balancing disciplined global store growth meeting target store level unit economics in given market and executing multi channel advertising and marketing campaign to effectively communicate our message directly to starbucks consumer and employee we face intense competition in each of our channel and market which could lead to reduced profitability the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive including with respect to product quality service convenience and price and we face significant competition in each of our channel and market accordingly we do not have leadership position in all channel and market in the the ongoing focus by large competitor in the quick service restaurant sector on selling high quality specialty coffee beverage could adversely affect our sale and result of operation similarly continued competition from well established competitor in our international market could hinder growth and adversely affect our sale and result of operation in those market increased competition in the packaged coffee and tea and ready to drink coffee beverage market could adversely affect the profitability of the cpg segment we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our operating segment our financial performance is highly dependent on our operating segment it comprised approximately two third of consolidated total net revenue in fiscal if revenue trend slow or decline our business and financial result could be adversely affected and the segment is relatively mature and produce the large majority of our operating cash flow could result in reduced cash flow for funding the expansion of our international business and for returning cash to shareholder we are increasingly dependent on the success of our international operation in order to achieve our growth target our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of our international operation some or all of our international market business unit mbus which we generally define by the country in which they operate may not be successful in their operation or in achieving expected growth which ultimately requires achieving consistent stable net revenue and earnings the performance of our international operation may be adversely affected by economic downturn in one or more of our large mbus in particular our canada japan uk and china mbus account for significant portion of the net revenue and earnings of our international operation and decline in the performance of any of these mbus could have material adverse impact on the result of our international operation additionally some factor that will be critical to the success of international mbus are different than those affecting our store and licensee taste naturally vary by region and consumer in some international market may not table of content embrace our product to the extent consumer in our market or other international market occupancy cost and store operating expense can be higher internationally than in the due to higher rent for prime store location or cost of compliance with country specific regulatory requirement because many of our international operation are in an early phase of development operating expense percentage of related revenue are often higher compared to operation additionally our international joint venture partner or licensee may face capital constraint or other factor that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in certain market our international operation are also subject to additional inherent risk of conducting business abroad such foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation change or uncertainty in economic legal regulatory social and political condition in our market interpretation and application of law and regulation restrictive action of foreign or governmental authority affecting trade and foreign investment including protective measure such export and custom duty and tariff government intervention favoring local competitor and restriction on the level of foreign ownership import or other business licensing requirement the enforceability of intellectual property and contract right limitation on the repatriation of fund and foreign currency exchange restriction due to current or new and international regulation in developing economy the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving targeted level of disposable income may not be fast we forecast difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operation and supply chain logistics including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service due to distance language and cultural difference local law that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with retain or terminate employee and delay in store opening for reason beyond our control competition with locally relevant competitor or lack of desirable real estate location available for lease at reasonable rate any of which could keep from meeting annual store opening target and in turn negatively impact net revenue operating income and earnings per share moreover many of the foregoing risk are particularly acute in developing country which are important to our long term growth prospect increase in the cost of high quality arabica coffee bean or other commodity or decrease in the availability of high quality arabica coffee bean or other commodity could have an adverse impact on our business and financial result we purchase roast and sell high quality whole bean arabica coffee bean and related coffee product the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility and over the last two year the base coffee commodity price ha increased markedly the high quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on negotiated basis at premium above the price this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly increase in the coffee commodity price do increase the price of high quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed price purchase commitment the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factor in the producing country including weather natural disaster and political and economic condition well the action of certain organization and association that have historically attempted to influence price of green coffee through agreement establishing export quota or by restricting coffee supply speculative trading in coffee commodity can also influence coffee price because of the significance of coffee bean to our operation combined with our ability to only partially table of content mitigate future price risk through purchasing practice and hedging activity increase in the cost of high quality arabica coffee bean could have an adverse impact on our profitability in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantity of green coffee due to any of the above factor or to worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have an adverse impact on our profitability in addition to coffee we also purchase significant amount of dairy product particularly fluid milk to support the need of our company operated retail store although le material to our operation than coffee or dairy other commodity including but not limited to those related to food input and energy are important to our operation increase in the cost of dairy product and other commodity could have an adverse impact on our profitability our success depends substantially on the value of our brand we believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our product for delivery of consistently positive consumer experience and for our corporate social responsibility program the starbucks brand ha been highly rated in several global brand value study to be successful in the future particularly outside of where the starbucks brand and our other brand are le well known we believe we must preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand across all sale channel brand value is based in part on consumer perception on variety of subjective quality even isolated business incident that erode consumer trust such contaminated food or privacy breach particularly if the incident receive considerable publicity or result in litigation can significantly reduce brand value consumer demand for our product and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we or our licensee fail to preserve the quality of our product are perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner or fail to deliver consistently positive consumer experience in each of our market our business depends in large part on the success of our business partner and supplier and our brand and reputation may be harmed by action taken by third party that are outside of our control our business strategy including our plan for new store foodservice branded product and other initiative relies significantly on variety of business partner and licensee and partnership relationship particularly in our international market licensee are often authorized to use our logo and provide branded beverage food and other product directly to customer we provide training and support to and monitor the operation of these business partner but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factor beyond our control including financial pressure we believe customer expect the same quality of product and service from our licensee they do from and we strive to ensure customer have the same experience whether they visit company operated or licensed store any shortcoming of starbucks business partner particularly an issue affecting the quality of the service experience the safety of beverage or food or compliance with law and regulation may be attributed by customer to thus damaging our reputation and brand value and potentially affecting our result of operation our food and beverage product are sourced from wide variety of domestic and international business partner in our supply chain operation we rely on these supplier and vendor to provide high quality product and to comply with applicable law our ability to find qualified supplier and vendor who meet our standard and supply product in timely and efficient manner is significant challenge especially with respect to good sourced from outside the vendor or supplier failure to meet our standard provide product in timely and efficient manner and comply with applicable law is beyond our control these issue could negatively impact our business and profitability failure to meet market expectation for our financial performance will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock failure to meet market expectation going forward particularly with respect to operating margin earnings per share comparable store sale operating cash flow and net revenue will likely result in decline and or increased volatility in the market price of our stock in addition price and volume fluctuation in the stock market whole may affect the market price of our stock in way that may be unrelated to our financial performance table of content the loss of key personnel or difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could adversely impact our business and financial

attributable to an increase in inventory resulting in part from higher coffee price partially offset by higher net earnings for the period and an increase in payable primarily related to green coffee

financial risk management market risk is defined the risk of loss due to change in commodity price foreign currency exchange rate equity security price and interest rate we manage our exposure to various market based risk according to an umbrella risk management policy under this policy market based risk are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategy such entering into hedging transaction the umbrella risk management policy governs the hedging instrument the business may use and limit the risk to net earnings we also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk additionally this policy restricts among other thing the amount of market based risk we will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategy and prohibits speculative trading activity in general hedging instrument do not have maturity in excess of five year the sensitivity analysis disclosed below provide only limited point in time view of the market risk of the financial instrument discussed the actual impact of the respective underlying rate and price change on the financial instrument may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analysis commodity price risk we purchase commodity input including coffee dairy product and diesel that are used in our operation and are subject to price fluctuation that impact our financial result in addition to fixed price and price to be fixed contract for coffee purchase we have entered into commodity hedge to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instrument we performed sensitivity analysis based on change in the underlying commodity price of our commodity hedge of october and determined that such change would not have significant impact on the fair value of these instrument foreign currency exchange risk the majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activity are transacted in dollar however because portion of our operation consists of activity outside of the we have transaction in other currency primarily the canadian dollar british pound euro and japanese yen result we may engage in transaction involving various derivative instrument to hedge revenue inventory purchase asset and liability denominated in foreign currency of october we had forward foreign exchange contract that hedge portion of anticipated international revenue stream and inventory

security we performed sensitivity analysis based on basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available for sale security of october and determined that such change would not have significant impact on the fair value of these instrument application of critical accounting policy critical accounting policy are those that management belief are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and result and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgment often result of the need to make estimate about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain judgment and uncertainty affecting the application of those policy may result in materially different amount being reported under different condition or using different assumption table of content we consider financial reporting and disclosure practice and accounting policy quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment we believe that of our significant accounting policy the following policy involve higher degree of judgment and or complexity asset impairment when fact and circumstance indicate that the carrying value of long lived asset may not be recoverable we evaluate long lived asset for impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the estimated future cash flow are le than the carrying value of the asset we measure an impairment loss based on the asset estimated fair value for retail asset the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level the fair value of store asset is estimated using discounted cash flow model based on internal projection key assumption used in this calculation include revenue growth operating expense and discount rate that we believe buyer would assume when determining purchase price for the store estimate of revenue growth and operating expense are based on internal projection and consider store historical performance local market economics and the business environment impacting the store performance these estimate are subjective and can be significantly impacted by change in the business or economic condition for non retail asset fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant fact and circumstance which may include discounted cash flow comparable transaction or comparable company analysis our impairment loss calculation contain uncertainty because they require management to make assumption and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flow and asset fair value including forecasting asset useful life further our ability to realize undiscounted cash flow in excess of the carrying value of our asset is affected by factor such the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the asset change in economic condition and change in operating performance during the past three fiscal year we have not made any material change in the accounting methodology that we use to ass long lived asset impairment loss for the foreseeable future we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in the estimate or assumption that we use to calculate long lived asset impairment loss however we periodically reassess estimated future cash flow and asset fair value change in our estimate and assumption may cause to realize material impairment charge in the future goodwill impairment we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if circumstance such material deterioration in performance or significant number of store closure indicate reporting unit carrying value may exceed their fair value if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value the fair value of our reporting unit is the price willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is typically calculated using discounted cash flow model key assumption used in this calculation include revenue growth operating expense and discount rate that we believe buyer would assume when determining purchase price for the reporting unit estimate of revenue growth and operating expense are based on internal projection considering reporting unit past performance and forecasted growth local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit performance the discount rate is calculated using an estimated cost of capital for retail operator to operate the reporting unit in the region these estimate are highly subjective judgment and can be significantly impacted by change in the business or economic condition our impairment loss calculation contain uncertainty because they require management to make assumption and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit including estimating future cash flow and if necessary the fair value of reporting unit asset and liability further our ability to realize the future cash flow used in our fair value calculation is affected by factor such change in economic condition change in our operating performance and change in our business strategy table of content part of our ongoing operation we may close certain store within reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease among other reason we abandon certain asset associated with closed store including leasehold improvement and other non transferrable asset under gaap when portion of reporting unit that constitutes business is to be disposed of goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal our evaluation of whether the portion of reporting unit being disposed of constitutes business occurs on the date of abandonment although an operating store meet the accounting definition of business prior to abandonment it doe not constitute business on the closure date because the remaining asset on that date do not constitute an integrated set of asset that are capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing return to investor result when closing individual store we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related asset noted above if store closure are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closure occur during the past three fiscal year we have not made any material change in the accounting methodology that we use to ass goodwill impairment loss for fiscal we determined the fair value of our reporting unit wa substantially in excess of their carrying value accordingly we did not recognize any goodwill impairment during the current fiscal year we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in the estimate or assumption that we use to test for impairment loss on goodwill in the foreseeable future however we periodically reassess our fair value calculation including estimated future cash flow change in our estimate and assumption may cause to realize material impairment charge in the future stock based compensation we measure the fair value of stock award at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the expense over the related service period for stock option award we use the black scholes merton option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumption these assumption include estimating the length of time employee will retain their stock option before exercising them expected term the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the expected dividend yield in addition we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those stock award expected to vest we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience change in our assumption could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in the estimate or assumption that we use to calculate stock based compensation expense for the foreseeable future however if actual result are not consistent with our estimate or assumption we may be exposed to change in stock based compensation expense that could be material in the future for fiscal change in our critical assumption including volatility and expected term would have changed stock based compensation expense by approximately million for fiscal operating lease we lease retail store roasting and distribution facility and office space under operating lease we provide for an estimate of our asset retirement obligation aro at the lease inception date for operating lease with requirement to remove leasehold improvement at the end of the lease term our estimate of aros involve assumption regarding both the amount and timing of actual future retirement cost the initial aro asset and liability represent the present value of the estimated future cost to complete the required work the aro asset is depreciated over the same timeframe the associate leasehold improvement and the liability is accreted over time future actual cost could differ significantly from amount initially estimated we occasionally vacate store and other location prior to the expiration of the related lease for vacated location with remaining lease commitment we record an expense for the difference between the present value of our future lease payment and related cost real estate tax and common area maintenance from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease term net of expected future sublease rental income key assumption in our table of content estimate of future cash flow include estimated sublease income and lease termination cost these estimate are based on historical experience our analysis of the specific real estate market including input from independent real estate firm and economic condition that can be difficult to predict cash flow are discounted using rate that coincides with the remaining lease term the liability recorded for location closure contains uncertainty because management is required to make assumption and to apply judgment to estimate the duration of future vacancy period the amount and timing of future settlement payment and the amount and timing of potential sublease rental income during the past three fiscal year we have not made any material change in the accounting methodology that we use to calculate our lease abandonment accrual for the foreseeable future we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in the estimate or assumption that we use to calculate our lease abandonment accrual however if actual result are not consistent with our estimate or assumption we may be exposed to loss or gain that could be material change in our key assumption for our lease abandonment accrual at october would not have had significant impact on net earnings for fiscal self insurance reserve we use combination of insurance and self insurance mechanism including wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in reinsurance treaty to provide for the potential liability for certain risk including worker compensation healthcare benefit general liability property insurance and director and officer liability insurance key assumption used in the estimate of our self insurance reserve include the amount of claim incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date these liability which are associated with the risk that are retained by starbucks are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claim experience demographic exposure and severity factor and other actuarial assumption the estimated accrual for these liability could be significantly affected if future occurrence and claim differ from these assumption and historical trend our self insured liability contain uncertainty because management is required to make assumption and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claim and claim incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date periodically we review our assumption to determine the adequacy of our self insured liability during the past three fiscal year we have not made any material change in the accounting methodology that we use to calculate our self insurance liability we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in the estimate or assumption that we use to calculate our self insurance liability for the foreseeable future however if actual result are not consistent with our estimate or assumption we may be exposed to loss or gain that could be material change in our self insurance reserve at october would have affected net earnings by approximately million in fiscal income tax we recognize deferred tax asset and liability based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amount and the respective tax base of our asset and liability deferred tax asset and liability are measured using current enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which we expect the temporary difference to reverse we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax asset and may record valuation allowance if based on all available evidence we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized in addition our income tax return are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authority these audit include question regarding our tax filing position including the timing and amount of deduction taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdiction we evaluate our exposure associated with our various tax filing position and record related liability we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefit and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitation expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available table of content deferred tax asset valuation allowance and our liability for unrecognized tax benefit require significant management judgment regarding applicable statute and their related interpretation the status of various income tax audit and our particular fact and circumstance although we believe that the judgment and estimate discussed herein are reasonable actual result could differ and we may be exposed to loss or gain that could be material to the extent we prevail in matter for which liability ha been established or are required to pay amount in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in given financial statement period could be materially affected litigation accrual we are involved in various claim and legal action that arise in the ordinary course of business legal and other contingency reserve and related disclosure are based on our assessment of the likelihood of potential loss and our ability to estimate the loss or range of loss which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisor we record reserve related to legal matter when it is probable that loss ha been incurred and the range of such loss can be reasonably estimated such assessment are reviewed each period and revised based on current fact and circumstance and historical experience with similar claim necessary our disclosure of and accrual for litigation claim if any contain uncertainty because management is required to use judgment to estimate the probability of loss and range of possible loss related to each claim footnote to the consolidated financial statement describes the company legal and other contingent liability matter we periodically review our assessment of litigation accrual we may change our assumption with respect to loss probability and range of potential loss any change in these assumption could have material impact on our future result of operation
