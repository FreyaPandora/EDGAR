in table of content fuel the following graph for our transportation segment show our average cost of jet and vehicle fuel per gallon for the year ended may fuel expense decreased during primarily due to lower aircraft fuel price however fuel price represent only one component of the two factor we consider meaningful in understanding the impact of fuel on our business consideration must also be given to the fuel surcharge revenue we collect accordingly we believe discussion of the net impact of fuel on our result which is comparison of the year over year change in these two factor is important to understand the impact of fuel on our business in order to provide information about the impact of fuel surcharge on the trend in revenue and yield growth we have included the comparative weighted average fuel surcharge percentage in effect for and in the accompanying discussion of each of our transportation segment the index used to determine the fuel surcharge percentage for our fedex freight business adjusts weekly while our fuel surcharge for the fedex express and fedex ground business incorporate timing lag of approximately six to eight week before they are adjusted for change in fuel price for example the fuel surcharge index in effect at fedex express in may wa set based on march fuel price in addition the structure of the table that is used to determine our fuel surcharge at fedex express and fedex ground doe not adjust immediately for change in fuel price but allows for the fuel surcharge revenue charged to our customer to remain unchanged long fuel price remain within certain range beyond these factor the manner in which we purchase fuel also influence the net impact of fuel on our result for example our contract for jet fuel purchase at fedex express are tied to various index including the gulf coast index while many of these index are aligned each index may fluctuate at different pace driving variability in the price paid for jet fuel furthermore under these contractual arrangement approximately of our jet fuel is purchased based on the index price for the preceding week with the remainder of our purchase tied to the index price for the preceding month rather than based on daily spot rate these contractual provision mitigate the impact of rapidly changing daily spot rate on our jet fuel purchase because of the factor described above our operating result may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by significant amount or change by amount that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharge which can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short term we routinely review our fuel surcharge and our fuel surcharge methodology on november we updated the table used to determine our fuel surcharge at fedex express fedex ground and fedex freight table of content the net impact of fuel had modest benefit to operating income in this wa driven by decreased fuel price during versus the prior year which wa partially offset by the year over year decrease in fuel surcharge revenue during these period the net impact of fuel on our operating result doe not consider the effect that fuel surcharge level may have on our business including change in demand and shift in the mix of service purchased by our customer while fluctuation in fuel surcharge percentage can be significant from period to period fuel surcharge represent one of the many individual component of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield additional component include the mix of service sold the base price and extra service charge we obtain for these service and the level of pricing discount offered fuel expense decreased during primarily due to lower aircraft fuel price the net impact of fuel had significant benefit to operating income in this wa driven by decreased fuel price during versus the prior year which wa slightly offset by the year over year decrease in fuel surcharge revenue during these period interest expense interest expense increased million in primarily due to increased interest expense from our and debt offering used to fund our share repurchase program and business acquisition interest expense increased million in primarily due to increased interest expense from our january debt offering and january debt offering income tax our effective tax rate wa in in and in due to it effect on income before income tax the adjustment for mtm accounting reduced our effective tax rate by basis point and our effective tax rate by basis point and increased our effective tax rate by basis point in our tax rate wa favorably impacted by million from an internal corporate restructuring done in anticipation of the integration of the foreign operation of fedex express and tnt express part of this restructuring our canadian subsidiary made distribution to our operation which resulted in the recognition of foreign tax credit in excess of the tax incurred from the distribution this favorable impact wa partially offset by million tax expense attributable to non deductible expense incurred part of the tnt express acquisition our permanent reinvestment strategy with respect to unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiary provided benefit of approximately million to our provision for income tax cumulative permanently reinvested foreign earnings were billion at the end of and billion at the end of the reduction in our permanently reinvested earnings wa due to the internal corporate restructuring discussed above additional information on income tax including our effective tax rate reconciliation liability for uncertain tax position and our global tax profile can be found in note of the accompanying

this program which were related primarily to employee severance were made at the time of departure and totaled approximately million in in we continued to make progress in achieving our profit improvement goal fedex express improved operating income by approximately from with essentially flat revenue during the three year period fedex service reduced it total expense while investing in major information technology transformation project we exited having achieved our profit improvement goal with run rate of billion of additional operating profit from the then base business fedex express ha improved operating income by approximately from despite lower fuel surcharge and unfavorable exchange rate driving flat to declining revenue during the four year period fedex service ha reduced table of content it total expense while investing in major information technology transformation project in addition our incentive compensation program have been gradually reinstated so that business plan objective will represent more fully funded compensation target while this program is completed assuming continued modest growth in the and global economy profitability and productivity are expected to continue to increase for year to come we further leverage the benefit of these initiative and fully integrate our recent business acquisition outlook during we expect improvement in the performance of all our transportation segment to drive revenue and earnings growth excluding any year end mtm adjustment and tnt express financial result integration expense and financing cost although our profit improvement program noted above are completed we expect these program to continue to constrain expense growth while improving revenue quality during segment level pension expense for is expected to be comparable to level continued moderate global economic growth is anticipated to drive volume and yield improvement our expectation for earnings growth in are dependent on key external factor including fuel price and global economic condition due to our recent acquisition of tnt express will be year of intensive integration activity and investment however the timing and amount of integration activity and cost will be subject to change information is validated and integration and operating plan are refined while integration planning team have been working for month to prepare for post closing activity up may we were competitor with tnt express and therefore access to key customer financial and operational data wa limited under competition law and regulation furthermore tnt express is undergoing large restructuring and turnaround program called outlook which includes incurring certain restructuring charge in result we anticipate tnt express will not be accretive to earnings until longer term we anticipate this transaction will generate substantial improvement in revenue and earnings and reduce our effective tax rate due to increased international earnings our capital expenditure for are expected to approximate billion largely for continued expansion of the fedex ground network and additional aircraft delivery in to support our fleet modernization program at fedex express this capital expenditure forecast includes tnt express we will continue to evaluate our investment in critical long term strategic project to ensure our capital expenditure generate high return on investment and are balanced with our outlook for global economic condition for additional detail on key capital project refer to the capital resource and liquidity outlook section of this md our outlook is dependent upon stable pricing environment for fuel volatility in fuel price impact our fuel surcharge level fuel expense and demand for our service volatility in fuel cost may impact earnings because adjustment to our fuel surcharge lag change in actual fuel price paid therefore the trailing impact of adjustment to our fuel surcharge can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short term in the third quarter of fedex ground announced plan to implement the independent service provider isp model throughout it entire pickup and delivery network to date service provider in state are operating under or transitioning to the isp model the transition to the isp model in the remaining state is expected to be completed by the cost associated with these transition will be recognized in the quarter incurred and are not expected to be material see risk factor for discussion of these and other potential risk and uncertainty that could materially affect our future performance seasonality of business our business are cyclical in nature seasonal fluctuation affect volume revenue and earnings historically the express package business experience an increase in volume in late november and december international business particularly in the asia to market peak in october and november in advance of the holiday sale season our first and third fiscal quarter table of content because they are summer vacation and post winter holiday season have historically experienced lower volume relative to other period normally the fall is the busiest shipping period for fedex ground while late december june and july are the slowest period for fedex freight the spring and fall are the busiest period and the latter part of december through february is the slowest period for fedex office the summer month are normally the slowest period shipment level operating cost and earnings for each of our company can also be adversely affected by inclement weather particularly the impact of severe winter weather in our third fiscal quarter recent accounting guidance new accounting rule and disclosure requirement can significantly impact our reported result and the comparability of our financial statement in the second quarter of we chose to early adopt the authoritative guidance issued by the financial accounting standard board fasb requiring acquirer in business combination to recognize adjustment to provisional amount that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period that the adjustment amount are determined and eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for these adjustment it also requires additional disclosure about the effect of the adjustment on prior period adoption of this guidance had no impact on our financial reporting see the business acquisition section above for further discussion regarding our recent business acquisition on may the fasb and international accounting standard board issued new accounting standard that will supersede virtually all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principle in the united state and international financial reporting standard which ha been subsequently updated to defer the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year this standard will be effective for beginning in fiscal the fundamental principle of the new guidance are that company should recognize revenue in manner that reflects the timing of the transfer of service to customer and the amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that company expects to receive for the good and service provided the new guidance establishes five step approach for the recognition of revenue based on our preliminary assessment we do not anticipate that the new guidance will have material impact on our revenue recognition policy practice or system on february the fasb issued the new lease accounting standard which requires lessee to put most lease on their balance sheet but recognize the expense on their income statement in manner similar to current practice the new standard state that lessee will recognize lease liability for the obligation to make lease payment and right of use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term expense related to lease determined to be operating lease will be recognized on straight line basis while those determined to be financing lease will be recognized following front loaded expense profile in which interest and amortization are presented separately in the income statement we are currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on our financial reporting but recognizing the lease liability and related right of use asset will significantly impact our balance sheet these change will be effective for our fiscal year beginning june fiscal with modified retrospective adoption method to the beginning of on november the fasb issued an accounting standard update that will require company to classify all deferred tax asset and liability noncurrent on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred tax into current and noncurrent amount this new guidance had minimal impact on our accounting and financial reporting and we chose to early adopt on retrospective basis in the fourth quarter of in may the fasb issued an accounting standard update that remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy investment for which fair value are estimated using the net asset value practical expedient provided by accounting standard codification fair value measurement this new guidance is effective for entity for fiscal year beginning after december with retrospective application to all period presented we elected to early adopt this standard which impacted our fair value disclosure related to retirement benefit plan investment in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement but not otherwise impact our financial statement in march the fasb issued an accounting standard update to simplify the accounting for share based payment transaction the new guidance requires company to recognize the income tax effect of award that vest or are settled income tax expense or benefit in the income statement opposed to additional paid in capital is current practice the guidance also provides clarification of the presentation of certain component of share based award in the statement of cash flow additionally the guidance allows company to make policy election to account for forfeiture either upon occurrence or by estimating forfeiture we are currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on our financial reporting these change will be effective for our fiscal year beginning june fiscal table of content we believe that no other new accounting guidance wa adopted or issued during that is relevant to the reader of our financial statement reportable

an interim basis at the segment level we set our eroa at for all period presented which equal our consolidated eroa assumption in in fiscal year where the consolidated eroa is greater than that difference is reflected credit in elimination corporate and other fedex express group on may we acquired tnt express tnt express collect transport and delivers document parcel and freight on day

over year impact from severe winter weather the increase to operating income wa partially offset by higher network expansion cost we continued to invest heavily in our fedex ground and fedex smartpost business the decline in operating margin for is primarily attributable to network expansion cost and the inclusion of genco result including the incremental cost from genco salary and employee benefit increased driven by additional staffing to support volume growth volume growth and higher service provider rate drove purchased transportation expense to increase in other expense increased in primarily due to the addition of genco result and higher self insurance cost network expansion caused rental expense to increase in depreciation and amortization expense increased in due to network expansion and trailer purchase fedex ground segment outlook we expect fedex ground segment revenue and operating income to increase in driven by commerce volume growth and market share gain we also anticipate continued yield growth in due to yield management program continued growth in commerce ha led to higher volume of larger shipment that can not be processed in our automated sortation system therefore we are making investment to adjust our network to efficiently handle the larger package and we are adjusting our pricing to reflect the higher cost of handling these package however we anticipate fedex ground operating margin will be negatively impacted by higher operating cost in due to network expansion and other operational cost resulting from higher residential service volume

alternative policy or estimation technique that could be used we maintain thorough process to review the application of our accounting policy and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimate that are required to prepare the financial statement of complex global corporation however even under optimal circumstance estimate routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstance and new or better information the estimate discussed below include the financial statement element that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policy and are material to our financial statement management ha discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of director and with our independent registered public accounting firm retirement plan overview we sponsor program that provide retirement benefit to most of our employee these program include defined benefit pension plan defined contribution plan and postretirement healthcare plan and are described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement the rule for pension accounting are complex and can produce tremendous volatility in our result financial condition and liquidity table of content the tnt express acquisition added number of defined benefit pension plan to our retirement plan portfolio the net funded status of these defined benefit pension plan is included in our disclosure of may the completion of the purchase accounting process to identify and value all of the defined benefit arrangement under accounting principle generally accepted in the united state may result in adjustment to the funded status of such plan during we are required to record annual year end adjustment to our financial statement for the net funded status of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan the funded status of our plan also impact our liquidity however the cash funding rule operate under completely different set of assumption and standard than those used for financial reporting purpose result our actual cash funding requirement can differ materially from our reported funded status the salary and employee benefit caption of our consolidated income statement includes expense associated with service prior service and interest cost the eroa and settlement and curtailment our fourth

to market adjustment the component of the pre tax mark to market loss are follows in million actual versus expected return on asset discount rate change demographic assumption experience total mark to market loss the actual rate of return on our pension plan asset of wa lower than our expected return of primarily due to challenging environment for global equity and other risk seeking asset class the weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan declined from at may to at may the demographic assumption experience in reflects change in disability rate and an increase in the average retirement age for pension and other postemployment benefit plan the implementation of new mortality table in resulted in an increased participant life expectancy assumption which increased the overall projected benefit obligation by billion the weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan declined from at may to at may table of content the actual rate of return on our pension plan asset of exceeded our expected return of primarily due to favorable investment environment for global equity market the weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan decreased from at may to at may discount rate this is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payment that have been accrued to date the projected benefit obligation or pbo to their net present value and to determine the succeeding year ongoing pension expense prior to any year end mtm adjustment the discount rate is determined each year at the plan measurement date the discount rate at each measurement date wa follows measurement date discount rate we determine the discount rate with the assistance of actuary who calculate the yield on theoretical portfolio of high grade corporate bond rated aa or better in developing this theoretical portfolio we select bond that match cash flow to benefit payment limit our concentration by industry and issuer and apply screening criterion to ensure bond with call feature have low probability of being called to the extent scheduled bond proceeds exceed the estimated benefit payment in given period the calculation assumes those excess proceeds are reinvested at one year forward rate the discount rate assumption is highly sensitive for our largest pension plan at our may measurement date basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased our pbo by approximately billion and basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased our pbo by approximately billion with the adoption of mtm accounting the impact of change in the discount rate on pension expense is predominantly isolated to our fourth quarter mark to market adjustment one basis point change in the discount rate for our largest pension plan would have million effect on the fourth quarter mark to market adjustment but only net impact on segment level pension expense plan asset the expected average rate of return on plan asset is long term forward looking assumption it is required to be the expected future long term rate of earnings on plan asset our pension plan asset are invested primarily in publicly tradable security and our pension plan hold only minimal investment in fedex common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third party pension fund investment manager part of our strategy to manage pension cost and funded status volatility we follow liability driven investment strategy to better align plan asset with liability establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension asset is judgmental matter which we review on an annual basis and revise appropriate management considers the following factor in determining this assumption the duration of our pension plan liability which drive the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan asset the type of investment class in which we invest our pension plan asset and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment class to earn over time and the investment return we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the return we could expect if investment were made strictly in indexed fund table of content for consolidated pension expense we assumed expected long term rate of return on our pension plan asset in and in and we lowered our eroa assumption in we continued to implement our asset and liability management strategy in lowering this assumption we considered our historical return our current capital market outlook and our investment strategy for our plan asset including the impact of the duration of our liability our actual return in wa le than the expected return our actual return in and however exceeded those long term assumption our actual return on plan asset ha contracted from due to lower than expected return on public equity at the segment level we set our eroa at for all period presented when we adopted mtm accounting in we record service cost interest cost and eroa at the segment level but our annual mtm adjustment and any difference between our consolidated eroa and our segment eroa are reflected only at the corporate level this allows our segment operating result to follow internal management reporting which is used for making operating decision and assessing performance for our pension plan one basis point change in our eroa impact our segment pension expense by million the actual historical annual return on our

concerning the funded status of our pension plan of may in million funded status of plan projected benefit obligation pbo fair value of plan asset funded status of the plan cash amount cash contribution during the year benefit payment during the year funding the funding requirement for our pension plan are governed by the pension protection act of which ha aggressive funding requirement in order to avoid benefit payment restriction that become effective if the funded status determined under internal revenue service rule fall below at the beginning of plan year all of our pension plan have funded status level in excess of and our plan remain adequately funded to provide benefit to our employee they come due additionally current benefit payment do not materially impact our total plan asset benefit payment for our pension plan for were approximately million or of plan asset during required contribution to our pension plan were not significant over the past several year we have made voluntary contribution to our pension plan in excess of the minimum required contribution amount contributed in excess of the minimum required can result in credit balance for funding purpose that can be used to reduce minimum contribution requirement in future year our current credit balance exceeds billion at may for we anticipate making contribution to our pension plan totaling billion approximately million of which are required see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement for further information about our retirement plan table of content self insurance accrual we are self insured up to certain limit for cost associated with worker compensation claim vehicle accident and general business liability and benefit paid under employee healthcare and disability program our reserve are established for estimate of loss on reported claim including incurred but not reported claim self insurance accrual reflected in our balance sheet were billion at may and billion at may approximately of these accrual were classified current liability our self insurance accrual are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claim incurred of the balance sheet date these estimate include consideration of factor such severity of claim frequency and volume of claim healthcare inflation seasonality and plan design cost trend on material accrual are updated each quarter we self insure up to certain limit that vary by type of risk periodically we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance level based on risk tolerance and premium expense we believe the use of actuarial method to account for these liability provides consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accrual however the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claim involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known we believe our recorded obligation for these expense are consistently measured on conservative basis nevertheless change in healthcare cost accident frequency and severity insurance retention level and other factor can materially affect the estimate for these liability long lived asset useful life and salvage value our business is capital intensive with approximately of our total asset invested in our transportation and information system infrastructure the depreciation or amortization of our capital asset over their estimated useful life and the determination of any salvage value requires management to make judgment about future event because we utilize many of our capital asset over relatively long period the majority of aircraft cost are depreciated over to year we periodically evaluate whether adjustment to our estimated service life or salvage value are necessary to ensure these estimate properly match the economic use of the asset this evaluation may result in change in the estimated life and residual value used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment for our aircraft we typically assign no residual value due to the utilization of these asset in cargo configuration which result in little to no value at the end of their useful life these estimate affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in period and ultimately the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset change in the estimated life of asset will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future period and could have material impact on our result of operation described below historically gain and loss on disposal of operating equipment have not been material however such amount may differ materially in the future due to change in business level technological obsolescence accident frequency regulatory change and other factor beyond our control in fedex express made the decision to accelerate the retirement of aircraft and related engine to aid in our fleet modernization and improve our global network in we shortened the depreciable life for aircraft and related engine to accelerate the retirement of these aircraft resulting in depreciation expense increase of million in result of these accelerated retirement we incurred an additional million in year over year accelerated depreciation expense in impairment of may the fedex express global air and ground network includes fleet of aircraft including approximately supplemental aircraft that provide delivery of package and freight to more than country and territory through wide range of and international shipping service while certain aircraft are utilized in primary geographic area versus international we operate an integrated global network and utilize our aircraft and other mode of transportation to achieve the lowest cost of delivery while maintaining our service commitment to our customer because of the integrated nature of our global network our aircraft are interchangeable across route and geography giving flexibility with our fleet planning to meet changing global economic condition and maintain and modify aircraft needed table of content because of the lengthy lead time for aircraft manufacture and modification we must anticipate volume level and plan our fleet requirement year in advance and make commitment for aircraft based on those projection furthermore the timing and availability of certain used aircraft type particularly those with better fuel efficiency may create limited opportunity to acquire these aircraft at favorable price in advance of our capacity need these activity create risk that asset capacity may exceed demand aircraft purchase primarily aircraft in passenger configuration that have not been placed in service totaled million at may and million at may we plan to modify these asset in the future and place them into operation the accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with it estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the cash flow do not exceed the carrying value the asset must be adjusted to it current fair value we operate integrated transportation network and accordingly cash flow for most of our operating asset are assessed at network level not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment further decision about capital investment are evaluated based on the impact to the overall network rather than the return on an individual asset we make decision to remove certain long lived asset from service based on projection of reduced capacity need or lower operating cost of newer aircraft type and those decision may result in an impairment charge asset held for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair value le cost to sell when the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criterion are met the fair value determination for such aircraft may require management estimate there may not be active market for some of these aircraft such estimate are subject to revision from period to period in the normal management of our aircraft fleet we routinely idle aircraft and engine temporarily due to maintenance cycle and adjustment of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand level temporarily idled asset are classified available for use and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these asset these temporarily idled asset are assessed for impairment on quarterly basis the criterion for determining whether an asset ha been permanently removed from service and result is potentially impaired include but are not limited to our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume level including capacity need during our peak shipping season the introduction of new fleet type or decision to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operation and change to planned service expansion activity at may we had four aircraft temporarily idled these aircraft have been idled for le than one year and are expected to return to revenue service in the fourth quarter of we retired from service seven boeing aircraft and related engine four airbus aircraft and three related engine three airbus aircraft and three related engine and one boeing aircraft and three related engine and related part we also adjusted the retirement schedule of an additional aircraft and engine consequence impairment and related charge of million million net of tax or per diluted share of which million wa noncash were recorded in the fourth quarter the decision to permanently retire these aircraft and engine aligns with fedex express plan to rationalize capacity and modernize it aircraft fleet to more effectively serve it customer these combined retirement change will not have material impact on our near term depreciation expense lease we utilize operating lease to finance certain of our aircraft facility and equipment such arrangement typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the asset at the end of the lease period to the lessor disclosed in contractual cash obligation and note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement at may we had approximately billion on an undiscounted basis of future commitment for payment under operating lease the weighted average remaining lease term of all operating lease outstanding at may wa approximately six year the future commitment for operating lease are not yet reflected liability in our balance sheet until the new rule on lease accounting issued in become effective in our fiscal described below the determination of whether lease is accounted for capital lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimate primarily about the fair value of the asset and it estimated economic useful life in addition our evaluation includes ensuring we properly account for build to suit lease arrangement and making judgment about whether various form of lessee involvement during the construction period make the lessee an agent for the owner lessor or in substance the owner of the asset during the construction period we believe we have well defined and controlled process for making these evaluation including obtaining third party appraisal for material transaction to assist in making these evaluation table of content on february the fasb issued the new lease accounting standard which will require to record an asset and liability for our outstanding operating lease similar to the current accounting for capital lease notably the new standard state that lessee will recognize lease liability for the net present value of the obligation to make lease payment and right of use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term expense related to lease determined to be operating lease will be recognized on straight line basis while those determined to be financing lease will be recognized following front loaded expense profile in which interest and amortization are presented separately in the income statement under the new rule we believe that majority of our operating lease obligation reflected in the contractual cash obligation table would be required to be reflected in our balance sheet at their net present value these change will be effective for our fiscal year beginning june fiscal with modified retrospective adoption method to the beginning of goodwill of may we had billion of recorded goodwill from our business acquisition representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net asset we have acquired during we recorded billion in additional goodwill associated with our tnt express acquisition during we recorded billion in additional goodwill associated with our genco and fedex crossborder acquisition several factor give rise to goodwill in our acquisition such the expected benefit from synergy of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment in our evaluation of goodwill impairment we perform qualitative assessment that requires management judgment and the use of estimate to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive we proceed to two step process to test goodwill for impairment including comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying value including attributable goodwill fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodology principally the income or market approach incorporating market participant consideration and management assumption on revenue growth rate operating margin discount rate and expected capital expenditure estimate used by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test change in forecasted operating result and other assumption could materially affect these estimate we perform our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter unless circumstance indicate the need to accelerate the timing of the test our reporting unit with significant recorded goodwill include fedex express tnt express fedex ground fedex freight fedex office reported in the fedex service segment and genco reported in the fedex ground segment with the exception of tnt express due to the timing of the acquisition we evaluated these reporting unit during the fourth quarter of and the estimated fair value of each of these reporting unit exceeded their carrying value in and therefore we do not believe that any of these reporting unit were impaired of the balance sheet date contingency we are subject to various loss contingency including tax proceeding and litigation in connection with our operation contingent liability are difficult to measure their measurement is subject to multiple factor that are not easily predicted or projected further additional complexity in measuring these liability arises due to the various jurisdiction in which these matter occur which make our ability to predict their outcome highly uncertain moreover different accounting rule must be employed to account for these item based on the nature of the contingency accordingly significant management judgment is required to ass these matter and to make determination about the measurement of liability if any our material pending loss contingency are described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement in the opinion of management the aggregate liability if any of individual matter or group of matter not specifically described in note is not expected to be material to our financial position result of operation or cash flow the following describes our method and associated process for evaluating these matter table of content tax contingency we are subject to income and operating tax rule of the it state and municipality and of the foreign jurisdiction in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining income tax provision well deferred tax asset and liability balance and related deferred tax valuation allowance if necessary due to the complexity of these rule and their interaction with one another we account for income tax by recording both current tax payable and deferred tax asset and liability our provision for income tax is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we operate applied to taxable income reduced by applicable tax credit tax contingency arise from uncertainty in the application of tax rule throughout the many jurisdiction in which we operate and are impacted by several factor including tax audit appeal litigation change in tax law and other rule and their interpretation and change in our business we regularly ass the potential impact of these factor for the current and prior year to determine the adequacy of our tax provision we continually evaluate the likelihood and amount of potential adjustment and adjust our tax position including the current and deferred tax liability in the period in which the fact that give rise to revision become known in addition management considers the advice of third party in making conclusion regarding tax consequence we recognize liability for uncertain income tax position based on two step process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any the second step requires to estimate and measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amount we must determine the probability of various possible outcome we reevaluate these uncertain tax position on quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management these reevaluation are based on factor including but not limited to change in fact or circumstance change in tax law successfully settled issue under audit and new audit activity such change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of tax benefit or an increase to the related provision we classify interest related to income tax liability interest expense and if applicable penalty are recognized component of income tax expense the income tax liability and accrued interest and penalty that are due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented current liability the remaining portion of our income tax liability and accrued interest and penalty are presented noncurrent liability because payment of cash is not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date these noncurrent income tax liability are recorded in the caption other liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet we account for operating tax based on multi state local and foreign taxing jurisdiction rule in those area in which we operate provision for operating tax are estimated based upon these rule asset acquisition and disposal historical spend and other variable these provision are consistently evaluated for reasonableness against compliance and risk factor we measure and record operating tax contingency accrual in accordance with accounting guidance for contingency discussed below this guidance requires an accrual of estimated loss from contingency such tax or other legal proceeding or claim when it is probable that loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated legal and other contingency because of the complex environment in which we operate we are subject to other legal proceeding and claim including those relating to general commercial matter governmental enforcement action employment related claim and fedex ground owner operator accounting guidance for contingency requires an accrual of estimated loss from contingency such tax or other legal proceeding or claim when it is probable the future event or event are likely to occur that loss ha been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated this guidance also requires disclosure of loss contingency matter when in management judgment material loss is reasonably possible or probable table of content during the preparation of our financial statement we evaluate our contingency to determine whether it is probable reasonably possible or remote that liability ha been incurred loss is recognized for all contingency deemed probable and estimable regardless of amount for unresolved contingency with potentially material exposure that are deemed reasonably possible we evaluate whether potential loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated our evaluation of these matter is the result of comprehensive process designed to ensure that accounting recognition of loss or disclosure of these contingency is made in timely manner and involves our legal and accounting personnel well external counsel where applicable the process includes regular communication during each quarter and scheduled meeting shortly before the completion of our financial statement to evaluate any new legal proceeding and the status of existing matter in determining whether loss should be accrued or loss contingency disclosed we evaluate among other factor the current status of each matter within the scope and context of the entire lawsuit or proceeding the lengthy and complex nature of class action matter the procedural status of each matter any opportunity to dispose of lawsuit on it merit before trial motion to dismiss or for summary judgment the amount of time remaining before trial date the status of discovery the status of settlement arbitration or mediation proceeding and our judgment regarding the likelihood of success prior to or at trial in reaching our conclusion with respect to accrual of loss or loss contingency disclosure we take holistic view of each matter based on these factor and the information available prior to the issuance of our financial statement uncertainty with respect to an individual factor or combination of these factor may impact our decision related to accrual or disclosure of loss contingency including conclusion that we are unable to establish an estimate of possible loss or meaningful range of possible loss we update our disclosure to reflect our most current understanding of the contingency at the time we issue our financial statement however event may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of contingency may result in loss to that differs materially from our previously estimated liability or range of possible loss despite the inherent complexity in the accounting and disclosure of contingency we believe that our process are robust and thorough and provide consistent framework for management in evaluating the potential outcome of contingency for proper accounting recognition and disclosure risk factor our financial and operating result are subject to many risk and uncertainty described below we are directly affected by the state of the economy while macro economic risk apply to most company we are particularly vulnerable the transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trend in economic activity our primary business is to transport good so our business level are directly tied to the purchase and production of good key macro economic measurement when individual and company purchase and produce fewer good we transport fewer good and company expand the number of distribution center and move manufacturing closer to consumer market we transport good shorter distance in addition we have relatively high fixed cost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume level moreover we continue to grow our international business we are increasingly affected by the health of the global economy the rate of growth of global trade and the typically more volatile economy of emerging market most recently the united kingdom table of content uk vote to leave the european union eu could result in economic uncertainty and instability resulting in fewer good being transported globally in we saw continued customer preference for slower le costly shipping service our business depend on our strong reputation and the value of the fedex brand the fedex brand name symbolizes high quality service reliability and speed fedex is one of the most widely recognized trusted and respected brand in the world and the fedex brand is one of our most important and valuable asset in addition we have strong reputation among customer and the general public for high standard of social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance and ethic the fedex brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sale and marketing tool and we devote significant resource to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activity by our employee contractor or agent such customer service mishap or noncompliance with law could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand with the increase in the use of social medium outlet such youtube and twitter adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly making it increasingly difficult for to effectively respond damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our service and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and result of operation well require additional resource to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand the failure to integrate successfully the business and operation of fedex express and tnt express in the expected time frame may adversely affect our future result prior to fedex acquisition of tnt express in may fedex express and tnt express operated independent company there can be no assurance that these business can be integrated successfully it is possible that the integration process could result in higher than expected integration cost the loss of customer the disruption of ongoing business unexpected integration issue or the loss of key historical fedex express or tnt express employee it is also possible that the overall post acquisition integration process will take longer than currently anticipated specifically the following issue among others must be addressed we begin to integrate the operation of fedex express and tnt express in order to realize the anticipated benefit of the transaction combining the company operation and corporate function combining the business of fedex express and tnt express and meeting the capital requirement of the combination in manner that permit to achieve the operating and financial result we anticipated from the acquisition the failure of which could result in the material anticipated benefit of the transaction not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all integrating and consolidating the company administrative and information technology infrastructure and computer system integrating workforce while continuing to provide consistent high quality service to customer integrating and unifying the offering and service available to historical fedex express and tnt express customer harmonizing the company operating practice employee development and compensation program integrity and compliance program internal control and other policy procedure and process integrating the company financial reporting and internal control system including our ability to become compliant with the requirement of section of the sarbanes oxley act of amended and the rule promulgated thereunder by the sec maintaining existing agreement with customer and service provider and avoiding delay in entering into new agreement with prospective customer and service provider table of content addressing possible difference in business background corporate culture and management philosophy addressing employee social issue so to maintain efficient and effective labor and employee relation coordinating rebranding and marketing effort managing the movement of certain position to different location managing potential unknown and unidentified liability including liability that are significantly larger than currently anticipated and unforeseen increased expense or delay associated with the integration process and managing the expanded operation of significantly larger more complex company all of these factor could dilute fedex earnings per share decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and negatively impact the price of fedex common stock in addition at time the attention of certain member of our management may be focused on the integration of the business of fedex express and tnt express and diverted from day to day business operation which may disrupt our business significant data breach or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could disrupt our operation and result in the loss of critical confidential information adversely impacting our reputation business or result of operation our ability to attract and retain customer and to compete effectively depends in part upon the sophistication and reliability of our technology network including our ability to provide feature of service that are important to our customer and to protect our confidential business information and the information provided by our customer we are subject to risk imposed by data breach particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion including by computer hacker foreign government and cyber terrorist data breach have increased in recent year the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attack and intrusion from around the world have increased additionally risk such code anomaly act of god transitional challenge in migrating operating company functionality to our fedex enterprise automation platform data leakage and human error pose direct threat to our product service and data any disruption to our complex global technology infrastructure including those impacting our computer system and fedex com could result in the loss of confidential business or customer information adversely impact our customer service volume and revenue or could lead to litigation or investigation resulting in significant cost these type of adverse impact could also occur in the event the confidentiality integrity or availability of company and customer information wa compromised due to data loss by fedex or trusted third party recently there ha also been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the and abroad particularly in the eu and failure to comply with applicable or foreign data protection regulation or other data protection standard may expose to litigation fine sanction or other penalty which could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business result of operation and financial condition we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiative information technology risk management and disaster recovery plan the development and maintenance of these measure is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating technology change and effort to overcome security measure become increasingly more sophisticated despite our effort we are not fully insulated from data breach technology disruption or data loss which could adversely impact our competitiveness and result of operation although we have not experienced data breach or other disruption to our technology infrastructure that are material either individually or in the aggregate we may be unable to detect or prevent material breach or disruption in the future our transportation business are impacted by the price and availability of fuel we must purchase large quantity of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicle and the price and availability of fuel can be unpredictable and beyond our control to date we have been mostly successful in mitigating over time the expense impact of higher fuel cost through our indexed fuel surcharge the table of content amount of the surcharge is closely linked to the market price for fuel if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharge because of competitive pricing pressure or some other reason fuel cost could adversely impact our operating result additionally if fuel price rise sharply even if we increase our fuel surcharge we could experience lag time in implementing the surcharge which could adversely affect our short term operating result even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharge high fuel surcharge could move our customer away from our higher yielding express service to our lower yielding deferred or ground service or even reduce customer demand for our service altogether in addition disruption in the supply of fuel could have negative impact on our ability to operate our transportation network our business are capital intensive and we must make capital decision based upon projected volume level we make significant investment in aircraft package handling facility vehicle technology sort equipment copy equipment and other asset to support our transportation and business network we also make significant investment to rebrand integrate and grow the company that we acquire the amount and timing of capital investment depend on various factor including our anticipated volume growth we must make commitment to purchase or modify aircraft year before the aircraft are actually needed we must predict volume level and fleet requirement and make commitment for aircraft based on those projection missing our projection could result in much or too little capacity relative to our shipping volume overcapacity could lead to asset disposition or write down and undercapacity could negatively impact service level we face intense competition the transportation and business service market are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service especially in period of little or no macro economic growth some of our competitor have more financial resource than we do or they are controlled or subsidized by foreign government which enables them to raise capital more easily we also compete with regional transportation provider that operate smaller and le capital intensive transportation network and startup that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market need in addition some high volume package shipper such amazon com are developing in house delivery capability which could in turn reduce our revenue and market share we believe we compete effectively with these company for example by providing more reliable service at compensatory price however an irrational pricing environment can limit our ability not only to maintain or increase our price including our fuel surcharge in response to rising fuel cost but also to maintain or grow our market share while we believe we compete effectively through our current service offering if our current competitor or potential future competitor offer broader range of service or more effectively bundle their service it could impede our ability to maintain or grow our market share moreover if our current customer such amazon com become competitor it will reduce our revenue and could negatively impact our financial condition and result of operation if we do not successfully execute or effectively operate integrate leverage and grow acquired business our financial result and reputation may suffer our strategy for long term growth productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to make prudent strategic acquisition and to realize the benefit we expect when we make those acquisition in furtherance of this strategy in addition to tnt express we have acquired business in europe latin america africa and the united state over the past several year while we expect our past and future acquisition to enhance our value proposition to customer and improve our long term profitability there can be no assurance that we will realize our expectation within the time frame we have established if at all or that we can continue to support the value we allocate to these acquired business including their goodwill or other intangible asset labor organization attempt to organize group of our employee from time to time and potential change in labor law could make it easier for them to do so if we are unable to continue to maintain good relationship with our employee and prevent labor organization from organizing group of our employee our operating cost could significantly increase and our operational flexibility could be significantly reduced despite continual organizing attempt by labor union other than the pilot of fedex express and driver at four fedex freight facility our employee have thus far chosen not to unionize we acquired genco in january which already had small number of employee that are member of union table of content the congress ha in the past considered adopting change in labor law however that would make it easier for union to organize unit of our employee for example there is always possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employee from the purview of the rla for additional discussion of the rla see part item of this annual report on form under the caption regulation such legislation could expose our customer to the type of service disruption that the rla wa designed to prevent local work stoppage in key area that interrupt the timely flow of shipment of time sensitive high value good throughout our global network such disruption could threaten our ability to provide competitively priced shipping option and ready access to global market there is also the possibility that congress could pas other labor legislation that could adversely affect our company such fedex ground and fedex freight whose employee are governed by the national labor relation act of amended nlra in addition federal and state governmental agency such the national labor relation board have and may continue to take action that could make it easier for our employee to organize under the rla or nlra finally change to federal or state law governing employee classification could impact the status of fedex ground owner operator independent employer of driver if fedex ground is deemed to be joint employer of independent contractor employee labor organization could more easily organize these individual our operating cost could increase materially and we could incur significant capital outlay fedex ground relies on owner operator to conduct it linehaul and pickup and delivery operation and the status of these owner operator independent contractor and direct employer of driver providing these service is being challenged fedex ground use of independent contractor is well suited to the need of the ground delivery business and it customer evidenced by the strong growth of this business segment we are involved in numerous lawsuit and state tax and other administrative proceeding that claim that the company owner operator under contractor model no longer in use should have been treated our employee rather than independent contractor or that driver employed by independent contractor should be treated our employee we incur certain cost including legal fee in defending the status of fedex ground owner operator independent contractor we believe that fedex ground owner operator are properly classified independent contractor and that fedex ground is not an employer of the driver of the company independent contractor however adverse determination in these matter could among other thing entitle certain of our owner operator and their driver to the reimbursement of certain expense and to the benefit of wage and hour law and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for fedex ground and could result in change to the independent contractor status of fedex ground owner operator change to state law governing the definition of independent contractor could also impact the status of fedex ground owner operator the uk vote to leave the eu could adversely impact our business result of operation and financial condition there is substantial uncertainty surrounding the uk june vote to leave the eu brexit any impact of the brexit vote depends on the term of the uk withdrawal from the eu which still need to be determined and could take several year to accomplish the uk withdrawal from the eu could result in global economic downturn which could depress the demand for our service the uk also could lose access to the single eu market and to the global trade deal negotiated by the eu on behalf of it member depressing trade between the uk and other country which would negatively impact our international operation additionally we may face new regulation regarding trade aviation security and employee among others in the uk compliance with such regulation could be costly negatively impacting our business result of operation and financial condition disruption or modification in service by the usps or change in it business could have an adverse effect on our operation and financial result the usps is significant customer and vendor of fedex in particular the usps is the largest customer of fedex express which provides domestic air transportation service for the usps first class priority and express mail and transportation and delivery for the usps international delivery service disruption or modification in service by the usps result of financial difficulty or change in it business including any structural change to it operation network service offering or pricing could adversely affect our operation negatively impacting our revenue and financial result table of content the transportation infrastructure continues to be target of terrorist activity because transportation asset continue to be target of terrorist activity government around the world are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirement that will increase operating cost and potentially slow service for business including those in the transportation industry for example the transportation security administration requires fedex express to comply with full all cargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains evolving and strict security requirement these requirement are not static but change periodically the result of regulatory and legislative requirement imposing additional security cost and creating level of uncertainty for our operation thus it is reasonably possible that these rule or other future security requirement could impose material cost on or slow our service to our customer moreover terrorist attack directed at fedex or other aspect of the transportation infrastructure could disrupt our operation and adversely impact demand for our service the regulatory environment for global aviation or other transportation right may impact our operation our extensive air network is critical to our success our right to serve foreign point is subject to the approval of the department of transportation and generally requires bilateral agreement between the united state and foreign government in addition we must obtain the permission of foreign government to provide specific flight and service our operation outside of the united state such fedex express growing international domestic operation are also subject to current and potential regulation including certain postal regulation and licensing requirement that restrict make difficult and sometimes prohibit the ability of foreign owned company such fedex express to compete effectively in part of the international domestic transportation and logistics market regulatory action affecting global aviation or transportation right or failure to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation right in important international market could impair our ability to operate our network we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market response to such change concern over climate change including the impact of global warming ha led to significant and international legislative and regulatory effort to limit greenhouse gas ghg emission including our aircraft and diesel engine emission for example in the environmental protection agency the epa issued proposed finding on ghg emission from aircraft and it relationship to air pollution the final finding is regulatory prerequisite to the epa adoption of new certification standard for aircraft emission additionally in the european commission approved the extension of the european union emission trading scheme ets for ghg emission to the airline industry under this decision all fedex express flight that are wholly within the european union are now covered by the ets requirement and each year we are required to submit emission allowance in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emission from such flight in addition the congress ha in the past considered bill that would regulate ghg emission and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future increased regulation regarding ghg emission especially aircraft or diesel engine emission could impose substantial cost on especially at fedex express these cost include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital cost associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicle prematurely until the timing scope and extent of such regulation becomes known we can not predict it effect on our cost structure or our operating result it is reasonably possible however that it could impose material cost on moreover even without such regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by company in the airline and transportation industry could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our service especially our air express service finally given the broad and global scope of our operation and our susceptibility to global macro economic trend we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risk of climate change that could affect all of humankind such shift in weather pattern and world ecosystem localized disaster in key geography could adversely impact our business while we operate several integrated network with asset distributed throughout the world there are concentration of key asset within our network that are exposed to adverse table of content weather condition or localized risk from natural or manmade disaster such tornado flood earthquake or terrorist attack the loss of key location such our memphis super hub or one of our information technology center could cause significant disruption to our operation and cause to incur significant cost to reestablish or relocate these function moreover resulting economic dislocation including supply chain and fuel disruption could adversely impact demand for our service we are also subject to other risk and uncertainty that affect many other business including increasing cost the volatility of cost and funding requirement and other legal mandate for employee benefit especially pension and healthcare benefit the increasing cost of compliance with federal state and foreign governmental agency mandate including the foreign corrupt practice act and the bribery act and defending against inappropriate or unjustified enforcement or other action by such agency the impact of any international conflict on the united state and global economy in general the transportation industry or in particular and effect these event will have on our cost or the demand for our service any impact on our business resulting from new domestic or international government law and regulation change in foreign currency exchange rate especially in the euro chinese yuan british pound brazilian real canadian dollar and the mexican peso which can affect our sale level and foreign currency sale price market acceptance of our new service and growth initiative any liability resulting from and the cost of defending against class action litigation such wage and hour joint employment and discrimination and retaliation claim and any other legal or governmental proceeding our ability to achieve the benefit of any ongoing or future profit improvement initiative the outcome of future negotiation to reach new collective bargaining agreement including with the union that represents the pilot of fedex express the current pilot agreement is scheduled to become amendable in november and with the union that wa elected in to represent driver at four fedex freight facility the impact of technology development on our operation and on demand for our service and our ability to continue to identify and eliminate unnecessary information technology redundancy and complexity throughout the organization governmental underinvestment in transportation infrastructure which could increase our cost and adversely impact our service level due to traffic congestion or sub optimal routing of our vehicle and aircraft

supply and fuel spare part principally aircraft related are reported at weighted average cost allowance for obsolescence are provided for spare part currently identified excess or obsolete well expected to be on hand at the date the aircraft are retired from service these allowance are provided over the estimated useful life of the related aircraft and engine the majority of our supply and our fuel are reported at weighted average cost property and equipment expenditure for major addition improvement and flight equipment modification are capitalized when such cost are determined to extend the useful life of the asset or are part of the cost of acquiring the asset expenditure for equipment overhaul cost of engine or airframe prior to their operational use are capitalized part of the cost of such asset they are cost required to ready the asset for it intended use maintenance and repair cost are charged to expense incurred except for certain aircraft engine maintenance cost incurred under third party service agreement these agreement resulted in cost being expensed based on cycle or hour flown and are subject to annual escalation these service contract transfer risk to third party service provider and generally fix the amount we pay for maintenance to the service provider rate per cycle or flight hour in exchange for maintenance and repair under predefined maintenance program we capitalize certain direct internal and external cost associated with the development of internal use software gain and loss on sale of property used in operation are classified within operating expense and historically have been nominal for financial reporting purpose we record depreciation and amortization of property and equipment on straight line basis over the asset service life or related lease term if shorter for income tax purpose depreciation is computed using accelerated method when applicable the depreciable life and net book value of our property and

ground support equipment to year vehicle to year computer and electronic equipment to year facility and other to year the fair value of tnt express property and equipment included in the table above at may wa billion given the timing of the tnt express acquisition this value is preliminary and likely to change during the purchase price allocation measurement period which end no later than the fourth quarter of table of content substantially all property and equipment have no material residual value the majority of aircraft cost are depreciated on straight line basis over to year we periodically evaluate the estimated service life and residual value used to depreciate our property and equipment in may we adjusted the depreciable life of aircraft and engine these change will not have material impact on near term depreciation expense in may fedex express made the decision to accelerate the retirement of aircraft and related engine to aid in our fleet modernization and improve our global network in we shortened the depreciable life for aircraft and related engine to accelerate the retirement of these aircraft result of these accelerated retirement we incurred an additional million in year over year accelerated depreciation expense in depreciation and amortization expense excluding gain and loss on sale of property and equipment used in operation wa billion in and depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of asset under capital lease capitalized interest interest on fund used to finance the acquisition and modification of aircraft including

the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable for asset that are to be held and used an impairment is recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flow associated with the asset or group of asset is le than their carrying value if impairment exists an adjustment is made to write the asset down to it fair value and loss is recorded the difference between the carrying value and fair value fair value are determined based on quoted market value discounted cash flow or internal and external appraisal applicable asset to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value we operate integrated transportation network and accordingly cash flow for most of our operating asset to be held and used are assessed at network level not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment in the normal management of our aircraft fleet we routinely idle aircraft and engine temporarily due to maintenance cycle and adjustment of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand level temporarily idled asset are classified available for use and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these asset these temporarily idled asset are assessed for impairment on quarterly basis the criterion for determining whether an asset ha been permanently removed from service and result is potentially impaired include but are not limited to our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume level including capacity need during our peak shipping season the introduction of new fleet type or decision to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operation and change to planned service expansion activity at may we had four aircraft temporarily idled these aircraft have been idled for le than one year and are expected to return to revenue service in may we retired from service seven boeing aircraft and related engine four airbus aircraft and three related engine three airbus aircraft and three related engine and one boeing aircraft and three related engine and related part consequence impairment and related charge of million million net of tax or per diluted share were recorded in the fourth quarter of of this amount million wa non cash the decision to permanently retire these aircraft and engine aligns with fedex express plan to rationalize capacity and modernize it aircraft fleet to more effectively serve it customer goodwill goodwill is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net asset of business acquired several factor give rise to goodwill in our acquisition such the expected benefit from synergy of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment in our evaluation of goodwill impairment we perform qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive we proceed to two step process to table of content test goodwill for impairment including comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying value including attributable goodwill fair value for our reporting unit is determined using an income or market approach incorporating market participant consideration and management assumption on revenue growth rate operating margin discount rate and expected capital expenditure fair value determination may include both internal and third party valuation unless circumstance otherwise dictate we perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter intangible asset intangible asset primarily include customer relationship technology asset and trademark acquired in business combination intangible asset are amortized over period ranging from to year either on straight line basis or on basis consistent with the pattern in which the economic benefit are realized pension and postretirement healthcare plan our defined benefit plan are measured using actuarial technique that reflect management assumption for discount rate investment return on plan asset salary increase expected retirement mortality employee turnover and future increase in healthcare cost we determine the discount rate which is required to be the rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled of the measurement date with the assistance of actuary who calculate the yield on theoretical portfolio of high grade corporate bond rated aa or better with cash flow that are designed to match our expected benefit payment in future year we use the fair value of plan asset to calculate the expected return on plan asset eroa for interim and segment reporting purpose our eroa is judgmental matter which is reviewed on an annual basis and revised appropriate the accounting guidance related to employer accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan we use mark to market or mtm accounting and immediately recognize change in the fair value of plan asset and actuarial gain or loss in our operating result annually in the fourth quarter each year the annual mtm adjustment is recognized at the corporate level and doe not impact segment result the remaining component of pension and postretirement healthcare expense primarily service and interest cost and the eroa are recorded on quarterly basis income tax deferred income tax are provided for the tax effect of temporary difference between the tax basis of asset and liability and their reported amount in the financial statement the liability method is used to account for income tax which requires deferred tax to be recorded at the statutory rate expected to be in effect when the tax are paid we recognize liability for uncertain income tax position based on two step process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any the second step requires to estimate and measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amount we must determine the probability of various possible outcome we reevaluate these uncertain tax position on quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management these reevaluation are based on factor including but not limited to change in fact or circumstance change in tax law successfully settled issue under audit and new audit activity such change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of tax benefit or an increase to the related provision we classify interest related to income tax liability interest expense and if applicable penalty are recognized component of income tax expense the income tax liability and accrued interest and penalty that are due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented current liability the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability and accrued interest and penalty are recorded in the caption other liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet self insurance accrual we are self insured for cost associated with worker compensation claim vehicle accident and general business liability and benefit paid under employee healthcare and disability program accrual are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claim which includes incurred but not reported claim current worker compensation claim vehicle and general liability employee healthcare claim and long term disability are included in accrued expense

second quarter of we chose to early adopt the authoritative guidance issued by the financial accounting standard board fasb requiring acquirer in business combination to recognize adjustment to provisional amount that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period that the adjustment amount are determined and eliminates the requirement to table of content retrospectively account for these adjustment it also requires additional disclosure about the effect of the adjustment on prior period adoption of this guidance had no impact on our financial reporting see note for further discussion regarding our recent business acquisition on may the fasb and international accounting standard board issued new accounting standard that will supersede virtually all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principle in the united state and international financial reporting standard which ha been subsequently updated to defer the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year this standard will be effective for beginning in fiscal the fundamental principle of the new guidance are that company should recognize revenue in manner that reflects the timing of the transfer of service to customer and the amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that company expects to receive for the good and service provided the new guidance establishes five step approach for the recognition of revenue based on our preliminary assessment we do not anticipate that the new guidance will have material impact on our revenue recognition policy practice or system on february the fasb issued the new lease accounting standard which requires lessee to put most lease on their balance sheet but recognize the expense on their income statement in manner similar to current practice the new standard state that lessee will recognize lease liability for the obligation to make lease payment and right of use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term expense related to lease determined to be operating lease will be recognized on straight line basis while those determined to be financing lease will be recognized following front loaded expense profile in which interest and amortization are presented separately in the income statement we are currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on our financial reporting but recognizing the lease liability and related right of use asset will significantly impact our balance sheet these change will be effective for our fiscal year beginning june fiscal with modified retrospective adoption method to the beginning of on november the fasb issued an accounting standard update that will require company to classify all deferred tax asset and liability noncurrent on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred tax into current and noncurrent amount this new guidance had minimal impact on our accounting and financial reporting and we chose to early adopt on retrospective basis in the fourth quarter of in may the fasb issued an accounting standard update that remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy investment for which fair value are estimated using the net asset value practical expedient provided by accounting standard codification fair value measurement this new guidance is effective for entity for fiscal year beginning after december with retrospective application to all period presented we elected to early adopt this standard which impacted our fair value disclosure related to retirement benefit plan investment in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement but did not otherwise impact our financial statement in march the fasb issued an accounting standard update to simplify the accounting for share based payment transaction the new guidance requires company to recognize the income tax effect of award that vest or are settled income tax expense or benefit in the income statement opposed to additional paid in capital is current practice the guidance also provides clarification of the presentation of certain component of share based award in the statement of cash flow additionally the guidance allows company to make policy election to account for forfeiture either upon occurrence or by estimating forfeiture we are currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on our financial reporting these change will be effective for our fiscal year beginning june fiscal we believe that no other new

state local and foreign jurisdiction during the internal revenue service completed the audit of our and tax return without any significant adjustment it is reasonably possible that certain income tax

pension cost and funded status volatility we follow liability driven investment strategy to better align plan asset with liability establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension asset is judgmental matter which we review on an annual basis and revise appropriate management considers the following factor in determining this assumption the duration of our pension plan liability which drive the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan asset the type of investment class in which we invest our pension plan asset and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment class to earn over time and the investment return we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the return we

allege among other thing that they were forced to work off the clock were not paid overtime or were not provided work break or other benefit the complaint generally seek unspecified monetary damage injunctive relief or both we do not believe that material loss is reasonably possible with respect to any of these matter independent contractor lawsuit and state administrative proceeding fedex ground is involved in numerous class action lawsuit including that have been certified class action individual lawsuit and state tax and other administrative proceeding that claim that the company owner operator under contractor model no longer in use should have been treated employee rather than independent contractor most of the class action lawsuit were consolidated for administration of the pre trial proceeding by single federal court the district court for the northern district of indiana the multidistrict litigation court granted class certification in case and denied it in case on december the court entered an opinion and order addressing all outstanding motion for summary judgment on the status of the owner operator independent contractor employee in sum the court ruled on our summary judgment motion and entered judgment in favor of fedex ground on all claim in of the multidistrict litigation case that had been certified class action finding that the owner operator in those case were contractor matter of the law of state the plaintiff filed notice of appeal in all of these case the seventh circuit heard the appeal in the kansa case in january and in july issued an opinion that did not make determination with respect to the correctness of the district court decision and instead certified two question to the kansa supreme court related to the classification of the plaintiff independent contractor under the kansa wage payment act the other case that are before the seventh circuit were stayed on october the kansa supreme court determined that factor right to control test applies to claim under the kansa wage payment act and concluded that under that test the class member were employee not independent contractor the case wa table of content subsequently transferred back to the seventh circuit where both party made filing requesting the action necessary to complete the resolution of the appeal the party also made recommendation to the court regarding next step for the other case that are before the seventh circuit fedex ground requested that each of those case be separately briefed given the potential difference in the applicable state law from that in kansa on july the seventh circuit issued an order and opinion confirming the decision of the kansa supreme court concluding that the class member are employee not independent contractor additionally the seventh circuit referred the other case to representative of the court for purpose of setting case management conference to address briefing and argument for those case during the second quarter of we established an accrual for the estimated probable loss in the kansa case in the second quarter of the kansa case settled and we increased the accrual to the amount of the settlement the settlement will require court approval during the third quarter of we reached agreement in principle to settle all of the case on appeal in the multidistrict independent contractor litigation all of these settlement require court approval we recognized liability for the expected loss net of recognized insurance recovery related to these case and certain other pending independent contractor related proceeding of million the kansa case wa remanded to the multidistrict litigation court and the other case remain at the seventh circuit however approval proceeding will be conducted primarily by the multidistrict litigation court plaintiff filed preliminary approval motion in all case on june and the multidistrict litigation court set fairness hearing for january and the multidistrict litigation court remanded the other eight certified class action back to the district court where they were originally filed because it summary judgment ruling did not completely dispose of all of the claim in those lawsuit three of these matter settled for immaterial amount and have received court approval the case in arkansas and florida settled in the second quarter of and we established an accrual in each of these case for the amount of the settlement the settlement are subject to court approval on january the court preliminarily approved the settlement of the florida case and granted final approval at fairness hearing on july on january the plaintiff filed their motion for preliminary approval of the settlement in the arkansas case two case in oregon and one in california were appealed to the ninth circuit court of appeal where the court reversed the district court decision and held that the plaintiff in california and oregon were employee matter of law and remanded the case to their respective district court for further proceeding in the first quarter of we recognized an accrual for the then estimated probable loss in those case in june the party in the california case reached an agreement to settle the matter for million and in the fourth quarter of we increased the accrual to that amount the court granted final approval of the settlement on june however on june an objector to the class settlement filed an appeal of the court approval of the settlement we anticipate that the appeal will be argued in the spring of the settlement is not effective until all appeal have been resolved without affecting the court approval of the settlement the two case in oregon were consolidated with non multidistrict litigation independent contractor case in oregon the three case collectively settled in the second quarter of and we increased the accrual in these case to the amount of the settlement the settlement wa preliminarily approved on april and the court set fairness hearing for october in addition we are defending contractor model case that are not or are no longer part of the multidistrict litigation these case are in varying stage of litigation we do not expect to incur material loss in these matter however it is reasonably possible that potential loss in some of these lawsuit or change to the independent contractor status of fedex ground owner operator could be material in these case we continue to evaluate what fact may arise in the course of discovery and what legal ruling the court may render and how these fact and ruling might impact fedex ground loss for number of reason we are not currently able to estimate range of reasonably possible loss in these case the number and identity of plaintiff in these lawsuit are uncertain they are dependent on how the class of driver is defined and how many individual will qualify based on whatever criterion may be established in addition the party have conducted only limited discovery into damage in certain of these case which could vary considerably from plaintiff to plaintiff and be dependent on evidence pertaining to individual plaintiff which ha table of content yet to be produced in the case further the range of potential loss could be impacted substantially by future ruling by the court including on the merit of the claim on fedex ground defense and on evidentiary issue consequence of these factor well others that are specific to these case we are not currently able to estimate range of reasonably possible loss we do not believe that material loss is probable in these matter adverse determination in matter related to fedex ground independent contractor could among other thing entitle certain owner operator and their driver to the reimbursement of certain expense and to the benefit of wage and hour law and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for fedex ground we believe that fedex ground owner operator are properly classified independent contractor and that fedex ground is not an employer of the driver of the company independent contractor city and state of new york cigarette suit the city of new york and the state of new york filed two related lawsuit against fedex ground in december and november arising from fedex ground alleged shipment of cigarette to new york resident in contravention of several statute including the racketeer influenced and corrupt organization act rico and new york public health law well common law nuisance claim in april the two lawsuit were consolidated and will now proceed one lawsuit the first filed lawsuit alleges that fedex ground provided delivery service on behalf of four shipper and the second filed lawsuit alleges that fedex ground provided delivery service on behalf of six additional shipper none of these shipper continue to ship in our network pursuant to motion to dismiss filed in both lawsuit some of the claim have been dismissed entirely or limited in the first filed lawsuit the new york public health law and common law nuisance claim were dismissed and the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed another claim in the second filed lawsuit the court dismissed without prejudice to plaintiff right to refile the claim at later date the new york public health law claim other claim including the rico claim remain in both lawsuit the likelihood of loss is reasonably possible but the amount of loss can not be estimated at this stage of the litigation and we expect the amount of any loss to be immaterial environmental matter sec regulation
