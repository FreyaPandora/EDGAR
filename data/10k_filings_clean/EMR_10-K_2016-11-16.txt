analysis is one technique used to forecast the impact of these movement based on hypothetical percent increase in interest rate percent decrease in commodity price or percent weakening in the dollar across all currency the potential loss in future earnings fair value or cash flow are not material sensitivity analysis ha limitation for example weaker dollar would benefit future earnings through favorable translation of non operating result and lower commodity price would benefit future earnings through lower cost of sale see note and through critical accounting policiespreparation of the company financial statement requires management to make judgment assumption and estimate regarding uncertainty that could affect reported revenue expense asset liability and equity note describes the significant accounting policy used in preparation of the consolidated financial statement the most significant area where management judgment and estimate impact the primary financial statement are described below actual result in these area could differ materially from management estimate under different assumption or condition revenue recognitionthe company recognizes nearly all revenue through the sale of manufactured product and record the sale when product are shipped or delivered title and risk of loss pas to the customer and collection is reasonably assured in certain limited circumstance revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method performance occurs or in accordance with asc related to software sale arrangement sometimes involve delivering multiple element which requires management judgment that affect the amount and timing of revenue recognized in these instance the revenue assigned to each element is based on vendor specific objective evidence third party evidence or management estimate of the relative selling price revenue is recognized for delivered element if they have value to the customer on stand alone basis and performance related to the undelivered item is probable and substantially in the company control or the undelivered element are inconsequential or perfunctory and there are no unsatisfied contingency related to payment the vast majority of deliverable are tangible product with smaller portion attributable to installation service or maintenance management belief that all relevant criterion and condition are considered when recognizing revenue are stated at the lower of cost or market the majority of inventory value are based on standard cost which approximate average cost while the remainder are principally valued on first in first basis cost standard are revised at the beginning of each year the annual effect of resetting standard plus any operating variance incurred during each period are allocated to inventory and recognized in cost of sale product is sold the company business review inventory for obsolescence make appropriate provision and dispose of obsolete inventory on regular basis various factor are considered in these review including sale history and recent trend industry condition and general economic condition if actual circumstance indicate decline in any of these factor particularly an abrupt change in economic condition the company could incur higher level of obsolescence expense long lived assetslong lived asset which include property plant and equipment goodwill and identifiable intangible asset are reviewed for impairment whenever event or change in business circumstance indicate impairment may exist if the company determines that the carrying value of long lived asset may not be recoverable permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds it estimated fair value reporting unit are also reviewed for possible goodwill impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter if an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not an impairment may exist it is evaluated by comparing the unit estimated fair value to it carrying value fair value is generally estimated using an income approach that discount estimated future cash flow using discount rate judged by management to be commensurate with the applicable risk estimate of future sale operating result cash flow and discount rate are subject to change in the economic environment including such factor the general level of market interest rate expected equity market return and the volatility of market served particularly when recessionary economic circumstance continue for an extended period of time management belief the estimate of future cash flow and fair value are reasonable however change in estimate due to variance from assumption could materially affect the evaluation retirement plan the company maintains prudent long term investment strategy for it pension asset consistent with the duration of it pension obligation the determination of defined benefit plan expense and liability is dependent on various assumption including the expected annual rate of return on plan asset the discount rate and the rate of annual compensation increase management belief that the assumption used are appropriate however actual experience may differ in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle actual result that differ from the company assumption are accumulated deferred actuarial gain or loss and amortized to expense in future period the company transitioned from defined benefit to defined contribution retirement plan in the principal defined benefit plan closed to employee hired after january
