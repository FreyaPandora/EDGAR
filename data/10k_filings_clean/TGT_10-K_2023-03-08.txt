subject to many risk set forth below are the material risk we face risk are listed in the category where they primarily apply but other category may also apply competitive and reputational risksif we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailer our result of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected we attempt to differentiate our guest experience through careful combination of price merchandise assortment store environment convenience guest service loyalty program and marketing our ability to successfully differentiate ourselves depends on many competitive factor including guest perception regarding the safety and cleanliness of our store the value and exclusivity of our offering our in stock level the effectiveness of our digital channel and fulfillment option our ability to responsibly source merchandise and our ability to create personalized guest experience if we fail to differentiate our guest experience from our competitor our result of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected target form factorstable of contentsindex to financial statementsthe retail industry continuing migration to digital channel and multiple fulfillment option for consumer ha affected the way we differentiate from other retailer since consumer quickly comparison shop using digital tool they may make decision based solely on price or convenience which could limit our ability to differentiate from our competitor in addition providing multiple fulfillment option and implementing new technology is complex costly and may not meet our guest expectation if we are unable to offset the increased cost of new technology and expanded fulfillment option with improved performance or efficiency our result of operation could be adversely affected to remain competitive we must anticipate and adapt to development and offering by other retailer consumer may also use third party channel or device to initiate shopping search and place order which could make dependent on the capability and search algorithm of those third party to reach those consumer any difficulty in executing our differentiation effort could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition if we do not anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preference our result of operation and financial condition could suffer large part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend right decision in broad range of merchandise category if we do not predict and quickly respond to changing consumer preference and spending pattern we may experience lower sale spoilage and increased inventory markdowns which could adversely affect our result of operation our ability to predict and adapt to changing consumer preference depends on many factor including obtaining accurate and relevant data on guest preference emphasizing relevant merchandise category effectively managing our inventory level and implementing competitive and effective pricing and promotion strategy we have not always been able to predict rapid change in consumer preference and spending pattern including those that were impacted by the covid pandemic which ha previously resulted in insufficient or excess inventory increased cost and adverse impact on our result of operation if we are unable to effectively adapt to future change in consumer preference and spending pattern our result of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected our continued success is dependent on positive perception of target which if eroded could adversely affect our business and our relationship with our guest and team member we believe that one of the reason our shareholder guest team member and vendor choose target is the positive reputation we have built over many year for serving those constituency and the community in which we operate to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve target reputation our reputation is largely based on perception it may be difficult to address negative publicity across medium channel regardless of whether it is accurate negative incident involving our workforce or others with we do business could quickly erode trust and confidence and result in consumer boycott workforce unrest or walkout government investigation and litigation negative reputational incident or negative perception of could adversely affect our business and result of operation including through lower sale the termination of business relationship loss of new store and development opportunity and team member retention and recruiting difficulty in addition stakeholder expectation regarding environmental social and governance matter continue to evolve and are not uniform we have established and may continue to establish various goal and initiative on these matter including with respect to diversity equity and inclusion topic we can not guarantee that we achieve these goal and initiative any failure or perceived failure by to achieve these goal and initiative or to otherwise meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectation could adversely affect our reputation and result in legal and regulatory proceeding any of these outcome could negatively impact our result of operation and financial condition reputational harm can also occur indirectly through company with whom we do business we have relationship with variety of other company including apple cv disney levi starbucks and ulta beauty if our guest have negative experience with or view unfavorably any of the company with whom we have relationship it could cause them to stop shopping with target form factorstable of contentsindex to financial statementsif we are unable to successfully develop source and market our owned and exclusive brand product our result of operation could be adversely affected our owned and exclusive brand product represent approximately one third of our overall sale and generally carry higher margin than equivalent national brand product if we are unable to successfully develop source and market our owned and exclusive brand or if we are unable to successfully protect our related intellectual property right our result of operation could be adversely affected in addition our reliance on owned and exclusive brand product may also amplify other risk discussed in this item risk factor because many of these product are imported and we are more involved in the development and sourcing of those product for example owned brand product involve greater responsible sourcing risk in the selection of vendor which can exacerbate reputational risk in addition owned brand product generally require longer lead time between order placement and product delivery and require to take ownership of those product earlier in the supply chain this expose to enhanced risk of supply chain disruption and changing consumer preference which could adversely affect our result of operation if we are unable to protect against inventory shrink our result of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected our business depends on our ability to effectively manage our inventory we have historically experienced loss of inventory also called shrink due to damage theft including from organized retail crime and other cause we continue to experience elevated level of inventory shrink relative to historical level which have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition to protect against rising inventory shrink we have taken and may continue to take certain operational and strategic action that could adversely affect our reputation guest experience and result of operation in addition sustained high rate of inventory shrink at certain store could impact the profitability of those store and result in the impairment of long term asset investment and infrastructure risksif our capital investment do not achieve appropriate return our competitive position result of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected our business depends in part on our ability to remodel existing store and build new store in manner that achieves appropriate return on our capital investment when building new store we compete with other retailer and business for suitable location for our store pursuing the wrong remodel or new store opportunity and any delay cost increase or other difficulty related to those project could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition we are making and expect to continue to make significant investment in technology and supply chain infrastructure the effectiveness of these investment can be le predictable than remodeling or building new store and might not provide the anticipated benefit which could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition for example our store hub strategy depends on adequate replenishment facility to receive store and move inventory to store on timely basis underestimating our replenishment capacity need could result in lower in stock level or increased cost for temporary storage conversely overestimating replenishment capacity need could result in inefficient deployment of capital any of these outcome could adversely affect our

malicious attack security breach and implementation error if our system are damaged or disrupted we may incur substantial cost experience data loss or theft and be unable to manage inventory or process guest transaction which could adversely affect our reputation result of operation and financial condition for example in the past we have experienced disruption in our point of sale system that prevented our ability to process debit or credit transaction which negatively impacted guest experience and generated negative publicity we continually invest to maintain and update our system but implementing significant change increase the risk of system disruption problem and interruption associated with implementing technology initiative could adversely affect our operational efficiency and negatively impact our guest and their confidence in information security cybersecurity and data privacy risksif our effort to maintain information security cybersecurity and data privacy are

store information about our guest team member vendor and other third party we have program in place to detect contain and respond to data security incident however we may be unable to anticipate security incident or implement adequate preventive measure in addition hardware or software that we develop or obtain from third party may contain defect that could compromise information security cybersecurity or data privacy unauthorized party may also attempt to gain access to our system or facility or those of third party with whom we do business through fraud deception or other bad act although we conduct regular training part of our information security cybersecurity and data privacy effort that training may not be completely effective in preventing successful attack our significant data security incident wa data breach that occurred in and went undetected for several week the data breach adversely affected our reputation and result of operation we and our vendor have experienced data security incident since that data breach however to date these other incident have not been material to our result of operation based on the prominence and notoriety of our prior significant data breach additional data security incident could draw greater scrutiny if we our vendor or other third party with whom we do business experience additional significant data security incident or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant incident we could be exposed to costly government enforcement action and private litigation in addition our guest could lose confidence in our ability to protect their information stop using our redcards or loyalty program or stop shopping with altogether which could adversely affect our reputation result of operation and financial condition the legal and regulatory environment regarding information security cybersecurity and data privacy is dynamic and ha strict requirement for using and treating personal data

litigation and regulatory risk each of which could adversely affect our reputation result of operation and financial condition supply chain and third party riskschanges in our relationship with our vendor change in tax or trade policy interruption in our operation or supply chain and increased commodity or supply chain cost could adversely affect our reputation and result of operation we are dependent on our vendor including common carrier to supply merchandise to our distribution center store and guest if our replenishment and fulfillment network not operate properly if vendor fails to

portion of the merchandise that we offer is sourced directly or indirectly from outside the with china our single largest source any major change in tax or trade policy between the and country from which we source merchandise such the imposition of additional tariff or duty on imported product could require to take certain action including raising price on product we sell and seeking alternative

diversion labor dispute and congestion disrupting port including in california where we receive significant portion of the product we source from outside the we have from time to time made alternative arrangement to continue the flow of inventory result of supply chain disruption in the and other country if these type of event recur it could increase our cost and adversely affect our supply of inventory in addition price of fuel and other commodity that our supply chain depends on are historically volatile and subject to fluctuation based on variety of international and domestic factor

historically our actual physical inventory count result have shown our estimate to be reliable market adjustment for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise ha diminished salability can be impacted by consumer preference and seasonality among other factor we believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turn in le than

income earned can vary based on number of factor including purchase volume sale volume and our pricing and promotion strategy we establish receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on historical trending and data this receivable is computed by forecasting vendor income collection and estimating the amount earned the majority of the year end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that the assumption used in our estimate will change significantly historically

million the discount rate used to determine benefit obligation is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bond using yield for maturity that are in line with the duration of our pension liability our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with change in interest rate percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would

risk factor to this form which should be read in conjunction with the forward looking statement in this report forward looking statement speak only of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskas of january our exposure to market risk wa primarily from interest rate change on our debt obligation and short term investment some of which are at london interbank offered rate libor our interest rate exposure is primarily due to difference between our floating rate debt obligation compared to our floating rate short term investment of january our floating rate debt exceeded our floating rate short term investment by approximately billion based on our balance sheet position of january the annualized effect of percentage point increase in floating interest rate on our floating rate debt obligation net of our floating rate short term investment would decrease our earnings before income tax by million in general we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short term investment over time but that may vary in different interest rate and economic environment see further description of our debt and derivative instrument in note and to the financial statement the united kingdom financial conduct authority ha announced the intent to phase out libor by june we do not expect the phase out to materially impact our financial statement liquidity or access to capital market we record our general liability and worker compensation liability at net present value therefore these liability fluctuate with change in interest rate based on our balance sheet position of january the annualized effect of percentage point increase decrease in interest rate would increase decrease earnings before income tax by million in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuation on our qualified defined benefit pension plan the value of our pension liability is inversely related to change in interest rate percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million to protect against decline in interest rate we hold high quality long duration bond and derivative instrument in our pension plan trust of january we hedged percent of the interest rate exposure of our plan liability more fully described in note to the financial statement we are exposed to market return on accumulated team member balance in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan we control the risk of offering
