emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate we or license number of patent in the and foreign country primarily covering our product we have also developed many brand name and trademark for our product we consider the overall protection of our patent trademark license and other intellectual property right to be of material value and act to protect these right from infringement in the pharmaceutical industry the majority of an innovative product commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product ha market exclusivity product market exclusivity is generally determined by two form of intellectual property patent right held by the innovator company and any regulatory form of exclusivity to which the innovative drug is entitled patent are key determinant of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceutical patent provide the innovator with the right to exclude others from practicing an invention related to the medicine patent may cover among other thing the active ingredient various us of drug product pharmaceutical formulation drug delivery mechanism and process for or intermediate useful in the manufacture of product protection for individual product extends for varying period in accordance with the expiration date of patent in the various country the protection afforded which may also vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent it scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedy in the country market exclusivity is also sometimes influenced by regulatory intellectual property right many developed country provide certain non patent incentive for the development of medicine for example in the the eu japan and certain other country regulatory intellectual property right are offered incentive for research on medicine for rare disease or orphan drug and on medicine useful in treating pediatric patient these incentive extend the market exclusivity period on product beyond the patent term the eu and japan also each provide for minimum period of time after the approval of new drug during which the regulatory agency may not rely upon the innovator data to approve competitor generic copy or data protection in region such china however is questionable whether such data protection law are enforceable in certain market patent protection and other form of market exclusivity may have expired data protection can be of particular importance however most regulatory form of exclusivity not prevent competitor from gaining regulatory approval prior to the expiration of regulatory data exclusivity on the basis of the competitor own safety and efficacy data on it drug even that drug is identical to that marketed by the innovator specific aspect of the law governing market exclusivity and data protection for pharmaceutical vary from country to country the following summarizes key exclusivity rule in market representing significant sale united statesin the most of our key product are protected by patent with varying term depending on the type of patent and the filing date significant portion of product patent life however is lost during the time it take an innovative company to develop and obtain regulatory approval of new drug compensation at least in part for the lost patent term the innovator may depending on number of factor extend the expiration date of one patent to maximum term of five year provided that the extension can not cause the patent to be in effect for year from the date of drug approval company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical in the must submit complete set of safety and efficacy data to the fda if the innovative pharmaceutical is chemical the company file an nda if the medicine is biological product bla is filed the type of application filed affect regulatory exclusivity right chemical productsa competitor seeking to launch generic substitute of chemical innovative drug in the must file an anda with the fda in the anda the generic manufacturer need to demonstrate bioequivalence the generic substitute and the approved nda drug the anda relies upon the safety and efficacy data previously filed by the innovator in it nda an innovator company is required to list certain of it patent covering the medicine with the fda in is commonly known the orange book absent successful patent challenge the fda can not approve an anda after the innovator listed patent expire however after the innovator ha marketed it product for four year generic manufacturer may file an anda and allege that one or more of the patent listed in the orange book under an innovator nda is either invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known paragraph iv certification the innovator must decide whether to file patent infringement suit the generic manufacturer from time to time andas including paragraph iv certification are filed with respect to certain of our product we evaluate these andas on case by case basis and where warranted file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect our patent right in addition to benefiting from patent protection certain innovative pharmaceutical product can receive period of regulatory exclusivity an nda that is designated an orphan drug can receive seven year of exclusivity for the orphan indication during this time period neither ndas andas for the drug product can be approved for the same orphan use company may also earn six month of additional exclusivity for drug where specific clinical trial are conducted at the written request of the fda to study the use of the medicine to treat pediatric patient and submission to the fda is made prior to the loss of basic exclusivity medicine approved under an nda can also receive several type of regulatory data protection an innovative chemical pharmaceutical is entitled to five year of regulatory data protection in the during which competitor can not file with the fda for approval of generic substitute if an innovator patent is challenged described generic manufacturer may file it anda after the fourth year of the five year data protection period pharmaceutical drug product that contains an active ingredient that ha been previously approved in an nda is approved in new formulation but not for the drug or for new indication on the basis of new clinical trial receives three year of data protection for that formulation or indication biologic productsthe healthcare legislation enacted in created an approval pathway for biosimilar version of innovative biological product that not previously exist prior to that time innovative biologics had essentially unlimited regulatory exclusivity under the new regulatory mechanism the fda can approve product that are similar to but not generic copy of innovative biologics on the basis of le extensive data than is required by full bla after an innovator ha marketed it product for four year any manufacturer may file an application for approval of biosimilar version of the innovator product however although an application for approval of biosimilar may be filed four year after approval of the innovator product qualified innovative biological product will receive year of regulatory exclusivity meaning that the fda may not approve biosimilar version until year after the innovative biological product wa first approved by the fda the law also provides mechanism for innovator to enforce the patent that protect innovative biological product and for biosimilar applicant to challenge the patent such patent litigation may begin early four year after the innovative biological product is first approved by the fda in the the increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenge to innovator intellectual property ha increased the risk of loss of innovator market exclusivity first generic company have increasingly sought to challenge innovator basic patent covering major pharmaceutical product second statutory and regulatory provision in the limit the ability of an innovator company to prevent generic and biosimilar drug from approved and launched patent litigation is ongoing result of all of these development it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for particular product with certainty based solely on the expiration of the relevant patent or the current form of regulatory exclusivity european unionpatents on pharmaceutical product are generally enforceable in the eu and in the may be extended to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process such extension are granted on country by country basis primary route we use to obtain marketing authorization of pharmaceutical product in the eu is through the centralized procedure this procedure is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical product in particular using biotechnological process and is also available for certain new chemical compound and product company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file complete set of safety data and efficacy data part of an maa with the ema after the ema evaluates the maa it provides recommendation to the ec and the ec then approves or denies the maa it is also possible for new chemical product to obtain marketing authorization in the eu through mutual recognition procedure in which an application is made to single member state and if the member state approves the pharmaceutical product under national procedure then the applicant may submit that approval to the mutual recognition procedure of some or all other member state after obtaining marketing authorization approval company must obtain pricing and reimbursement for the pharmaceutical product which is typically subject to member state law in certain eu country this process can take place simultaneously while the product is marketed but in other eu country this process must be completed the company can market the new product the pricing and reimbursement procedure can take month and sometimes year to complete throughout the eu all product for which marketing authorization have been filed after october november are subject to an regime eight year after the innovator ha received it first community authorization for medicinal product generic company may file marketing authorization application for that product with the health authority if the marketing authorization application is approved the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either or year have elapsed from the initial marketing authorization granted to the innovator the possible extension to year is available if the innovator during the first eight year of the marketing authorization obtains an additional indication that is of significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing treatment for product that were filed prior to october november there is year period of data protection under the centralized procedure and period of either six or year under the mutual recognition procedure depending on the member state in contrast to the patent in the eu are not listed with regulatory authority generic version of pharmaceutical product can be approved after data protection expires regardless of whether the innovator hold patent covering it drug thus it is possible that an innovator may be seeking to enforce it patent against generic competitor that is already marketing it product also the european patent system ha an opposition procedure in which generic manufacturer may challenge the validity of patent covering innovator product within nine month of grant in general eu law treat chemically synthesized drug and biologically derived drug the same with respect to intellectual property and data protection in addition to the relevant legislation and annex related to biologic medicinal product the ema ha issued guideline that outline the additional information to be provided for biosimilar product also known generic biologics in order to review an application for marketing approval japanin japan medicine of new chemical entity are generally afforded eight year of data exclusivity for approved indication and dosage patent on pharmaceutical product are enforceable generic copy can receive regulatory approval after data exclusivity and patent expiration in the patent in japan may be extended to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process in general japanese law treat chemically synthesized and biologically derived drug the same with respect to intellectual property and market exclusivity rest of the worldin country outside of the the eu and japan there is wide variety of legal system with respect to intellectual property and market exclusivity of pharmaceutical most other developed country utilize system similar to either the or the eu among developing country some have adopted patent law and or regulatory exclusivity law while others have not some developing country have formally adopted law in order to comply with wto commitment but have not taken step to implement these law in meaningful way enforcement of wto action is long process between government and there is no assurance of the outcome thus in assessing the likely future market exclusivity of our innovative drug in developing country we take into account not only formal legal right but political and other factor well in the the eu and some other country when these patent right and other form of exclusivity expire and generic version of medicine are approved and marketed there are often substantial and rapid decline in the sale of the original innovative product for discussion of patent right and regulatory form of exclusivity refer to intellectual property and product exclusivity below for further discussion of the impact of generic competition on our business refer to generic competition below following chart show our key product together with the year in which the earliest basic exclusivity loss patent right or data exclusivity occurred or is currently estimated to occur in the the eu and japan we also sell our pharmaceutical product in other country however data is not provided on country by country basis individual country revenue are not significant outside the the eu and japan in many instance the basic exclusivity loss date listed below is the expiration date of the patent that claim the active ingredient of the drug or the method of using the drug for the approved indication if there is only one approved indication in some instance the basic exclusivity loss date listed in the chart is the expiration date of the data exclusivity period in situation where there is only data exclusivity without patent protection competitor could seek regulatory approval by submitting it own clinical trial data to obtain marketing approval prior to the expiration of data exclusivity we estimate the market exclusivity period for each of our product for the purpose of business planning only the length of market exclusivity for any of our product is impossible to predict with certainty because of the complex interaction between patent and regulatory form of exclusivity and the inherent uncertainty regarding patent litigation there can be no assurance that particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full period of time that appears in the estimate or that the exclusivity will be limited to the estimate total revenue by product past or currently estimated year of basic

position for our product but product exclusivity can not be predicted or assured under the healthcare law enacted in qualifying biologic product will receive year of data exclusivity before biosimilar

developmentr is critical to our long term competitiveness we have major site throughout the world part of our operating model evolution the geographic footprint will significantly transform to foster speed and innovation in the future the transformation involves the closing of several existing site accompanied by increased investment in the expansion of others specifically in the we supplement our internal drug discovery and development program with alliance and collaborative agreement which help bring new molecular agent capability and platform into our pipeline management continues to emphasize leadership innovation productivity and quality strategy for success in our activity we concentrate our effort in the following disease area with significant unmet medical need oncology including io immunoscience cardiovascular fibrotic disease and gdd we also continue to analyze and may selectively pursue promising lead in other area in addition to discovering and developing new molecular entity we look for way to expand the value of existing product through new indication and formulation that can provide additional benefit to patient in order for new drug to reach the market industry practice and government regulation in the the eu and most foreign country provide for the determination of drug effectiveness and safety through preclinical test and controlled clinical evaluation the clinical development of potential new drug includes phase phase ii and phase iii clinical trial that have been designed specifically to support new drug application for particular indication assuming the trial are successful phase clinical trial involve small number of healthy volunteer or patient suffering from the indicated disease to test for safety and proper dosing phase ii clinical trial involve larger patient population to investigate side effect efficacy and optimal dosage of the drug candidate phase iii clinical trial are conducted to confirm phase ii result in significantly larger patient population longer term and to provide reliable and conclusive data regarding the safety and efficacy of drug candidate although regulatory approval is typically based on the result of phase iii clinical trial there are time when approval can be granted based on data from earlier trial we consider our program in phase iii to be our significant program these program include investigational compound in phase iii development for initial indication and marketed product that are in phase iii development for additional indication or formulation drug development is time consuming expensive and risky the process typically take about fourteen year with approximately two and half year often spent in phase iii or late stage development on average only about one in chemical compound discovered by pharmaceutical industry researcher prof to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine drug candidate can fail at any stage of the process and even late stage product candidate sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval according to the kmr group based on industry success rate from approximately of the compound that enter phase development fail to achieve regulatory approval the failure rate for compound that enter phase ii development is approximately and for compound that enter phase iii development it is approximately total expense include the cost of discovery research preclinical development early and late stage clinical development and drug formulation well post commercialization and medical support of marketed product proportionate allocation of enterprise wide cost and licensing and acquiring asset expense were billion in billion in and billion in including license and asset acquisition charge of approximately million billion and million in and at the end of we employed approximately people in and related support activity including substantial number of physician scientist holding graduate or postgraduate degree and higher skilled technical personnel we manage our program on portfolio basis investing resource in each stage of from early discovery through late stage development we continually evaluate our portfolio of asset to ensure that there is an appropriate balance of early stage and late stage program to support the future growth of the company spending on our late stage development program represented approximately of our annual expense in the last three year no individual investigational compound or marketed product represented or more of our expense in any of the last three year except opdivo in both and listed below are our investigational compound that we have in clinical trial well the approved and potential indication for our marketed product in the related therapeutic area of january whether any of the listed compound ultimately becomes marketed product depends on the result of clinical study the competitive landscape of the potential product market reimbursement decision by payer and the manufacturing process necessary to produce the potential product on commercial scale among other factor there can be no assurance that we will seek regulatory approval of any of these compound or that if such approval is sought it will be obtained there is also no assurance that compound which get approved will be commercially successful at this stage of development we can not determine all intellectual property issue or all the patent protection that may or may not be available for these investigational compound of january the following

and or sell pharmaceutical product that are owned by other party these alliance include licensing arrangement co development and co marketing agreement co promotion arrangement and joint venture when such alliance involve sharing research and development cost the risk of incurring all research and development expense for compound that do not lead to revenue generating product is reduced however profitability on alliance product is generally lower because profit from alliance product are shared with our alliance partner we actively pursue such arrangement and view alliance an important complement to our own discovery development and commercialization activity each of our alliance with third party who own the right to manufacture market and or sell pharmaceutical product contain customary early termination provision typically found in agreement of this kind and are generally based on the material breach of the agreement by party or bankruptcy voluntary or involuntary of party or product safety concern the amount of notice required for early termination generally range from immediately upon notice to day after receipt of notice termination immediately upon notice is generally available where the other party file voluntary bankruptcy petition or if material safety issue arises with product such that the medical risk benefit is incompatible with the welfare of patient to continue to develop or commercialize the product termination with notice period is generally available where an involuntary bankruptcy petition ha been filed and ha not been dismissed or material breach by party ha occurred and not been cured most of our alliance agreement also permit to terminate without cause which is typically exercisable with substantial advance written notice and is sometimes exercisable only after specified period of time ha elapsed after the alliance agreement is signed our alliance typically do not otherwise contain provision that provide the other party the right to terminate the alliance in general we do not retain any right to product brought to an alliance by another party or to the other party intellectual property after an alliance terminates the loss of right to one or more product that are marketed and sold by pursuant to an alliance could be material to our result of operation and cash flow could be material to our financial condition and liquidity is customary in the pharmaceutical industry the term of our alliance generally are co extensive with the exclusivity period and may vary on country by country basis our most significant alliance for both currently marketed product and investigational compound are described below refer to item financial statement note alliance for additional information on these alliance agreement well other alliance agreement pfizerthe company and pfizer are party to worldwide co development and co commercialization agreement for eliquis pfizer fund between and of all development cost depending on the study the company share commercialization expense and profit and loss equally on global basis except in certain country where pfizer commercializes eliquis and pay bm compensation

nurse practitioner physician assistant pharmacist technologist hospital pbms and mcos we also provide information about the appropriate use of our product to consumer in the through direct to consumer print radio television and digital advertising and promotion in addition we sponsor general advertising to educate the public about our innovative medical research and corporate mission for discussion of the regulation of promotion and marketing of pharmaceutical refer to government regulation below through our field sale and medical organization we explain the risk and benefit of the approved us of our product to medical professional we work to gain access for our product on formulary and reimbursement plan list of recommended or approved medicine and other product including medicare part plan by providing information about the clinical profile of our product our marketing and sale of prescription pharmaceutical is limited to the approved us of the particular product but we continue to develop scientific data and other information about potential additional us of our product and provide such information in response to unsolicited inquiry from doctor other medical professional and mcos our operation include several marketing and sale organization each product marketing organization is supported by sale force which may be responsible for selling one or more product we also have marketing organization that focus on certain class of customer such managed care entity or certain type of marketing tool such digital or consumer communication our sale force focus on communicating information about new product or new us well established product and promotion to physician is increasingly targeted at physician specialist who treat the patient in need of our medicine our product are sold principally to wholesaler and to lesser extent directly to distributor retailer hospital clinic government agency and pharmacy refer to item financial statement note business segment information for gross revenue to the three largest pharmaceutical wholesaler in the percentage of our global gross revenue our business ha imas with substantially all of our direct wholesaler and distributor customer that allow to monitor wholesaler inventory level and requires those wholesaler and distributor to maintain inventory level that are no more than one month of demand the imas including those with our three largest wholesaler expire in december subject to certain termination provision our non business have significantly more direct customer information on available direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out movement information and the reliability of third party demand information varies widely we limit our direct customer sale channel inventory reporting to where we can reliably gather and report inventory level from our customer number of country outside of the we contract with distributor to support certain product the service provided by these distributor vary by market but may include distribution and logistics regulatory and pharmacovigilance and or sale advertising or promotion sale in these distributor based country represented approximately of the company total revenue in competitionthe market in which we compete are generally broad based and highly competitive we compete with other worldwide research based drug company many smaller research company with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug manufacturer important competitive factor include product efficacy safety and ease of use price and demonstrated cost effectiveness marketing effectiveness product labeling customer service and of new product and process sale of our product can be impacted by new study that indicate competitor product is safer or more effective for treating disease or particular form of disease than one of our product our revenue also can be impacted by additional labeling requirement relating to safety or convenience that may be imposed on product by the fda or by similar regulatory agency in different country if competitor introduce new product and process with therapeutic or cost advantage our product can be subject to progressive price reduction or decreased volume of sale or both generic competitionone of the biggest competitive challenge that we face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturer in the and the eu the regulatory approval process exempts generic from costly and time consuming clinical trial to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturer to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product result generic pharmaceutical manufacturer typically invest far le in than research based pharmaceutical company and therefore can price their product significantly lower than branded product accordingly when branded product loses it market exclusivity it normally face intense price competition from generic form of the product upon the expiration or loss of market exclusivity on product we can lose the major portion of revenue of that product in short period of time the rate of revenue decline of product after the expiration of exclusivity varies by country in general the decline in the market is more rapid than in most other developed country though we have observed rapid decline in number of eu country well also the decline in developed country tend to be more rapid than in developing country the rate of revenue decline after the expiration of exclusivity ha also historically been influenced by product characteristic for example drug that are used in large patient population those prescribed by key primary care physician tend to experience more rapid decline than drug in specialized area of medicine oncology drug that are more complex to manufacture sterile injectable product usually experience slower decline than those that are simpler to manufacture in certain country outside the patent protection is weak or nonexistent and we must compete with generic version shortly after we launch our innovative product in addition generic pharmaceutical company may introduce generic product before exclusivity ha expired and before the resolution of any related patent litigation for more information about market exclusivity refer to intellectual property and product exclusivity above we believe our long term competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and developing innovative cost effective product that serve unmet medical need together with our ability to manufacture product efficiently and to market effectively in highly competitive environment pricing price constraint and market accessour medicine are priced based on number of factor including the value of scientific innovation for patient and society in the context of overall health care spend economic factor impacting health care system ability to provide appropriate and sustainable access and the necessity to sustain our investment in innovation platform to address serious unmet medical need central to price is the clinical value that this innovation brings to the market the current landscape of alternative treatment option the goal of ensuring appropriate patient access to this innovation and sustaining investment in creative platform we continue to explore new pricing approach to ensure that patient have access to our medicine enhancing patient access to medicine is priority for we are focused on offering creative tiered pricing voluntary licensing reimbursement support and patient assistance program to optimize access while protecting innovation advocating for sustainable healthcare policy and infrastructure leveraging advocacy payer input and utilizing partnership appropriate and improving access to care and supportive service for vulnerable patient through partnership and demonstration project the growth of mcos in the is also major factor in the healthcare marketplace over half of the population now participates in some version of managed care mcos can include medical insurance company medical plan administrator health maintenance organization medicare part prescription drug plan alliance of hospital and physician and other physician organization those organization have been consolidating into fewer larger entity thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance to successfully compete for business with mcos we must often demonstrate that our product offer not only medical benefit but also cost advantage compared with other form of care most new product that we introduce compete with other product already on the market or product that are later developed by competitor noted above generic drug are exempt from costly and time consuming clinical trial to demonstrate their safety and efficacy and such often have lower cost than brand name drug mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drug often favor generic for this reason many government also encourage the use of generic alternative to brand name drug in their healthcare program law in the generally allow and in many case require pharmacist to substitute generic drug that have been rated under government procedure to be essentially equivalent to brand name drug the substitution must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it exclusion of product from formulary can lead to it sharply reduced usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical company compete aggressively to have their product included where possible company compete for inclusion based upon unique feature of their product such greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effect lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor product that demonstrate fewer therapeutic advantage must compete for inclusion based primarily on price we have been generally although not universally successful in our major product included on mco formulary in many market outside the we operate in an environment of government mandated cost containment program in these market significant portion of funding for healthcare service and the determination of pricing and reimbursement for pharmaceutical product is subject to government control result our product may face restricted access by both public and private payer and may be subject to assessment of comparative value and effectiveness against competitive product several government have placed restriction on physician prescription level and patient reimbursement emphasized greater use of generic drug and or enacted across the board price cut method of cost control in most eu country for example the government regulates pricing of new product at launch often through direct price control international price comparison controlling profit and or reference pricing in other market such germany the government doe not set pricing restriction at launch but pricing freedom is subsequently limited company may also face significant delay in market access for new product mainly in france spain italy and belgium and more than year can elapse before new medicine become available on some national market additionally member state of the eu have regularly imposed new or additional cost containment measure for pharmaceutical such volume discount cost cap cost sharing for increase in excess of prior year cost for individual product or aggregated market level spending outcome based pricing scheme and free product for portion of the expected therapy period in recent year italy for example ha imposed mandatory price decrease the existence of price differential within the eu due to the different national pricing and reimbursement law lead to significant parallel trade flow government regulationthe pharmaceutical industry is subject to extensive global regulation by regional country state and local agency the federal food drug and cosmetic act other federal statute and regulation various state statute and regulation and law and regulation of foreign government govern to varying degree the testing approval production labeling distribution post market surveillance advertising dissemination of information and promotion of our product the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for required governmental approval is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introduction in given market promotion marketing manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical product are extensively regulated in all major world market in addition our operation are subject to complex federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety law and regulation we anticipate that the law and regulation affecting the manufacture and sale of current product and the introduction of new product will continue to require substantial scientific and technical effort time and expense well significant capital investment of particular importance is the fda in the it ha jurisdiction over virtually all of our activity and imposes requirement covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling marketing advertising and post marketing surveillance of our product in many case the fda requirement have increased the amount of time and money necessary to develop new product and bring them to market in the the fda mandate that drug be manufactured packaged and labeled in conformity with cgmp established by the fda in complying with cgmp regulation manufacturer must continue to expend time money and effort in production recordkeeping and quality control to ensure that product meet applicable specification and other requirement to ensure product safety and efficacy the fda periodically inspects our drug manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with applicable cgmp requirement failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirement subject to possible legal or regulatory action such suspension of manufacturing seizure of product or voluntary recall of product adverse experience with the use of product must be reported to the fda and could result in the imposition of market restriction through labeling change or product removal product approval may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirement is not maintained or if problem concerning safety or efficacy occur following approval federal government ha extensive enforcement power over the activity of pharmaceutical manufacturer including authority to withdraw or delay product approval commence action to seize and prohibit the sale of unapproved or non complying product to halt manufacturing operation that are not in compliance with cgmps and to impose or seek injunction voluntary recall civil monetary and criminal penalty such restriction or prohibition on sale or withdrawal of approval of product marketed by could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation and cash flow marketing authorization for our product is subject to revocation by the applicable governmental agency in addition modification or enhancement of approved product or change in manufacturing location are in many circumstance subject to additional fda approval which may or may not be received and which may be subject to lengthy application process the distribution of pharmaceutical product is subject to the pdma part of the federal food drug and cosmetic act which regulates such activity at both the federal and state level under the pdma and it implementing regulation state are permitted to require registration of manufacturer and distributor who provide pharmaceutical even if such manufacturer or distributor have no place of business within the state state are also permitted to adopt regulation limiting the distribution of product sample to licensed practitioner the pdma also imposes extensive licensing personnel recordkeeping packaging quantity labeling product handling and facility storage and security requirement intended to prevent the sale of pharmaceutical product sample or other product diversion the fda amendment act of imposed additional obligation on pharmaceutical company and delegated more enforcement authority to the fda in the area of drug safety key element of this legislation give the fda authority to require that company conduct post marketing safety study of drug impose certain drug labeling change relating to safety mandate risk mitigation measure such the education of healthcare provider and the restricted distribution of medicine require company to publicly disclose data from clinical trial and pre review television advertisement the marketing practice of all pharmaceutical manufacturer are subject to federal and state healthcare law that are used to protect the integrity of government healthcare program the oig oversees compliance with applicable federal law in connection with the payment for product by government funded program primarily medicaid and medicare these law include the federal anti kickback statute which criminalizes the offering of something of value to induce the recommendation order or purchase of product or service reimbursed under government healthcare program the oig ha issued series of guidance to segment of the healthcare industry including the compliance program guidance for pharmaceutical manufacturer which includes recommendation that pharmaceutical manufacturer at minimum adhere to the phrma code voluntary industry code of marketing practice we subscribe to the phrma code and have implemented compliance program to address the requirement set forth in the guidance and our compliance with the healthcare law failure to comply with these healthcare law could subject to administrative and legal proceeding including action by federal and state government agency such action could result in the imposition of civil and criminal sanction which may include fine penalty and injunctive remedy the impact of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation and cash flow we are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal and state regulatory and enforcement department and agency such the federal trade commission the department of justice and the department of health and human service in the we are also licensed by the drug enforcement agency to procure and produce controlled substance we are therefore subject to possible administrative and legal proceeding and action by these organization such action may result in the imposition of civil and criminal sanction which may include fine penalty and injunctive or administrative remedy the healthcare industry is subject to various government imposed regulation authorizing price or price control that have and will continue to have an impact on our total revenue we participate in state government medicaid program well certain other qualifying federal and state government program whereby discount and rebate are provided to participating state and local government entity we also participate in government program that specify discount to certain government entity the most significant of which are the department of defense and the department of veteran affair these entity receive minimum discount based defined non federal average manufacturer price for purchase result of the patient protection and affordable care act hr and the reconciliation bill containing package of change to the healthcare bill we have experienced and will continue to experience additional financial cost and certain other change to our business for example minimum rebate on our medicaid drug sale have increased from percent to percent and medicaid rebate have also been extended to drug used in risk based medicaid managed care plan in addition we extend discount to certain critical access hospital cancer hospital and other covered entity required by the expansion of the drug pricing program under the public health service act we are required to provide percent discount on our brand name drug to patient who fall within the medicare part coverage gap also referred to the donut hole and pay an annual non tax deductible fee to the federal government based on an allocation of our market share of branded drug sale to certain government program including medicare medicaid department of veteran affair department of defense and tricare activity outside the are also subject to regulatory requirement governing the testing approval safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling and marketing of our product these regulatory requirement vary from country to country whether or not fda approval or approval of the ec ha been obtained for product approval of the product by comparable regulatory authority of country outside of the or the eu the case may be must be obtained prior to marketing the product in those country the approval process may be more or le rigorous from country to country and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required in the approval in one country doe not assure that product will be approved in another country for further discussion of these rebate and program refer to item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation total revenue and critical accounting policy source and availability of raw materialsin general we purchase our raw material and supply required for the production of our product in the open market for some product we purchase our raw material and supply from one source the only source available to or single source the only approved source among many available to thereby requiring to obtain such raw material and supply from that particular source we attempt if possible to mitigate our raw material supply risk through inventory management and alternative sourcing strategy for further discussion of sourcing refer to manufacturing and quality assurance below and discussion of particular product manufacturing and quality assurancewe operate and manage our manufacturing network in manner that permit to improve efficiency while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity pharmaceutical production process are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product given that shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be lengthy process requiring significant capital and other expenditure well regulatory approval we maintain and operate our flexible manufacturing network consisting of internal and external resource that minimize unnecessary product transfer and inefficient us of manufacturing capacity for further discussion of the regulatory impact on our manufacturing refer to government regulation and price constraint above our pharmaceutical manufacturing facility are located in the puerto rico france italy ireland japan and china and require significant ongoing capital investment for both maintenance and compliance with increasing regulatory requirement in addition our product line change over the next several year we expect to continue modification of our existing manufacturing network to meet complex processing standard that may be required for newly introduced product including biologics biologics manufacturing involves more complex process than those of traditional pharmaceutical operation the fda approved our large scale multi product bulk biologics manufacturing facility in devens massachusetts in may and we continue to make capital investment in this facility we are building new large scale biologics manufacturing facility in cruiserath ireland we rely on third party to manufacture or supply with all or portion of the active ingredient necessary for to manufacture various product such opdivo sprycel yervoy eliquis orencia baraclude reyataz and the sustiva franchise to maintain stable supply of these product we take variety of action including inventory management and maintenance of additional quantity of material when possible designed to provide for reasonable level of these ingredient to be held by the third party supplier or both that our manufacturing operation are not interrupted an additional protection in some case we take step to maintain an approved back up source where available for example we rely on the capacity of our devens massachusetts facility and the capacity available at our third party contract manufacturer to manufacture orencia in connection with divestiture licensing arrangement or distribution agreement of certain of our product or in certain other circumstance we have entered into agreement under which we have agreed to supply such product to third party in addition to liability that could arise from our failure to supply such product under the agreement these arrangement could require to invest in facility for the production of non strategic product result in additional regulatory filing and obligation or cause an interruption in the manufacturing of our own product our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our product and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from total commitment to quality in all part of our operation including research and development purchasing facility planning manufacturing and distribution we maintain quality assurance procedure relating to the quality and integrity of technical information and production process control of production process involves detailed specification for ingredient equipment and facility manufacturing method process packaging material and labeling we perform test at various stage of production process and on the final product to ensure that the product meet regulatory requirement and our standard these test may involve chemical and physical chemical analysis microbiological testing or combination of these along with other analysis quality control is provided by business unit site quality assurance group that monitor existing manufacturing procedure and system used by our subsidiary and third party supplier regulationour facility and operation are subject to extensive and foreign law and regulation relating to

issuing authority our environment health and safety group monitor our operation around the world providing with an overview of regulatory requirement and overseeing the implementation of our standard for compliance we also incur operating and capital cost for such matter on an ongoing basis which were not material for and in addition we invested in project that reduce resource use of energy and water although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental health and safety requirement and the permit required for our operation we nevertheless could incur additional cost including civil or criminal fine or penalty clean up cost or third party claim for property damage or personal injury for violation or liability under these law many of our current and

and negatively affect our business prospect financial condition operating result or credit rating which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline additional risk and uncertainty not presently known to or risk that we currently consider immaterial could also impair our operation or financial condition the public announcement of data from our clinical study or those of our competitor or news of any development related to our or our competitor io product or late stage compound may cause significant volatility in our stock price and depending on the news may result in an adverse impact on our business financial condition or result of operation if the development of any of our key io compound whether alone or part of combination therapy is delayed or discontinued our stock price could decline significantly and there may be an adverse impact on our business financial condition or result of operation we are focusing our effort and resource in certain disease area with our more focused portfolio investor are placing heightened scrutiny on some of our product or late stage compound in particular opdivo is an important asset in our io portfolio during we announced multiple regulatory milestone for opdivo we also however encountered significant setback in first line lung cancer with the announcement of the negative result of checkmate and we announced we would not pursue an accelerated regulatory pathway for the combination of opdivo yervoy which had negative impact on our stock price in we expect to receive further news from ongoing clinical trial and health authority for several new potential indication the announcement of data from our clinical study or those of our competitor or news of any development related to our or our competitor io product or late stage compound such opdivo may cause significant volatility in our stock price and depending on the news may result in an adverse impact on our business financial condition or result of operation furthermore the announcement of any negative or unexpected data or the discontinuation of development of any of our key io compound whether alone or part of combination therapy any delay in our anticipated timeline for filing for regulatory approval or significant advancement of competitor may cause our stock price to decline significantly and may have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or result of operation there is no assurance that data from our clinical study will support filing for regulatory approval or that our key io compound may prove to be effective or effective other competing compound or even if approved that any of our key io compound will become commercially successful for all approved indication we depend on several key product for most of our revenue cash flow and earnings we have historically derived majority of our revenue and earnings from several key product and while we are not heavily dependent on one or two product in past year our dependence on the profitability of certain product is likely to continue we expect that growth product such opdivo and eliquis will become an increasingly important part of our revenue base reduction in revenue from one of these product could have an adverse impact our revenue cash flow and earnings we may experience difficulty or delay in the development and commercialization of new product compound or product may appear promising in development but fail to reach market within the expected or optimal timeframe or at all in addition product extension or additional indication may not be approved developing and commercializing new compound and product include inherent risk and uncertainty including due to efficacy and safety concern delayed or denied regulatory approval delay or challenge with producing product on commercial scale or excessive cost to manufacture them ii failure to enter into or implement optimal alliance for the development and or commercialization of new product iii failure to maintain consistent scope and variety of promising late stage product iv failure of one or more of our product to achieve or maintain commercial viability and change in regulatory approval process may cause delay or denial of new product approval regulatory approval delay are especially common when product is expected to have risk evaluation and mitigation strategy required by the fda to address significant risk benefit issue the inability to bring product to market or significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of new product could negatively impact our revenue and earnings in addition if certain acquired pipeline program including iprd are canceled or we believe their commercial prospect have been reduced we may recognize material non cash impairment charge for those program finally losing key molecule and intermediary or our compound library through natural or man made disaster or act of sabotage could negatively impact the product development cycle face intense competition from other manufacturer including for both innovative medicine and lower priced generic product bm is dependent on the market access uptake and expansion for marketed brand new product introduction new indication product extension and co promotional activity with alliance partner to deliver future growth competition is keen and includes lower priced generic and increasingly aggressive generic commercialization tactic ii lower price for other company product real or perceived superior efficacy benefit or safety risk profile or other differentiating factor iii technological advance and patent attained by our competitor iv clinical study result from our product or competitor product that affect the value proposition for our product business combination among our competitor and major third party payer and vi competing interest for external partnership to develop and bring new product to market if we are unable to compete successfully against our competitor product in the marketplace this could have material negative impact on our revenue and earnings litigation claiming infringement of intellectual property may adversely affect our future revenue and operating earnings third party may claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require to enter into license agreement which may not be available on commercially reasonable term successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject to significant damage or an injunction preventing the manufacture sale or use of the affected product or product any of these event could have material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition adverse outcome in other legal matter could negatively affect our business current or future lawsuit claim proceeding and government investigation could preclude or delay the commercialization of our product or could adversely affect our operation profitability liquidity or financial condition after any possible insurance recovery where available such legal matter include intellectual property dispute ii adverse decision in litigation including product liability and commercial case iii anti bribery regulation such the foreign corrupt practice act or uk bribery act including compliance with ongoing reporting obligation to the government resulting from any settlement iv recall or withdrawal of pharmaceutical product or forced closing of manufacturing plant the failure to fulfill obligation under supply contract with the government and other customer vi product pricing and promotional matter vii lawsuit and claim asserting or investigation into violation of security antitrust federal and state pricing consumer protection data privacy and other law viii environmental health safety and sustainability matter and ix tax liability resulting from assessment from tax authority we could lose market exclusivity of product earlier than expected in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry the majority of an innovative product commercial value is realized during it market exclusivity period in the and in some other country when market exclusivity expires and generic version are approved and marketed or when biosimilars are introduced even if only for competing product there are usually very substantial and rapid decline in product revenue market exclusivity for our product is based upon patent right and certain regulatory form of exclusivity the scope of our patent right varies from country to country and may also be dependent on the availability of meaningful legal remedy in country the failure to obtain patent and other intellectual property right or limitation on the use or loss of such right could be material to in some country including certain eu member state basic patent protection for our product may not exist because certain country did not historically offer the right to obtain specific type of patent and or we or our licensors did not file in those country in addition the patent environment can be unpredictable and the validity and enforceability of patent can not be predicted with certainty absent relevant patent protection for product once the data exclusivity period expires generic version can be approved and marketed generic and biosimilar product manufacturer well other group seeking financial gain are also increasingly seeking to challenge patent before they expire and we could face earlier than expected competition for any product at any time patent covering our key product have been and are likely to continue to be subject to patent litigation for example in february one of the eu patent for sprycel wa revoked by the opposition division of the epo result we may experience decline in european revenue in the second half of refer to item financial statement note legal proceeding and contingency for further information in some case manufacturer may seek regulatory approval by submitting their own clinical trial data to obtain marketing approval or choose to launch generic product at risk before the expiration of the applicable patent and or before the final resolution of related patent litigation there is no assurance that particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full time period that appears in the estimate disclosed in this form or that we assume when we provide our financial guidance in addition some country such india are allowing competitor to manufacture and sell competing generic product which negatively impact the protection afforded the company lower priced biosimilars for bm biologic product or competing biologics could negatively impact our volume and price pricing pressure and other restriction in the and abroad from mcos institutional purchaser and government agency and program among others could negatively affect our revenue and profit margin our product continue to be subject to increasing pressure across the portfolio from market access pricing and discounting and other restriction in the the eu and other region around the world including from rule and practice of mcos and institutional and governmental purchaser ii judicial decision and change in law and regulation for federal healthcare program such medicare and medicaid and other government action and inquiry iii the potential impact of change to pharmaceutical reimbursement and increased pricing pressure from medicare part formulary medicare part reimbursement rate to physician well commercial formulary in general iv reimbursement delay government price erosion mechanism across europe and in other country resulting in deflation for pharmaceutical product pricing vi collection delay or failure to pay in government funded public hospital outside the vii the impact on pricing from parallel trade across border viii other development in technology and or industry practice that could impact the reimbursement policy and practice of third party payer and ix inhibited market access due to real or perceived difference in value proposition for our product compared to competing product change in or foreign law and regulation including tax regulation may negatively affect our revenue and profit margin we could become subject to new government law and regulation which could negatively affect our business our operating result and the financial condition of our company such additional healthcare reform initiative in the or in other country including additional mandatory discount or fee ii changing tax rate changing the tax base including limiting phasing out or eliminating deduction or tax credit taxing certain excess income from intellectual property changing rule for earnings repatriation and changing other tax law in the or other country iii new law regulation and judicial or other governmental decision affecting pricing drug reimbursement receivable payment and access or marketing within or across jurisdiction iv change in intellectual property law change in accounting standard vi increasing data privacy regulation and enforcement vii emerging and new global regulatory requirement for reporting payment and other value transfer to healthcare professional and viii the potential impact of importation restriction legislative and or other regulatory change third party royalty represent significant percentage of our pretax income and operating cash flow we have entered into several arrangement which entitle to potential royalty from third party for out licensed intellectual property commercialization right and sale based contingent proceeds related to the divestiture of business in many of these arrangement we have minimal if any continuing involvement that contribute to the financial success of those activity royalty have continued to represent significant percentage of our pretax income including royalty related to the divestiture of our diabetes business including the transfer of certain future royalty right pertaining to amylin product sale our sanofi alliance out licensed intellectual property and contingent proceeds resulting from the erbitux business pretax income generated from royalty were approximately billion in our pretax income could be adversely affected if the royalty stream decline in future period failure to execute our business strategy could adversely impact our growth and profitability our strategy is focused on delivering innovative transformational medicine to patient if we are unable to successfully execute on this strategy this could negatively impact our future result of operation and market capitalization in connection with this strategy we recently announced an evolution to our operating model to focus on investment in commercial opportunity against key brand and market accelerate the pipeline streamline operation and realign manufacturing capability that broaden biologics capability among other thing our ability to successfully execute our operating model evolution could impact our result for example if we are not able to achieve the cost saving we expect this could negatively impact our operating margin and earnings result in addition we may not be able to consistently maintain rich pipeline through internal program or transaction with third party to support future revenue growth competition among pharmaceutical company for acquisition and product licensing opportunity is intense and we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition target or licensing partner at reasonable price or successfully execute such transaction if we are unable to support and grow our marketed product successfully execute the launch of newly approved product advance our late stage pipeline manage change and operating model evolution issue and manage our cost effectively our operating result and financial condition could be negatively impacted failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel could affect our ability to successfully develop and commercialize product our success is largely dependent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific technical and management personnel well personnel with expertise in clinical governmental regulation and commercialization competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense we can not be sure that we will be able to attract and retain quality personnel or that the cost of so will not materially increase business or asset we acquire in the future may underperform and we may not be able to successfully integrate them into our existing business we may continue to support our pipeline with compound or product obtained through licensing and acquisition future revenue profit and cash flow of an acquired company product technology and pipeline candidate may not materialize due to lower product uptake delayed or missed pipeline opportunity the inability to capture expected synergy increased competition safety concern regulatory issue supply chain problem or other factor beyond our control substantial difficulty cost and delay could result from integrating our acquisition including for manufacturing distribution sale marketing promotion and information technology activity ii policy procedure process control and compliance iii company culture iv compensation structure and other human resource activity and tax consideration we could experience difficulty and delay in the manufacturing distribution and sale of our product our product supply and related patient access could be negatively impacted by among other thing product seizure or recall or forced closing of

defined exception to limit sale of all product sold to our direct customer including wholesaler distributor hospital retail outlet pharmacy and government purchaser based on expected demand or on amount that do not exceed approximately one month of inventory on hand without making timely public disclosure of any change in practice we also agreed in the consent to certain measure that we have implemented including establishing formal review and certification process of our annual and quarterly report filed with the sec establishing business risk and disclosure group retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help engineer our accounting and financial reporting process publicly disclosing any sale incentive offered to direct customer for the purpose of inducing them to purchase product in excess of expected demand and ensuring that our budget process give appropriate weight to input that come from the bottom to the top and not from the top to the bottom and adequately documenting that process we have established company wide policy to limit our sale to direct customer for the purpose of complying with the consent this policy includes the adoption of various procedure to monitor and limit sale to direct customer in accordance with the term of the consent these procedure include governance process to escalate to appropriate management level potential question or concern regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such question or concern in addition compliance with the policy is monitored on regular basis we maintain imas with our pharmaceutical wholesaler which account for nearly of our gross revenue under the current term of the imas our wholesaler customer provide with weekly information with respect to month on hand product level inventory and the amount of out movement of product the three largest wholesaler currently account for approximately of our gross revenue the inventory information received from our wholesaler together with our internal information is used to estimate month on hand product level inventory at these wholesaler we estimate month on hand product inventory level for our business wholesaler customer other than the three largest wholesaler by extrapolating from the month on hand calculated for the three largest wholesaler in contrast our non business ha significantly more direct customer limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out movement information and the reliability of third party demand information where available varies widely accordingly we rely on variety of method to estimate month on hand product level inventory for these business unit we believe the above described procedure provide reasonable basis to ensure compliance with the consent in addition previously disclosed in october the company reached civil settlement with the sec of alleged fcpa violation in which the company agreed to pay approximately million in disgorgement penalty and interest part of the settlement the company also agreed to two year self monitoring period of reporting to the government and is maintaining procedure to ensure

policiesthe preparation of financial statement requires the use of estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability and the reported amount of revenue and expense our critical accounting policy are those that significantly impact our financial condition and result of operation and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgment often result of the need to make estimate about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain because of this uncertainty actual result may vary from these estimate revenue recognitionour accounting policy for revenue recognition ha substantial impact on reported result and relies on certain estimate revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the sale price is fixed or determinable collectability is reasonably assured and title and substantially all of the risk and reward of ownership have transferred generally upon shipment except in certain eu market which doe not occur until delivery of the product to the customer in we deferred approximately million invoiced for daklinza under an early access program in france portion of this amount wa recognized revenue in when final

related good or service are delivered limited to the consideration that is not contingent upon future deliverable consideration associated with contingent milestone and royalty are allocated among the underlying element if and when the amount are determined to be payable to bm gross to net adjustmentsthe following category of gross to net adjustment involve significant estimate judgment and information obtained from external source refer to total revenue above for further discussion and analysis of each significant category of gross to net sale adjustment charge back and cash discountsour business participates in program with government entity the most significant of which are the department of defense and the department of veteran affair and other party including covered entity under the drug pricing program whereby pricing on product is extended below wholesaler list price to participating entity these entity purchase product through wholesaler at the lower program price and the wholesaler then charge the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower program price account receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of unprocessed charge back claim attributable to sale typically within two to four week time lag in the and certain other country cash discount are offered an incentive for prompt payment generally approximating of the sale price account receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of unprocessed cash discount typically within one month time lag medicaid and medicare rebatesour business participates in state government

regulation for individual non country well rebate offered to managed healthcare organization in the to lesser extent the non program include several different pricing scheme such cost cap volume discount outcome based pricing scheme and pricing claw back that are based on sale of individual company or an aggregation of all company participating in specific market the estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebate and discount is presented liability estimated return for established product are determined after considering historical experience and other factor including level of inventory in the distribution channel estimated shelf life product recall product discontinuance price change of competitive product introduction of generic product introduction of competitive new product and lower demand following the loss of exclusivity the estimated amount for product return is presented liability estimated return for new product are determined after considering historical sale return experience of similar product such those within the same product line similar therapeutic area and or similar distribution model we defer recognition of revenue until the right of return expires sufficient historical experience to estimate sale return is developed in limited circumstance or when insufficient historical experience with product in similar therapeutic area distribution method or other characteristic is available this typically occurs when the new product is not an extension of an existing line of product or when historical experience with product in similar therapeutic category is lacking estimated level of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand are also considered in estimating sale return for new product use of information from external sourcesinformation from external source is used to estimate gross to net adjustment our estimate of inventory at the wholesaler are based on the projected prescription demand based sale for our product and historical inventory experience well our analysis of third party information including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesaler with respect to their inventory level and sell through to customer and third party market research data and our internal information the inventory information received from wholesaler is product of their recordkeeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediary to they sell such retailer and hospital we have also continued the practice of combining retail and mail prescription volume on retail equivalent basis we use this methodology for internal demand forecast we also use information from external source to identify prescription trend patient demand and average selling price our estimate are subject to inherent limitation of estimate that rely on third party information certain third party information wa itself in the form of estimate and reflect other limitation including lag between the date of which third party information is generated and the date on which we receive third party information retirement benefitsaccounting for pension and postretirement benefit plan requires actuarial valuation based on significant assumption for discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan asset in consultation with our actuary these significant assumption and others such salary growth retirement turnover healthcare trend and mortality rate are evaluated and selected based on expectation or actual experience during each remeasurement date pension expense could vary within range of outcome and have material effect on reported earnings projected benefit obligation and future cash funding actual result in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factor the yield on high quality corporate bond that coincides with the cash flow of the plan estimated payouts is used in determining the discount rate the citi pension discount curve is used for the plan the present value of benefit obligation at december for the pension plan wa determined using discount rate if the assumed discount rate used in determining the pension plan projected benefit obligation at december wa reduced by an additional the projected benefit obligation would increase by approximately million the expected long term rate of return on plan asset is estimated considering expected return for individual asset class with input from external advisor we also consider long term historical return including actual performance compared to benchmark for similar investment the plan pension expense for wa determined using expected long term rate of return on plan asset if the expected long term rate of return on plan asset used in determining the plan pension expense for wa reduced by such expense would increase by million for more detailed discussion on retirement benefit refer to item financial statement note pension postretirement and postemployment liability combination and divestituresgoodwill and other intangible asset acquired in business combination licensing and other transaction were billion representing of total asset at december accounting for transaction business combination and divestiture is significantly different than asset acquisition and divestiture for example acquired iprd is capitalized for business combination and expensed for asset acquisition and the fair value of contingent consideration and goodwill are only recognized in business combination transaction likewise when portion of reporting unit that constitutes business is divested goodwill associated with that business is included in the carrying value of the business in determining the gain or loss derecognition of goodwill doe not occur in asset disposition result it is important to determine whether business or an asset or group of asset is acquired or divested business is defined in asc business combination an integrated set of input and process that are capable of generating output that have the ability to provide return to it investor or owner typical input include long lived asset including intangible asset or right to use long lived asset intellectual property and the ability to obtain access to required resource typical process include strategic operational and resource management process that are typically documented or evident through an organized workforce we consider all of the above factor when determining whether business wa acquired or divested well the compound development phase if no commercial product are involved for example in evaluating our acquisition of cormorant and padlock in cardioxyl and flexus in and ipierian in we concluded that no significant process were transferred to thus the transaction were accounted for asset acquisition result the amount allocated to the lead investigational compound were expensed and not capitalized in addition contingent consideration from potential development regulatory approval and sale based milestone and sale based royalty were not included in the purchase price refer to item financial statement note acquisition and divestiture for further discussion on our acquisition similarly in evaluating our divestiture of our investigational hiv medicine business and the business comprising the alliance with reckitt in erbitux ixempra and the business comprising the alliance with the medicine company and valeant pharmaceutical international inc in and our diabetes business to astrazeneca in we concluded that all necessary input and process were transferred and consequently the transaction were accounted for sale of business which resulted in the allocation of goodwill million in million in and million in to the carrying value of the business in determining the gain on sale contingent proceeds related to divestiture are not recognized until realized valuation process are also required for certain multiple element arrangement and include determination of judgmental and complex matter discussed above for example bm purchased warrant in that give bm the exclusive right to acquire promedior which required the determination of the best estimated selling price of the two separate element identified in the transaction the warrant and the clinical development service similarly the divestiture of the diabetes business to astrazeneca in required the determination of the best estimated selling price of several element including the business supply and development agreement including the appropriate mark ups and the estimated fair value of the manufacturing facility refer to item financial statement note alliance for further discussion on both transaction impairmentother intangible asset including iprdother intangible asset were billion at december including license million of which million is allocated to unapproved product developed technology right million capitalized software million and iprd million intangible asset are assessed for impairment whenever current fact or circumstance warrant review although iprd is assessed at least annually intangible asset are highly vulnerable to impairment charge particularly newly acquired asset for recently launched product or iprd these asset are initially measured at fair value and therefore any reduction in expectation used in the valuation could potentially lead to impairment some of the more common potential risk leading to impairment include competition earlier than expected loss of exclusivity pricing pressure adverse regulatory change or clinical trial result delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval and additional development cost inability to achieve expected synergy higher operating cost change in tax law and other macro economic change the complexity in estimating the fair value of intangible asset in connection with an impairment test is similar to the initial valuation considering the high risk nature of research and development and the industry success rate of bringing developmental compound to market iprd impairment charge are likely to occur in future period we recognized million charge in for bm which wa in phase ii development for treatment of ipf and million in including million charge for peginterferon lambda which wa in phase iii development for treatment of hcv for discussion on iprd impairment refer to item financial statement note goodwill and other intangible asset plant and equipmentproperty plant and equipment is tested for impairment whenever current fact or circumstance require review including whether it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of prior to it estimated remaining useful life additionally these long lived asset are periodically reviewed to determine if any change in fact or circumstance would result in change to the estimated useful life of the asset possibly resulting in the acceleration of depreciation if such circumstance exist an estimate of undiscounted future cash flow generated by the asset or the appropriate grouping of asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists at it lowest level of identifiable cash flow if an asset is determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset fair value and it carrying value expectation of future cash flow are subject to change based upon the near and long term production volume and margin generated by the asset well any potential alternative future use accelerated depreciation and other related charge for certain manufacturing and facility were million in million in and million in additional charge will continue to occur result of the company restructuring action announced in the fourth quarter of contingenciesin the normal course of business we are subject to contingency such legal proceeding and claim arising out of our business that cover wide range of matter including among others government investigation shareholder lawsuit product and environmental liability contractual claim and tax matter we recognize accrual for such contingency when it is probable that liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated these estimate are subject to uncertainty that are difficult to predict and such actual result could vary from these estimate for discussion on contingency refer to item financial statement note accounting policy contingency note income tax and note legal proceeding and contingency income taxesvaluation allowance are recognized to reduce deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that tax benefit will not be realized the assessment of whether or not valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment

tax are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiary expected to be reinvested indefinitely offshore prior to the mead johnson split off in the following transaction occurred an internal spin off of mead johnson share while still owned by ii conversion of mead johnson class share to class share and iii conversion of mead johnson company to limited liability company these transaction well the split off of mead johnson through the exchange offer qualify tax exempt transaction under the internal revenue code based upon private letter ruling received from the internal revenue service related to the conversion of mead johnson class share to class share and outside legal opinion certain assumption representation and covenant by mead johnson were relied upon regarding the future conduct of it business and other matter which could affect the tax treatment of the exchange for example the current tax law generally creates presumption that the exchange would be taxable to if mead johnson or it shareholder were to engage in transaction that result in or greater change in it stock ownership during four year period beginning two year before the exchange offer unless it is established that the exchange offer were not part of plan or series of related transaction to effect such change in ownership if the internal spin off or exchange offer were determined not to qualify tax exempt transaction the transaction could be subject to tax if the exchange wa taxable sale by at market value addition negative basis or ela existed in our investment in stock of mead johnson prior to these transaction we received an opinion from outside legal counsel to the effect that it is more likely than not that we eliminated the ela part of these transaction and do not have taxable income with respect to the ela the tax law in this area is complex and it is possible that even if the internal spin off and the exchange offer is tax exempt under the internal revenue code the irs could assert that we have additional taxable income for the period with respect to the ela we could be exposed to additional tax if this were to occur based upon our understanding of the internal revenue code and opinion from outside legal counsel tax reserve of million wa established reducing the gain on disposal of mead johnson included in discontinued operation in we agreed to certain tax related indemnity with mead johnson set forth in the tax sharing agreement including certain tax related to it business prior to the completion of the ipo and created part of the

related to the acquisition of mead johnson stock or asset liability are established for possible assessment by tax authority resulting from known tax exposure including but not limited to transfer pricing matter tax credit and deductibility of certain expense such liability represent reasonable provision for tax ultimately expected to be paid and may need to be adjusted over time more

depreciationexpenditures for addition renewal and improvement are capitalized at cost depreciation is computed on straight line method based on the estimated useful life of the related asset ranging from to year for building and to year for machinery equipment and fixture impairment of long lived assetscurrent fact or circumstance are periodically evaluated to determine if the carrying value of depreciable asset to be held and used may not be recoverable if such circumstance exist an estimate of undiscounted future cash flow generated by the long lived asset or appropriate grouping of asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists at it lowest level of identifiable cash flow if an asset is determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset fair value and it carrying value an estimate of the asset fair value is based on quoted market price in active market if available if quoted market price are not available

or performing quantitative analysis in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of net asset are below their carrying amount example of qualitative factor assessed in include our share price financial performance compared to budget long term financial plan macroeconomic industry and market condition well the substantial excess of fair value over the carrying value of net asset from the annual impairment test performed in prior year each relevant factor is assessed both individually and in the aggregate iprd is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently if event occur or circumstance change that would indicate potential reduction in the fair value of the asset below their carrying value if the carrying value of iprd is determined to exceed the fair value an impairment loss is recognized for the difference finite lived intangible asset are tested for impairment when fact or circumstance suggest that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable if the carrying value exceeds the projected undiscounted pretax cash flow of the intangible asset an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the estimated

recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised good or service to customer the new standard and it subsequent amendment that were issued will replace most of the existing revenue recognition standard in gaap when it becomes effective on january five step model will be utilized to achieve the core principle identify the customer contract identify the contract performance obligation determine the transaction price allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation and recognize revenue when or performance obligation is satisfied the new standard can be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of the change recognized at the date of the initial application in retained earnings disclosure regarding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flow from customer contract will also be required the company assessment of the new standard impact is substantially complete based on our current contract we currently believe the timing of recognizing revenue for the typical net product sale to our customer will not significantly change however the new standard will no longer require the transaction price to be fixed or determinable and certain variable consideration might be recognized prior to the occurrence or resolution of the contingent event subject to revenue reversal constraint result certain revenue previously deferred under the current standard because the transaction price wa not fixed or determinable early access program will be accounted for variable consideration and might be recognized earlier provided such term are sufficient to reliably estimate the ultimate price expected to be realized in addition future royalty related to certain alliance arrangement sanofi and japan erbitux arrangement disclosed in note alliance will be estimated and recognized prior to the third party sale occurring provided it is not probable that the estimated amount would be reversed in the future however the timing of royalty sale based milestone and other form of contingent consideration resulting from the divestiture of
