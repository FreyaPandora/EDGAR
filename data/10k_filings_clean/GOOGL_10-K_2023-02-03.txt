terminate their contract with at any time these partner may not continue to do business with if we do not create more value of contentsalphabet inc such increased number of user or customer new sale lead increased brand awareness or more effective monetization than their available alternative change to our advertising policy and data privacy practice well change to other company advertising and or data privacy practice have in the past and may in the future affect the advertising that we are able to provide in addition technology have been developed that make customized ad more difficult or

intensely competitive our business face changing technology shifting user need and frequent introduction of rival product and service to compete successfully we must accurately anticipate technology development and deliver innovative relevant and useful product service and technology in timely manner our business evolve the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass wider range of product and service we must continue to invest significant resource in including through acquisition in order to enhance our technology and new and existing product and service we have many competitor in different industry our current and potential domestic and international competitor range from large and established company to emerging start ups some competitor have longer operating history and well established relationship in various sector they can use their experience and resource in way that could affect our competitive position including by making acquisition continuing to invest heavily in and in talent initiating intellectual property and competition claim whether or not meritorious and continuing to compete for user advertiser customer and content provider further discrepancy in enforcement of existing law may enable our lesser known competitor to aggressively interpret those law without commensurate scrutiny thereby affording them competitive advantage our competitor may also be able to innovate and provide product and service faster than we can or may foresee the need for product and service our financial condition and operating result may also suffer if our product and service are not responsive to the evolving need and desire of our user advertiser publisher customer and content provider new and existing technology continue to develop competitor and new entrant may be able to offer experience that are or that are seen to be substantially similar to or better than ours these technology could reduce usage of our product and service and force to compete in different way and expend significant resource to develop and operate equal or better product and service competitor success in providing compelling product and service or in attracting and retaining user advertiser publisher customer and content provider could harm our financial condition and operating result our ongoing investment in new business product service and technology is inherently

operation and the use of alternative investment governance or compensation structure that may fail to adequately align incentive across the company or otherwise accomplish their objective within google service we continue to invest heavily in hardware including our smartphones home device and wearable which is highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new product and service rapid adoption of technological advancement by competitor short product life cycle evolving industry standard continual improvement in performance characteristic and price and feature sensitivity on the part of consumer and business there can be no assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively of contentsalphabet inc within google cloud we devote significant resource to develop and deploy our enterprise ready cloud service including google cloud platform and google workspace we are incurring cost to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing service invest in cybersecurity and hire talent particularly to support and scale our sale force at the same time our competitor are rapidly developing and deploying cloud based service pricing and delivery model are competitive and constantly evolving and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objective further our business with public sector customer may present additional risk including regulatory compliance risk for instance we may be subject to government audit and cost review and any failure to comply or any deficiency found may expose to legal financial and or reputational risk evolving law and regulation may require to make new capital investment build new product and seek partner to deliver localized service in other country and we may not be able to meet sovereign operating requirement within other bet we are investing significantly in the area of health life science and transportation among others these investment area face intense competition from large experienced and well funded competitor and our offering many of which involve the development of new and emerging technology may not be successful or be able to compete effectively or operate at sufficient level of profitability in addition new and evolving product and service including those that use ai require significant investment and raise ethical technological legal regulatory and other challenge which may negatively affect our brand and demand for our product and service all of these investment area are inherently risky no assurance can be given that such strategy and offering will be successful or will not harm our reputation financial condition and operating result our revenue growth rate could decline over time and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future our revenue growth rate could decline over time result of number of factor including change in the device and modality used to access our product and service change in geographic mix deceleration or decline in advertiser spending competition customer usage and demand for our product decrease in our pricing of our product and service ongoing product and policy change and shift to lower priced product and service in addition we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from variety of factor such the continued expansion of our business into new field including product and service such hardware google cloud and subscription product well significant investment in other bet all of which may have margin lower than those we generate from advertising in particular margin on our hardware product have had and may continue to have an adverse affect on our consolidated margin due to pressure on pricing and higher cost of sale we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin from increasing regulation increasing competition and increasing cost for many aspect of our business further certain of our cost and expense are generally le variable in nature and may not correlate to change in revenue additionally in conjunction with our effort to engineer cost we may not be able to execute these effort in timely manner or these effort may not be successful due to these factor and the evolving nature of our business our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance for additional information see trend in our business and financial effect and revenue and monetization metric in part ii item of this annual report on form our intellectual property right are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our product service and brand well affect our ability to compete our patent trademark trade secret copyright and other intellectual property right are important asset for various event outside of our control pose threat to our intellectual property right well to our product service and technology for example effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our product and service are distributed or made available through the internet also the effort we have taken to protect our proprietary right may not be sufficient or effective although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovation it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovation moreover we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovation that later turn out to be important there is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable we also seek to maintain certain intellectual property trade secret the secrecy of such trade secret and other sensitive information could be compromised which could cause to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secret we also face risk associated with our trademark for example there is risk that the word google could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word search some court have ruled that google is protectable trademark but it is possible that other court particularly those outside of the of contentsalphabet inc may reach different determination if this happens we could lose protection for this trademark which could result in other people using the word google to refer to their own product thus diminishing our brand any significant impairment of our intellectual property right could harm our business and our ability to compete also protecting our intellectual property right is costly and time consuming any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating result our business depends on strong brand and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our base of user advertiser customer content provider and other partner our strong brand have significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing the brand within google service google cloud and other bet increase our

practice by advertiser or otherwise to adequately address user concern our user may lose confidence in our brand furthermore failure to maintain and enhance our brand could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating result our success will depend largely on our ability to remain technology leader and continue to provide high quality trustworthy innovative product and service that are truly useful and play valuable role in range of setting we face number of manufacturing and supply chain risk that could harm our business financial condition and operating result we face number of risk related to manufacturing and supply chain management which could affect our ability to supply both our product and our service we rely on contract manufacturer to manufacture or assemble our hardware product and server and networking equipment used in our technical infrastructure and we may supply the contract manufacturer with component to assemble the hardware product and equipment we also rely on other company to participate in the distribution of our product and service our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these company with the necessary capability or capacity on reasonable term or if those we engage fail to meet their obligation whether due to financial difficulty or other reason or make adverse change in the pricing or other material term of our arrangement with them we have experienced and or may in the future experience supply shortage price increase and or longer lead time that could negatively affect our operation driven by raw material component availability manufacturing capacity labor shortage industry allocation logistics capacity inflation foreign currency exchange rate tariff sanction and export control trade dispute and barrier geopolitical tension armed conflict natural disaster or pandemic the effect of climate change such sea level rise drought flooding heat wave wildfire and resultant air quality effect and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention and increased storm severity power loss and significant change in the financial or business condition of our supplier in addition some of the component we use in our technical infrastructure and our hardware product are available from only one or limited source and we may not be able to find replacement vendor on favorable term in the event of supply chain disruption significant supply interruption that affect or our vendor could delay critical data center upgrade or expansion and delay consumer product availability we may enter into long term contract for material and product that commit to significant term and condition we may face cost for material and product that are not consumed due to market demand technological change changed consumer preference quality product recall and warranty issue for instance because certain of our hardware supply contract have volume based pricing or minimum purchase requirement if the volume of our hardware sale decrease or not reach projected target we could face increased material and manufacturing cost or other financial liability that could make our product more costly per unit to manufacture and harm our financial condition and operating result furthermore certain of our competitor may negotiate more favorable contractual term based on volume and other commitment that may provide them with competitive advantage and may affect our supply our product and service have had and in the future may have quality issue resulting from design manufacturing or operation sometimes these issue may be caused by component we purchase from other of contentsalphabet inc manufacturer or supplier if the quality of our product and service doe not

and in some case to potential disruption resulting from problem experienced by facility operator or disruption result of geopolitical tension and conflict happening in the area some of our system are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning can not account for all eventuality the occurrence of natural disaster or pandemic closure of facility or other unanticipated problem affecting our data center could result in lengthy interruption in our service in addition our product and service are highly technical and complex and have contained in the past and may contain in the future error or vulnerability which could result in interruption in or failure of our service or system any of these incident could impede or prevent from effectively offering product and providing service which could harm our reputation financial condition and operating result our international operation expose to additional risk that could harm our business financial condition and operating result our international operation are significant to our revenue and net income and we plan to continue to grow internationally international revenue accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue in in addition to risk described elsewhere in this section our international operation expose to other risk including the following restriction on foreign ownership and investment and stringent foreign exchange control that might prevent from repatriating cash earned in country outside the import and export requirement tariff and other market access barrier that may prevent or impede from offering product or providing service to particular market or that could limit our ability to source assembly and finished product from particular market and may increase our operating cost longer payment cycle in some country increased credit risk and higher level of payment fraud an evolving foreign policy landscape that may adversely affect our revenue and could subject to new regulatory cost and challenge including new customer requirement in addition to other adverse effect that we are unable to effectively anticipate sanction export control and trade restriction that limit our ability to operate in certain jurisdiction or to comply with local law including result of geopolitical tension or armed conflict such the ongoing conflict in ukraine political unrest conflict and change in governmental regime that may adversely affect demand and usage of our product and service may limit the ability for people in certain area to access and use our product and service or may impede from offering product or providing service to particular market anti corruption law such the foreign corrupt practice act and other local law prohibiting certain payment to government official violation of which could result in civil and criminal penalty of contentsalphabet inc uncertainty regarding regulatory outcome and other liability including uncertainty result of local law insufficient due process and lack of legal precedent and different employee employer relationship existence of work council and labor union and other challenge caused by distance language and cultural difference making it harder to do business in certain jurisdiction because we conduct business in currency other than dollar but report our financial result in dollar we have faced and will continue to face exposure to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate although we hedge portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuation in exchange rate the dollar and foreign currency may adversely affect our revenue and earnings hedging program are also inherently risky and could expose to additional risk that could harm our financial condition and operating result we are exposed to fluctuation in the fair value of our investment and in some instance our financial statement incorporate valuation methodology that are subjective in nature resulting in fluctuation over time the fair value of our investment may in the future be and certain investment have been in the past negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration or loss performance and financial result of the underlying entity foreign exchange rate change in interest rate including change that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rate the effect of new or changing regulation the stock market in general or other factor we measure certain of our non marketable equity and debt security certain other instrument including stock based compensation award settled in the stock of certain other bet and certain asset and liability acquired in business combination at fair value on nonrecurring basis the determination of fair value involves use of appropriate valuation method and certain unobservable input requires management judgment and estimation and may change over time we adjust the carrying value of our non marketable equity security to fair value for observable transaction of identical or similar investment of the same issuer or for impairment all gain and loss on non marketable equity security are recognized in other income expense which increase the volatility of our other income expense the unrealized gain and loss we record from fair value remeasurements of our non marketable equity security in any particular period may differ significantly from the gain or loss we ultimately realize on such investment result of these factor the value of our investment could decline which could harm our financial condition and operating result risk related to our industry people access the internet through variety of platform and device that continue to evolve with the advancement of technology and user preference if manufacturer and user do not widely adopt version of our product and service developed for these interface our business could be harmed people access the internet through growing variety of device such desktop computer mobile phone smartphones laptop and tablet video game

manufacturer may also elect not to include our product on their device in addition search query may be undertaken via voice activated search apps social medium or other platform which could harm our business it is hard to predict the challenge we may encounter in adapting our product and service and developing competitive new product and service we expect to continue to devote significant resource to creating and supporting product and service across multiple platform and device failing to attract and retain substantial number of new device manufacturer supplier distributor developer and user or failing to develop product and technology that work well on new device and platform could harm our business financial condition and operating result and ability to capture future business

result in government and legal exposure seriously harm our reputation brand and business and impair our ability to attract and retain user or customer such incident have occurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the scale and nature of our product and service while there is no guarantee that such incident will not cause significant damage we expect to continue to expend significant resource to maintain security protection that limit the effect of bug theft misuse and security vulnerability or breach we experience cyber attack and other attempt to gain unauthorized access to our system on regular basis cyber attack continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and inherently may be difficult to detect for long period of time we have seen and will continue to see industry wide software supply chain vulnerability such the vulnerability reported in december which could affect our or other party system we expect to continue to experience such incident or vulnerability in the future our effort to address undesirable activity on our platform may also increase the risk of retaliatory attack in addition we face the risk of cyber attack by nation state and state sponsored actor these attack may target or our customer particularly our public sector customer including federal state and local government geopolitical tension or armed conflict such the ongoing conflict in ukraine may increase these risk we may experience security issue whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance system error or vulnerability in our or other party system while we may not determine some of these issue to be material at the time they occur and may remedy them quickly there is no guarantee that these issue will not ultimately result in significant legal financial and reputational harm including government inquiry enforcement action litigation and negative publicity there is also no guarantee that series of issue may not be determined to be material at later date in the aggregate even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence because the technique used to obtain unauthorized access to disable or degrade service provided by or otherwise sabotage system change frequently and often are recognized only after being launched target even taking all reasonable precaution including those required by law we have been unable in the past and may continue to be unable to anticipate or detect attack or vulnerability or implement adequate preventative measure further if any partner with whom we share user or other customer

class action litigation and regulatory action fine and penalty any of the foregoing consequence could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating result while we have dedicated significant resource to privacy and security incident response capability including dedicated worldwide incident response team our response process particularly during time of natural disaster or pandemic may not be adequate may fail to accurately ass the severity of an incident may not be fast enough to prevent or limit harm or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident result we may suffer significant legal reputational or financial exposure which could harm our business financial condition and operating result for additional information see also our risk factor on privacy and data protection regulation under risk related to law regulation and policy below our ongoing investment in safety security and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of our platform and misuse of user data in addition to our effort to prevent and mitigate cyber attack we are making significant investment in safety security and review effort to combat misuse of our service and unauthorized access to user data by third party including investigation and review of platform application that could access the information of user of our service result of these effort we have in the past discovered and may in the future discover incident of unnecessary access to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third party however we may not have discovered and may in

financial result any such development may also subject to additional litigation and regulatory inquiry which could result in monetary penalty and damage divert management time and attention and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight problematic content on our platform including low quality user generated content web spam content farm and other violation of our guideline could affect the quality of our service which could harm our reputation and deter our current and potential user from using our product and service we like others in the industry face violation of our content guideline across our platform including sophisticated attempt by bad actor to manipulate our hosting and advertising system to fraudulently generate revenue or to otherwise generate traffic that doe not represent genuine user interest or intent while we invest significantly in effort to promote high quality and relevant result and to detect and prevent low quality content and invalid traffic we have been unable and may continue to be unable to detect and prevent all such abuse or promote uniformly high quality content many website violate or attempt to violate our guideline including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search result than our search engine assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them such effort have affected and may continue to affect the quality of content on our platform and lead them to display false misleading or undesirable content although english language web spam in our search result ha been reduced and web spam in most other language is limited we expect web spammer will continue to seek inappropriate way to improve their ranking we continuously combat web spam in our search result including through indexing technology that make it harder for spam like le useful web content to rank highly we also continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam on our platform we also face other challenge from low quality and irrelevant content website including content farm which are website that generate large quantity of low quality content to help them improve their search ranking we are continually launching algorithmic change designed to detect and prevent abuse from low quality website we also face other challenge on our platform including violation of our content guideline involving incident such attempted election interference activity that threaten the safety and or well being of our user on or off line and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation if we fail

attention our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by and our user internet access provider may be able to restrict block degrade or charge for access to certain of our product and service which could lead to additional expense and the loss of user and advertiser our product and service depend on the ability of our user to access the internet and certain of our product require significant bandwidth to work effectively currently this access is provided by company that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace including incumbent telephone company cable company mobile communication company and government owned service provider some of these provider have taken or have stated that they may take measure that could degrade disrupt or increase the cost of user access to certain of our product by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offering by charging increased fee to or our user to provide our offering or by providing our competitor preferential access some jurisdiction have adopted regulation prohibiting certain form of discrimination by internet access provider however substantial uncertainty exists in the and elsewhere regarding such protection for example in the federal communication commission repealed net neutrality rule which could permit of contentsalphabet inc internet access provider to restrict block degrade or charge for access to certain of our product and service in addition in some jurisdiction our product and service have been subject to government initiated restriction or blockage these could harm existing key relationship including with our user customer advertiser and or content provider and impair our ability to attract new one harm our reputation and increase cost thereby negatively affecting our business risk related to law regulation and policy we are subject to variety of new existing and changing law and regulation worldwide that could harm our business and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of law and regulation we continue to expand our business we are subject to numerous and foreign law and regulation covering wide variety of subject and our introduction of new business product service and technology will likely continue to subject to additional law and regulation in recent year government around the world have proposed and adopted large number of new law and regulation relevant to the digital economy particularly in the area of data privacy and security competition and online content the cost of compliance with these measure are high and are likely to increase in the future new or changing law and regulation or new interpretation or application of existing law and regulation in manner inconsistent with our practice have resulted in and may continue to result in le useful product and service altered business practice limited ability to pursue certain business model or offer certain product and service substantial cost and civil or criminal liability example include law and regulation regarding competition and technology platform business practice law and regulation focused on large technology platform including the digital market act in the european union eu regulation in south korea and elsewhere that affect google play billing policy fee and business model well regulation under consideration in range of jurisdiction data privacy collection and processing law and regulation further restricting the collection processing and or sharing of user or advertising related data including privacy and data protection law law affecting the processing of child data discussed further below data breach notification law and law limiting data transfer including data localization law copyright and other intellectual property copyright and related law including the eu directive on copyright in the digital single market and european economic area transposition which may introduce new licensing regime increase liability with respect to content uploaded by user or linked to from our platform or create property right in news publication that could require payment to news agency and publisher content moderation various law covering content moderation and removal and related disclosure obligation such the eu digital service act florida senate bill and texas house bill and law and proposed legislation in singapore australia and the united kingdom that impose penalty for failure to remove certain type of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our service and algorithm which may make it harder for service like google search and youtube to detect and deal with low quality deceptive or harmful content consumer protection consumer protection law including the eu new deal for consumer which could result in monetary penalty and create range of new compliance obligation in addition the applicability and scope of these and other law and regulation interpreted by the court remain uncertain and could be interpreted in way that harm our business for example we rely on statutory safe harbor like those set forth in the digital millennium copyright act and section of the communication decency act in the and the commerce directive in europe to protect against liability for various linking caching ranking recommending and hosting activity legislation or court ruling affecting these safe harbor may adversely affect and may impose significant operational challenge there are legislative proposal and pending litigation in the such gonzalez google eu and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for website and online platform we are and may continue to be subject to claim lawsuit regulatory and government investigation enforcement action consent order and other form of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability that could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating result we are subject to claim lawsuit regulatory and government investigation other proceeding and consent order involving competition intellectual property data privacy and security tax and related compliance labor and employment commercial dispute content generated by our user good and service offered by advertiser or publisher using our platform personal injury and other matter we also are subject to variety of claim including of contentsalphabet inc product warranty product liability and consumer protection claim related to product defect among other litigation and we may also be subject to claim involving health and safety hazardous material usage other environmental effect or service disruption or failure claim have been brought and we expect will continue to be brought against for defamation negligence breach of contract copyright and trademark infringement unfair competition unlawful activity tort privacy right violation fraud or other legal theory based on the nature and content of information available on or via our service or due to our involvement in hosting transmitting marketing branding or providing access to content created by third party for example the department of justice various state and other plaintiff have filed several antitrust lawsuit about various aspect of our business including our advertising technology and practice the operation and distribution of google search and the operation and distribution of the android operating system and play store other regulatory agency in the and around the world including competition enforcer consumer protection agency and data protection authority have challenged and may continue to challenge our business practice and compliance with law and regulation we are cooperating with these investigation and defending litigation where appropriate various law regulation investigation enforcement lawsuit and regulatory action have in the past and may in the future result in substantial fine and penalty injunctive relief ongoing monitoring and auditing obligation change to our product and service alteration to our business model and operation and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequence all of which could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating result any of these legal proceeding could result in legal cost diversion of management resource negative publicity and other harm to our business estimating liability for our pending litigation is complex fact intensive process that requires significant judgment and the amount we are ultimately liable for may exceed our estimate the resolution of one or more such proceeding ha resulted in and may in the future result in additional substantial fine penalty injunction and other sanction that could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating result privacy data protection and data usage regulation are complex and rapidly evolving area any failure or alleged failure to comply with these law could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating result authority around the world have adopted and are considering number of legislative and regulatory proposal concerning data protection data usage and encryption of user data adverse legal ruling legislation or regulation have resulted in and may continue to result in

operating result these law and regulation are evolving and subject to interpretation and compliance obligation could cause to incur substantial cost or harm the quality and operation of our product and service in way that harm our business example of these law include the general data protection regulation and the united kingdom general data protection regulation which apply to all of our activity conducted from an establishment in the eu or the united kingdom respectively or related to product and service that we offer to eu or the united kingdom user or customer respectively or the monitoring of their behavior in the eu or the uk respectively various state and foreign privacy law and regulation such the california consumer privacy act of the california privacy right act the virginia consumer data protection act the colorado privacy act the connecticut data privacy act and the utah consumer privacy act all of which give new data privacy right to their respective resident including in california private right of action in the event of data breach resulting from our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedure and practice and impose significant

price change of on our december balance would decrease the fair value of marketable equity security by million from time to time we may enter into derivative to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity security our non marketable equity security not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for observable transaction for identical or similar investment of the same issuer or impairment referred to the measurement alternative the fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an indication of the current fair value of the balance sheet date these investment especially those that are in the early stage are inherently risky because the technology or product these company have under development are typically in the early phase and may never materialize and they may experience decline in financial condition which could result in loss of substantial part of our investment in these company valuation of our equity investment in private company are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data and observable transaction at lower valuation could result in significant loss in addition global economic condition could result in additional volatility the success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of investment through liquidity event such public offering acquisition private sale or other market event change in the valuation of non marketable equity security may not directly correlate with change in valuation of marketable equity security of december and the carrying value of our non marketable equity security which were accounted for under the measurement
