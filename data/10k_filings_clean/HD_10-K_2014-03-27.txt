the aggregate market value of these publicly traded senior note of february wa approximately billion although we have international operating entity our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is not significant to our financial condition or result of operation impact of inflation deflation and changing priceswe have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity product we do not believe that changing price for commodity have had material effect on our net sale or result of operation although we can not precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operation we do not believe inflation and deflation have had material effect on our financial condition or result of operation critical accounting policiesour significant accounting policy are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statement the following discussion address our most critical accounting policy which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and result of operation and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumption or complex estimate revenueswe recognize revenue net of estimated return and sale tax at the time the customer take possession of merchandise or receives service we estimate the liability for sale return based on our historical return level we believe that our estimate for sale return is an accurate reflection of future return we have never recorded significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sale return however if these estimate are significantly below the actual amount our sale could be adversely impacted when we receive payment from customer before the customer ha taken possession of the merchandise or the service ha been performed the amount received is recorded deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated of contentsbalance sheet until the sale or service is complete we also record deferred revenue for the sale of gift card and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift card in net sale merchandise inventoriesour merchandise inventory are stated at the lower of cost first in first out or market with approximately valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under cost method retailer like with many different type of merchandise at low unit cost and large number of transaction frequently use the retail inventory method under the retail inventory method merchandise inventory are stated at cost which is determined by applying cost to retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventory our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market condition our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market we evaluate our inventory valued under cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market the valuation allowance for merchandise inventory valued under cost method wa not material to our consolidated financial statement of the end of fiscal or independent physical inventory count or cycle count are taken on regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amount reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statement for merchandise inventory are properly stated during the period between physical inventory count in our store we accrue for estimated loss related to shrink on store by store basis shrink or in the case of excess inventory swell is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory shrink may occur due to theft loss inaccurate record for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of good among other thing we estimate shrink percent of net sale using the average shrink result from the previous two physical inventory the estimate are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink result and current trend in the business actual shrink result not vary materially from estimated amount for fiscal or self insurancewe have established liability for certain loss related to general liability including product liability worker compensation employee group medical and automobile claim for which we are self insured our self insured retention or deductible applicable for each claim involving general liability worker compensation and automobile liability is limited to million million and million respectively we do not have any stop loss limit for self insured employee group medical claim our liability represent estimate of the ultimate cost for claim incurred of the balance sheet date the estimated liability are not discounted and are established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimate the liability are reviewed by management and third party actuary on regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate while we believe these estimate are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trend including the severity or frequency of claim medical cost inflation or fluctuation in premium differ from our estimate our result of operation could be impacted actual result related to these type of claim did not vary materially from estimated amount for fiscal or vendor allowancesvendor allowance primarily consist of volume rebate that are earned result of attaining certain purchase level and advertising co op allowance for the promotion of vendor product that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amount with additional amount earned for attaining certain purchase level these vendor allowance are accrued earned with those allowance received result of attaining certain purchase level accrued over the incentive period based on estimate of purchase we believe that our estimate of vendor allowance earned based on expected volume of purchase over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendor volume rebate and certain advertising co op allowance earned are initially recorded reduction in merchandise inventory and subsequent reduction in cost of sale when the related product is sold certain advertising co op allowance that are reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable cost incurred to promote vendor product are recorded an offset against advertising expense in sg impairment of long lived assetswe evaluate our long lived asset each quarter for indicator of potential impairment indicator of impairment include current period loss combined with history of loss management decision to relocate or close store or other location before the end of it previously estimated useful life or when change in other circumstance indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation for long lived asset is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flow which is generally the individual store level of contentsthe asset of store with indicator of impairment are evaluated by comparing it undiscounted cash flow with it carrying value the estimate of cash flow includes management assumption of cash inflow and outflow directly resulting from the use of those asset in operation including gross margin on net sale payroll and related item occupancy cost insurance allocation and other cost to operate store if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flow an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value impairment loss are recorded component of sg in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings when leased location close we also recognize in sg the net present value of future lease obligation le estimated sublease income we make critical assumption and estimate in completing impairment assessment of long lived asset our cash flow projection look several year into the future and include assumption on variable such future sale and operating margin growth rate economic condition market competition and inflation decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flow for the store with indicator of impairment would not have material impact on our result of operation our estimate of fair market value are generally based on market appraisal of owned location and estimate on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased location decrease in estimated sublease income and increase in the time required to sublease would not have material impact on our result of operation we recorded impairment and lease obligation cost on closing and relocation in the ordinary course of business well for the china store closing in fiscal which were not material to the consolidated financial statement in fiscal or goodwill and other intangible assetsgoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net asset acquired we do not amortize goodwill but do ass the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year or more often if indicator warrant by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit support it carrying value each year we may ass qualitative factor to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is le than it carrying amount basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessment with quantitative assessment completed at least every three year in fiscal we elected to estimate the fair value of our identified reporting unit using the present value of expected future discounted cash flow we make critical assumption and estimate in completing impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible asset our cash flow projection look several year into the future and include assumption on variable such future sale and operating margin growth rate economic condition market competition inflation and discount rate decrease in the estimated discounted cash flow for the reporting unit would not result in an impairment percentage point increase in the discount rate used would also not result in an impairment the reporting unit assessed for impairment during fiscal were canada and mexico during fiscal we determined that our goodwill balance for each of these reporting unit were not impaired we determined the fair value for each of these reporting unit wa substantially above it carrying value in fiscal we recorded charge of million to impair all of the goodwill associated with our former china reporting unit there were no impairment charge related to our remaining goodwill for fiscal or we amortize the cost of other intangible asset over their estimated useful life which range up to ten year unless such life are deemed indefinite intangible asset with indefinite life are tested in the
