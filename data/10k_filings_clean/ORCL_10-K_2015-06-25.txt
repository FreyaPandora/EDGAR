oracle partner network program extends our market reach by providing our partner with the resource they need to be successful in delivering solution to customer globally the majority of our hardware system product are sold through indirect channel including independent distributor and value added resellers seasonality and cyclicality our quarterly revenue have historically been affected by variety of seasonal factor including the structure of our sale force incentive compensation plan which are common in the technology industry our total revenue and operating margin are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter the operating margin of our business are generally affected by seasonal factor in similar manner our revenue in particular our new software license and cloud software subscription segment certain expense within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term see selected quarterly financial data in item of this annual report for more complete description of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenue expense and margin competition we face intense competition in all aspect of our business the nature of the it industry creates competitive landscape that is constantly evolving firm emerge expand or are acquired technology evolves and customer demand and competitive pressure otherwise change our customer are demanding le complexity and lower total cost in the implementation sourcing integration and ongoing maintenance of their enterprise software and hardware system our enterprise software and cloud and hardware offering compete directly with offering from some of the largest and most competitive company in the world including microsoft corporation microsoft international business machine corporation ibm intel hewlett packard company hp and sap ag and smaller company like table of content salesforce com inc and workday inc well many others in addition due to the low barrier to entry in many of our market segment new technology and new and growing competitor frequently emerge to challenge our offering our competitor range from company offering broad it solution across many of our line of business to vendor providing point solution or offering focused on specific functionality product area or industry in addition we expand into new market segment we will face increased competition we will compete with existing competitor well firm that may be partner in other area of our business and other firm with we have not previously competed like amazon com inc moreover we or our competitor may take certain strategic action including acquisition partnership and joint venture or repositioning of product line which invite even greater competition in one or more product category key competitive factor in each of the segment in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include total cost of ownership performance scalability reliability security functionality efficiency ease of management and quality of technical support our product and service sale and the relative strength of our product and service versus those of our competitor are also directly and indirectly affected by the following among other thing the adoption of cloud based it offering including software service platform service and infrastructure service offering total cost of ownership ease of deployment use and maintenance of our product and service offering compatibility between oracle product and service deployed within on premise it environment and public cloud it environment including our oracle cloud environment the adoption of commodity server and microprocessor the broader platform competition between our industry standard java technology platform and the net programming environment of microsoft operating system competition among our oracle solaris and linux operating system with alternative including microsoft window server and other unix and linux operating system the adoption of open source alternative to commercial software by enterprise software customer product feature and functionality developed internally by customer and their it staff product feature or functionality customized and implemented for customer by consultant system integrator or other third party and attractiveness of offering from business processing outsourcers for more information about the competitive risk we face refer to item risk factor included elsewhere in this annual report manufacturing to produce our hardware product we rely on both our internal manufacturing operation well third party manufacturing partner our internal manufacturing operation consist primarily of material procurement assembly testing and quality control of our oracle engineered system and certain of our enterprise and data center server storage system and networking product for all other manufacturing we generally rely on third party manufacturing partner to produce our hardware related component and hardware product and we may involve our internal manufacturing operation in the final assembly testing and quality control process for these component and product we distribute most of our hardware product either from our facility or partner facility our manufacturing process substantially are based on standardization of component across product type centralization of assembly and distribution center and build to order methodology in which product generally are built only after customer have placed firm order production of our hardware product requires that we purchase material supply product subassemblies and full assembly from number of vendor for most of our hardware product we have existing alternate source of supply or such source are readily available table of content however we do rely on sole source for certain of our hardware product result we continue to evaluate potential risk of disruption to our supply chain operation refer to risk factor included in item within this annual report for additional discussion of the challenge we encounter with respect to the source and availability of supply for our product and the related risk to our business research and development we develop the substantial majority of our product internally in addition we have extended our product offering and intellectual property through acquisition of business and technology we also purchase or license intellectual property right in certain circumstance internal development allows to maintain technical control over the design and development of our product we have number of united state and foreign patent and pending application that relate to various aspect of our product and technology while we believe that our patent have value no single patent is essential to or to any of our principal business segment research and development expenditure billion billion and billion in fiscal and respectively or of total revenue in

corporate controller and chief accounting officer from april to february previous experience includes year with arthur andersen llp most recently partner table of content item risk factor we operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environment that present numerous risk many of which are driven by factor that we can not control or predict the following discussion well our critical accounting policy and estimate discussion in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation item highlight some of these risk the risk described below are not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risk and uncertainty before investing in our security economic political and market condition can adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability which in turn could adversely affect our stock price our business is influenced by range of factor that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting these include general economic and business condition overall demand for enterprise software cloud offering hardware system and service governmental budgetary constraint or shift in government spending priority and general political development macroeconomic development like the continued slow pace of economic recovery in europe and part of the united state asia and south america could negatively affect our business operating result financial condition and outlook which in turn could adversely affect our stock price any general weakening of and related declining corporate confidence in the global economy or the curtailment of government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customer to reduce or eliminate their information technology it budget and spending which could cause customer to delay decrease or cancel purchase of our product and service or cause customer not to pay or to delay paying for previously purchased product and service in addition political unrest in place like ukraine syria and iraq and the related potential impact on global stability terrorist attack and the potential for other hostility in various part of the world potential public health crisis and natural disaster continue to contribute to climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability these factor generally have the strongest effect on our sale of new software license hardware system product hardware system support and related service and to lesser extent also may affect our renewal rate for software license update and product support and our subscription based cloud offering we may experience foreign currency gain and loss change in currency exchange rate can adversely affect customer demand and our revenue and profitability we conduct significant number of transaction and hold cash in currency other than the dollar change in the value of major foreign currency particularly the euro japanese yen and british pound relative to the dollar can significantly affect our total asset revenue operating result and cash flow which are reported in dollar in particular the economic uncertainty relating to european sovereign and other debt obligation may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate relative to the dollar fluctuation in foreign currency rate most notably the recent strengthening of the dollar against the euro adversely affect our revenue growth in term of the amount that we report in dollar after converting our euro based result into dollar and in term of actual demand for our product and service these product become relatively more expensive for euro based enterprise to purchase in addition currency variation can adversely affect margin on sale of our product in country outside of the united state generally our revenue and operating result are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currency and are positively affected when the dollar weakens in addition our reported asset generally are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currency significant portion of our consolidated cash and bank deposit among other asset are held in foreign currency the dollar strengthened relative to other currency including the euro in fiscal which is reflected in our result certain of our international subsidiary operate in economy that have been designated highly inflationary we have incurred foreign currency loss associated with the devaluation of currency in these highly inflationary economy relative to the dollar and we may continue to incur such loss in these country or other emerging market country where we do business table of content in addition we incur foreign currency transaction gain and loss primarily related to sublicense fee and other intercompany agreement among and our subsidiary that we expect to cash settle in the near term which are charged against earnings in the period incurred we have program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contract designed to offset the risk associated with certain foreign currency exposure we may suspend the program from time to time part of this program we enter into foreign currency forward contract so that increase or decrease in our foreign currency exposure are offset at least in part by gain or loss on the foreign currency forward contract in an effort to mitigate the risk and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gain or loss large portion of our consolidated operation are international and we expect that we will continue to realize gain or loss with respect to our foreign currency exposure net of gain or loss from our foreign currency forward contract for example we will experience foreign currency gain and loss in certain instance if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our foreign currency exposure if our hedging effort are ineffective or should we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuation will generally depend on the size and type of cross currency exposure that we enter into the currency exchange rate associated with these exposure and change in those rate whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contract to offset these exposure and other factor all of these factor could materially impact our result of operation financial position and cash flow we may fail to achieve our financial forecast due to inaccurate sale forecast or other factor our revenue particularly our new software license revenue and hardware system revenue are difficult to forecast result our quarterly operating result can fluctuate substantially we use pipeline system common industry practice to forecast sale and trend in our business our sale personnel monitor the status of all proposal and estimate when customer will make purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale these estimate are aggregated periodically to generate sale pipeline our pipeline estimate can prove to be unreliable both in particular quarter and over longer period of time in part the conversion rate or closure rate of the pipeline into contract can be difficult to estimate reduction in the conversion rate or in the pipeline could cause to plan or budget incorrectly and adversely affect our business or result of operation in particular slowdown in it spending or economic condition generally can unexpectedly reduce the conversion rate in particular period purchasing decision are delayed reduced in amount or cancelled the conversion rate can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customer to wait until the end of fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favorable term which can also impede our ability to negotiate execute and deliver upon these contract in timely manner in addition for newly acquired company we have limited ability to predict how their pipeline will convert into sale or revenue for number of quarter following the acquisition conversion rate post acquisition may be quite different from the acquired company historical conversion rate difference in conversion rate can also be affected by change in business practice that we implement in our newly acquired company these change may negatively affect customer behavior substantial portion of our new software license and hardware system contract is completed in the latter part of quarter and significant percentage of these are larger order because significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term sale and revenue shortfall tend to have disproportionately negative impact on our profitability the number of large new software license transaction and to lesser extent hardware system product transaction increase the risk of fluctuation in our quarterly result because delay in even small number of these transaction could cause our quarterly sale revenue and profitability to fall significantly short of our prediction our oracle cloud strategy including our oracle software service saas platform service paas infrastructure service iaa and data service daas offering may adversely affect our revenue and profitability we offer customer full range of consumption model including the deployment of our product via our cloud based saas paas iaa and daas offering these business model continue to evolve and we may not be able to compete effectively generate significant revenue or maintain the profitability of our cloud offering additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and saas delivery model offered by and our competitor may unfavorably impact the pricing of our on premise enterprise software offering and our cloud offering and ha dampening impact on overall demand for our on premise software product and service table of content offering which could reduce our revenue and profitability at least in the near term if we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing need of our customer our reputation cloud service provider could be harmed and our revenue and profitability could decline our cloud offering are generally purchased by customer on subscription basis and revenue from these offering are generally recognized ratably over the term of the subscription the deferred revenue that result from sale of our cloud offering may prevent any deterioration in sale activity associated with our cloud offering from becoming immediately observable in our consolidated statement of operation this is in contrast to revenue associated with our new software license arrangement whereby new software license revenue are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of the related software license we incur certain expense associated with the infrastructure and marketing of our cloud offering in advance of our ability to recognize the revenue associated with these offering customer demand for our cloud offering increase we experience volatility in our reported revenue and operating result due to the difference in timing of revenue recognition between our new software license arrangement and cloud offering arrangement we have also acquired number of cloud computing company and the integration of these company into our oracle cloud strategy may not be efficient or scalable anticipated which could adversely affect our ability to fully realize the benefit anticipated from these acquisition our success depends upon our ability to develop new product and service integrate acquired product and service and enhance our existing product and service rapid technological advance and evolving standard in computer hardware and software development and communication infrastructure changing and increasingly sophisticated customer need and frequent new product introduction and enhancement characterize the industry in which we compete if we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated product and service enhance and improve our product and support service in timely manner or position and price our product and service to meet demand customer may not purchase or subscribe to our software hardware or cloud offering or renew software support hardware support or cloud subscription contract renewal of these contract are important to the growth of our business in addition we can not provide any assurance that the standard on which we choose to develop new product will allow to compete effectively for business opportunity in emerging area we have continued to refresh and release new offering of our software and cloud and hardware product and service including our database multitenant database in memory saas paas iaa daas and oracle engineered system offering our business may be adversely affected if we do not continue to develop and release these or other new or enhanced product and service within the anticipated time frame is delay in market acceptance of new enhanced or acquired product line or service there are change in information technology trend that we do not adequately anticipate or address with our product development effort we do not timely optimize complementary product line and service or we fail to adequately integrate support or enhance acquired product line or service if our security measure for our software hardware service or oracle cloud offering are compromised and result our data our customer data or our it system are accessed improperly made unavailable or improperly modified our product and service may be perceived vulnerable our brand and reputation could be damaged the it service we provide to our customer could be disrupted and customer may stop using our product and service all of which could reduce our revenue and earnings increase our expense and expose to legal claim and regulatory action we are in the information technology business and our product and service including our oracle cloud offering store retrieve manipulate and manage our customer information and data external data well our own data we have reputation for secure and reliable product offering and related service and we have invested great deal of time and resource in protecting the integrity and security of our product service and the internal and external data that we manage table of content at time we encounter attempt by third party to identify and exploit product and service vulnerability penetrate or bypass our security measure and gain unauthorized access to our or our customer partner and supplier software hardware and cloud offering network and system any of which could lead to the compromise of personal information or the confidential information or data of oracle or our customer computer hacker and others may be able to develop and deploy it related virus worm and other malicious software program that could attack our product and service exploit potential security vulnerability of our product and service create system disruption and cause shutdown or denial of service this is also true for third party data product or service incorporated into our own data may also be accessed or modified improperly result of customer partner employee or supplier error or malfeasance and third party may attempt to fraudulently induce customer partner employee or supplier into disclosing sensitive information such user name password or other information in order to gain access to our data our customer supplier or partner data or the it system of oracle it customer supplier or partner high profile security breach at other company have increased in recent year and security industry expert and government official have warned about the risk of hacker and cyber attack targeting information technology product and business although this is an industry wide problem that affect other software and hardware company it affect oracle in particular because computer hacker tend to focus their effort on the most prominent it company and they may focus on oracle because of our reputation for and marketing effort associated with having secure product and service these risk will increase we continue to grow our cloud offering and store and process increasingly large amount of data including personal information and our customer confidential information and data and other external data and host or manage part of our customer business in cloud based it environment especially in customer sector involving particularly sensitive data such health science financial service and the government we also have an active acquisition program and have acquired number of company product service and technology over the year while we make significant effort to address any it security issue with respect to our acquired company we may still inherit such risk when we integrate these company within oracle if cyber attack or other security incident described were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of our customer or supplier data other external data or our own data or our it system or if the service we provide to our customer were disrupted or if our product or service are perceived having security vulnerability we could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation customer could lose confidence in the security and reliability of our product and service including our cloud offering and perceive them to be not secure this in turn could lead to fewer customer using our product and service and result in reduced revenue and earnings the cost we would incur to address and fix these security incident would increase our expense these type of security incident could also lead to lawsuit regulatory investigation and claim and increased legal liability including in some case contractual cost related to customer notification and fraud monitoring our business practice with respect to the collection use and management of personal information could give rise to liability or reputational harm result of governmental regulation legal requirement or industry standard relating to consumer privacy and data protection regulatory focus on privacy issue continues to increase and worldwide law and regulation concerning the handling of personal information expand and become more complex potential risk related to data collection and use within our business will intensify and foreign government have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulation or may in the near future interpret existing legislation or regulation in manner that could significantly impact the ability of oracle and our customer and data partner to collect augment analyze use transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain service oracle provides and data service this could be true particularly in those jurisdiction where privacy law or regulator take broader view of how personal information is defined therefore subjecting the handling of such data to heightened restriction that may be obstructive to the operation of oracle and it customer and data provider this impact may be acute in country that have passed or are considering passing legislation that requires data to remain localized in country this imposes financial cost on any service provider that is required to store data in jurisdiction not of it choosing and nonstandard operational process that are difficult and costly to integrate with global process regulator globally are also imposing greater monetary fine for privacy violation and the european table of content union eu is considering legislation that would impose fine for privacy violation based on percentage of global revenue change in law or regulation associated with the enhanced protection of certain type of sensitive data such healthcare data or other personal information could greatly increase our cost of providing our product and service or even prevent from offering certain of our service in jurisdiction that we operate additionally public perception and standard related to the privacy of personal information can shift rapidly in way that may affect oracle reputation or influence regulator to enact regulation and law that may limit oracle ability to provide certain product any failure or perceived failure by oracle to comply with federal state or foreign law and regulation including law and regulation regulating privacy data security or consumer protection or other policy public perception standard self regulatory requirement or legal obligation could result in lost or restricted business proceeding action or fine brought against or levied by governmental entity or others or could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation we might experience significant coding manufacturing or configuration error in our software hardware and cloud offering despite testing prior to their release and throughout the lifecycle of product or service software hardware and cloud offering sometimes contain coding or manufacturing error that can impact their function performance and security and result in other negative consequence the detection and correction of any error in released software hardware or cloud offering can be time consuming and costly error in our software hardware or cloud offering could affect their ability to properly function or operate with other software hardware or cloud offering could delay the development or release of new product or service or new version of product or service could result in creating security vulnerability in our product or service and could adversely affect market acceptance of our product or service this includes third party software product or service incorporated into our own if we experience error or delay in releasing our software hardware or cloud offering or new version thereof our sale could be affected and revenue could decline in addition we run oracle business operation well cloud and other service that we offer to our customer on our product and network therefore any flaw could affect our ability to conduct our business operation and the operation of our customer enterprise customer rely on our software and hardware product and service to run their business and error in our software hardware or cloud offering could expose to product liability performance and warranty claim well significant harm to our brand and reputation which could impact our future sale if we are unable to compete effectively the result of operation and prospect for our business could be harmed we face intense competition in all aspect of our business the nature of the it industry creates competitive landscape that is constantly evolving firm emerge expand or are acquired and technology evolves many vendor develop and market database middleware product application development tool business application collaboration product and business intelligence product among others that compete with our software and cloud offering these vendor include on premise software company and company that offer cloud based saas paas iaa and daas offering and business process outsourcing bpo competitive alternative to buying software and hardware our competitor that offer business application and middleware product may influence customer purchasing decision for the underlying database in an effort to persuade potential customer not to acquire our product we could lose customer if our competitor introduce new competitive product add new functionality acquire competitive product reduce price or form strategic alliance with other company we may also face increasing competition from open source software initiative in which competitor may provide software and intellectual property for free existing or new competitor could gain sale opportunity or customer at our expense our hardware system business competes with among others system manufacturer and resellers of system based on our own microprocessor and operating system and those of our competitor ii microprocessor chip manufacturer iii provider of storage product and iv certain industry specific hardware manufacturer including those serving communication hospitality and retail industry our hardware system business cause to compete with certain company that historically have been partner some of these competitor may have more experience than we do in managing hardware business large portion of our hardware product are based on our sparc microprocessor and oracle solaris operating system platform which ha smaller installed base than certain of our competitor platform and which may make it difficult for to win new customer that have already made significant investment in our competitor platform certain of these competitor also table of content compete very aggressively on price loss in our competitive position could result in lower revenue or profitability which could adversely impact our ability to realize the revenue and profitability forecast for our hardware system business our international sale and operation subject to additional risk that can adversely affect our operating result we derive substantial portion of our revenue from and have significant operation outside of the united state our international operation include software and hardware system development manufacturing assembly sale customer support consulting and other service and shared administrative service center compliance with international and law and regulation that apply to our international operation increase our cost of business in foreign jurisdiction these law and regulation include law and local law which include data privacy requirement labor relation law tax law anti competition regulation prohibition on payment to governmental official import and trade restriction and export requirement violation of these law and regulation could result in fine criminal sanction against our officer or our employee and prohibition on the conduct of our business any such violation could result in prohibition on our ability to offer our product and service in one or more country could delay or prevent potential acquisition and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion effort our ability to attract and retain employee our business and our operating result compliance with these law requires significant amount of management attention and effort which may divert management attention from running our business operation and could harm our ability to grow our business or may increase our expense we engage specialized or other additional resource to assist with our compliance effort our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risk and manage these difficulty we monitor our operation and investigate allegation of impropriety relating to transaction and the way in which such transaction are recorded where circumstance warrant we provide information and report our finding to government authority but no assurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authority we are also subject to variety of other risk and challenge in managing an organization operating in various country including those related to general economic condition in each country or region fluctuation in currency exchange rate and related impact to customer demand and our operating result difficulty in transferring fund from or converting currency in certain country such venezuela that have led to devaluation of our net asset in particular our cash asset in that country currency regulatory change including government austerity measure in certain country that we may not be able to sufficiently plan for or avoid that may unexpectedly impair bank deposit or other cash asset that we hold in these country or that impose additional tax that we may be required to pay in these country political unrest terrorism and the potential for other hostility including those in ukraine syria iraq and yemen natural disaster longer payment cycle and difficulty in collecting account receivable overlapping tax regime our ability to repatriate fund held by our foreign subsidiary to the united state at favorable tax rate public health risk particularly in area in which we have significant operation and reduced protection for intellectual property right in some country the variety of risk and challenge listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the supply chain operation for our hardware system product segment and the sale of our product and service in affected country or region the majority shareholder of oracle financial service software limited ofss publicly traded company in india and oracle corporation japan nokk publicly traded company in japan we are faced with several additional risk including being subject to local security regulation and being unable to exert full control that we would otherwise have if ofss or nokk were wholly owned subsidiary table of content acquisition present many risk and we may not realize the financial and strategic goal that were contemplated at the time of transaction in recent year we have invested billion of dollar to acquire number of company product service and technology selective and active acquisition program is an important element of our overall corporate strategy and we expect to continue to make acquisition in the future risk we may face in connection with our acquisition program include our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management attention may be diverted by acquisition transition or integration activity we may have difficulty managing an acquired company technology or line of business ii entering new market where we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitor may have stronger market position or iii retaining key personnel from the acquired company an acquisition may not further our business strategy we expected we may not integrate an acquired company or technology successfully we expected or we may overpay for or otherwise not realize the expected return on our investment which could adversely affect our business or operating result and potentially cause impairment to asset that we recorded part of an acquisition including intangible asset and goodwill our operating result or financial condition may be adversely impacted by claim or liability that we assume from an acquired company or technology or that are otherwise related to an acquisition including among others claim from government agency terminated employee current or former customer former stockholder or other third party pre existing contractual relationship of an acquired company that we would not have otherwise entered into the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment result of an acquired company practice and intellectual property claim or dispute we may fail to identify or ass the magnitude of certain liability shortcoming or other circumstance prior to acquiring company or technology which could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure unfavorable accounting treatment unexpected increase in tax due loss of anticipated tax benefit or other adverse effect on our business operating result or financial condition we may not realize the anticipated increase in our revenue from an acquisition for number of reason including if larger than predicted number of customer decline to renew software or hardware support contract or cloud based subscription contract if we are unable to sell the acquired product or service offering to our customer base or if contract model of an acquired company do not allow to recognize revenue on timely basis we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technology product service and their related supply chain operation with our existing line of business and supply chain infrastructure and maintaining uniform standard architecture control procedure and policy we may have multiple product line or service offering result of our acquisition that are offered priced and supported differently which could cause customer confusion and delay we may have higher than anticipated cost in continuing support and development of acquired product or service in general and administrative function that support new business model or in compliance with associated regulation that are more complicated than we anticipated we may be unable to obtain timely approval from or may otherwise have certain limitation restriction penalty or other sanction imposed on by worker council or similar body applicable employment law result of an acquisition which could adversely affect our integration plan in certain jurisdiction and potentially increase our integration and restructuring expense we may be unable to obtain required approval from governmental authority under competition and antitrust law on timely basis if at all which could among other thing delay or prevent from completing transaction otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goal of an acquisition or have other adverse effect on our current business and operation table of content our use of cash to pay for acquisition may limit other potential us of our cash including stock repurchase dividend payment and retirement of outstanding indebtedness we may significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirement if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition and we may have to delay or not proceed with substantial acquisition if we can not obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in timely manner or on favorable term to the extent that we issue significant amount of equity security in connection with future acquisition existing stockholder may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease and we may experience additional or unexpected change in how we are required to account for our acquisition pursuant to generally accepted accounting principle including arrangement that we assume from an acquisition the occurrence of any of these risk could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition or cash flow particularly in the case of larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisition our periodic workforce restructurings including reorganization of our sale force can be disruptive we have in the past restructured or made other adjustment to our workforce including our direct sale force on which we rely heavily in response to management change product change performance issue acquisition and other internal and external consideration in the past these type of sale force restructurings have resulted in increased restructuring cost increased sale and marketing cost and temporary reduced productivity while the sale team adjusted to their new role and responsibility in addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost saving benefit of these restructurings or do so within the expected timeframe these effect could recur in connection with future acquisition and other restructurings and our revenue and other result of operation could be negatively affected our hardware system revenue and profitability could decline if we do not manage the risk associated with our hardware system business our hardware system business may adversely affect our overall profitability if we do not effectively manage the associated risk we may not achieve our estimated revenue profit or other financial projection with respect to our hardware system business in timely manner or at all due to number of factor including we develop and introduce new version or next generation of our hardware system product customer may defer or delay purchase of existing hardware system product and wait for these new release all of which could adversely affect our hardware system revenue in the short term our hardware system business ha higher expense percentage of revenue and thus ha been le profitable than our software and cloud business we have focused on our more profitable oracle engineered system such our oracle exadata database machine oracle exalogic elastic cloud oracle exalytics in memory machine and oracle supercluster product which are in the relatively early stage of adoption by our customer and the de emphasis of our lower profit margin commodity hardware system product could adversely affect our hardware system revenue because the lower profit system have historically constituted larger portion of our hardware system revenue we face greater risk of potential write down and impairment of inventory higher warranty expense than in our software and cloud and service business and amortization and potential impairment of intangible asset associated with our hardware system business any of these item could result in material charge and adversely affect our operating result we may not be able to increase sale of hardware system support contract or such increase may take longer than we anticipate which could result in lower revenue and profitability or slower than expected growth of such revenue and profitability and we may acquire hardware company that are strategically important to but operate in hardware business with historically lower operating margin than our own ii have different legacy business table of content practice and go to market strategy that we may alter part of our integration effort which may significantly impact our estimated revenue and profit from the acquired company iii leverage different platform or competing technology that we may encounter difficulty in integrating or iv utilize unique manufacturing process that affect our ability to scale these acquired product within our own manufacturing operation our hardware system offering are complex product and if we can not successfully manage this complexity the result of our hardware system business will suffer designing developing manufacturing and introducing new hardware system product are complicated process the development process for our hardware system product is uncertain and requires high level of innovation after the development phase we must be able to forecast customer demand and manufacture new hardware system product in sufficient volume to meet this demand and do so in cost effective manner our build to order manufacturing model in which our hardware system product generally are not built until after customer place order may from time to time experience delay in delivering our hardware system product to customer in timely manner these delay could cause our customer to purchase hardware product and service from our competitor we must also manage new hardware product introduction and transition to minimize the impact of customer delayed purchase of existing hardware system product in anticipation of new hardware system product release it is also possible that we could experience design or manufacturing flaw which could delay or prevent the production of the component for which we have previously committed to pay or need to fulfill order from customer and could also prevent the production of our hardware product or cause our hardware product to be returned recalled or rejected resulting in lost revenue increase in warranty cost or cost related to remediation effort damage to our reputation penalty and litigation we depend on supplier to design develop manufacture and deliver on timely basis the necessary technology and component for our hardware product and there are some technology and component that can only be purchased from single vendor due to price quality technology availability or other business constraint result our supply chain operation could be disrupted or negatively impacted by natural disaster political unrest port stoppage or other transportation disruption or slowdown or other factor affecting the country or region where these single source component vendor are located or where the product are being shipped we may be unable to purchase these item from the respective single vendor on acceptable term or may experience significant delay or quality issue in the delivery of necessary technology part or component from particular vendor if we had to find new supplier for these technology part and component hardware system product shipment could be delayed which would adversely affect our hardware system revenue we could also experience fluctuation in component price which if unanticipated could negatively impact our hardware system business cost structure additionally we could experience change in shipping and logistics of our hardware product which could result in fluctuation in price and negatively impact our hardware system margin these factor may make it difficult for to plan and procure appropriate component inventory level in timely fashion to meet customer demand for our hardware product therefore we may experience component inventory shortage which may result in production delay or customer choosing to purchase fewer hardware product from or system product from our competitor we negotiate supply commitment with vendor early in the manufacturing process to ensure we have sufficient technology and component for our hardware product to meet anticipated customer demand we must also manage our level of older component inventory used in our hardware product to minimize inventory write offs or write down if we have excess inventory it may be necessary to write the inventory which would adversely affect our operating result if one or more of the risk described above occurs our hardware system business and related operating result could be materially and adversely affected we are susceptible to third party manufacturing and logistics delay which could result in the loss of sale and customer we outsource the design manufacturing assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware product to variety of company many of which are located outside the united state our reliance on these third party reduces our control over the design manufacturing and delivery process exposing to risk including reduced control over quality assurance product cost product supply and delivery delay well the political and economic uncertainty and natural disaster of the international location where certain of these third party manufacturer have facility and operation some country may raise national security concern or table of content impose market access restriction based on location of manufacture or sourcing any manufacturing disruption or logistics delay by these third party could impair our ability to fulfill order for these hardware system product for extended period of time if we are unable to manage our relationship with these third party effectively or if these third party experience delay disruption capacity constraint regulatory issue or quality control problem in their operation or fail to meet our future requirement for timely delivery our ability to ship and deliver certain of our hardware system product to our customer could be impaired and our hardware system business could be harmed we have simplified our supply chain process by reducing the number of third party manufacturing partner and the number of location where these third party manufacturer build our hardware system product we therefore have become more dependent on fewer number of these manufacturing partner and location if these partner experience production problem or delay or can not meet our demand for product we may not be able to find alternate manufacturing source in timely or cost effective manner if at all if we are required to change third party manufacturer our ability to meet our scheduled hardware system product delivery to our customer could be adversely affected which could cause the loss of sale and existing or potential customer delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware system product expense all of which could adversely affect the margin of our hardware business these challenge and risk also exist when we acquire company with hardware product and related supply chain operation in some case we may be dependent at least initially on these acquired company supply chain operation that we are le familiar with and thus we may be slower to adjust or react to these challenge and risk our software indirect sale channel could affect our future operating result our software indirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers system integrator implementers consultant education provider internet service provider network integrator and independent software vendor our relationship with these channel participant are important element of our software marketing and sale effort our financial result could be adversely affected if our contract with channel participant were terminated if our relationship with channel participant were to deteriorate if any of our competitor enter into strategic relationship with or acquire significant channel participant if the financial condition or operation of our channel participant were to weaken or if the level of demand for our channel participant product and service were to decrease there can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining expanding or developing our relationship with channel participant if we are not successful we may lose sale opportunity customer and revenue we may not be able to protect our intellectual property right we rely on copyright trademark patent and trade secret law confidentiality procedure control and contractual commitment to protect our intellectual property right despite our effort these protection may be limited unauthorized third party may try to copy or reverse engineer portion of our product or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property any patent owned by may be invalidated circumvented or challenged any of our pending or future patent application whether or not being currently challenged may not be issued with the scope of the claim we seek if at all in addition the law of some country do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property right do the law and court of the united state if we can not protect our intellectual property right against unauthorized copying or use or other misappropriation we may not remain competitive third party have claimed and in the future may claim infringement or misuse of intellectual property right and or breach of license agreement provision we periodically receive notice from or have lawsuit filed against by others claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property right and or breach of our agreement with them these third party include entity that do not have the capability to design manufacture or distribute product or service or that acquire intellectual property like patent for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claim of infringement and misuse we expect the number of such claim will increase we continue to acquire company and expand into new business the number of product and competitor in our industry segment grows the use and support of third party code including open source code becomes more prevalent in the industry table of content the volume of issued patent continues to increase and the proliferation of non practicing entity asserting intellectual property infringement claim increase responding to any such claim regardless of it validity could be time consuming costly and result in litigation divert management time and attention from developing our business require to pay monetary damage or enter into royalty and licensing agreement that we would not normally find acceptable require to stop selling or to redesign certain of our product require to release source code to third party possibly under open source license term require to satisfy indemnification obligation to our customer or otherwise adversely affect our business result of operation financial condition or cash flow we may lose key employee or may be unable to hire enough qualified employee we rely on the continued service of our senior management including our executive chairman of the board of director chief technology officer and founder our chief executive officer other member of our executive team and other key employee and the hiring of new qualified employee in the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business product development technical and other personnel in addition acquisition could cause to lose key personnel of the acquired company or at oracle we may also experience increased compensation cost that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sale we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel with rare exception we do not have long term employment or non competition agreement with our employee member of our senior management team have left oracle over the year for variety of reason and we can not assure you that there will not be additional departure which may be disruptive to our operation we continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in country where advanced technical expertise and other expertise are available at lower cost when we make adjustment to our workforce we may incur expense associated with workforce reduction that delay the benefit of more efficient workforce structure we may also experience increased competition for employee in these country the trend toward globalization continues which may affect our employee retention effort and increase our expense in an effort to offer competitive compensation program our general compensation program includes stock option and restricted stock unit rsus which are important tool in attracting and retaining employee in our industry if our stock price performs poorly it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employee in addition because we expense all stock based compensation we have changed and may in the future change our stock based and other compensation practice for example in fiscal we introduced rsu grant for certain of our employee and performance related stock unit grant for certain of our executive we continue to evaluate our compensation practice and other change we consider from time to time include reduction in the number of employee granted equity award reduction in the number of stock option or rsus granted per employee and alternative form of stock based compensation all of which may have an impact on our ability to retain employee and also impact the amount of stock based compensation expense that we record any change in our compensation practice or change made by competitor could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel our sale to government client subject to business volatility and risk including government budgeting cycle and appropriation early termination audit investigation sanction and penalty we derive revenue from contract with the government state and local government and foreign government and their respective agency which may terminate most of these contract at any time without cause there is increased pressure for government and their agency both domestically and internationally to reduce spending further our federal government contract are subject to the approval of appropriation made by the congress to fund the expenditure under these contract similarly our contract at the state and local level in the and our contract with foreign government and their agency are generally subject to government table of content funding authorization additionally government contract are generally subject to audit and investigation which could result in various civil and criminal penalty and administrative sanction including termination of contract refund of portion of fee received forfeiture of profit suspension of payment fine and suspension or debarment from future government business we may need to change our pricing model to compete successfully the intense competition we face in the sale of our product and service and general economic and business condition can put pressure on to change our price if our competitor offer deep discount on certain product or service or develop product that the marketplace considers more valuable we may need to lower price or offer other favorable term in order to compete successfully any such change may reduce margin and could adversely affect operating result additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and saas delivery model offered by and our competitor may unfavorably impact the pricing of our on premise enterprise software offering and our cloud offering well overall demand for our on premise software product and service offering which could reduce our revenue and profitability our software license update and product support fee and hardware system support fee are generally priced percentage of our net new software license fee and net new hardware system product fee respectively our competitor may offer lower pricing on their support offering which could put pressure on to further discount our product or support pricing any broad based change to our price and pricing policy could cause our revenue to decline or be delayed our sale force implement and our customer adjust to the new pricing policy some of our competitor may bundle product for promotional purpose or long term pricing strategy or provide guarantee of price and product implementation these practice could over time significantly constrain the price that we can charge for certain of our product if we do not adapt our pricing model to reflect change in customer use of our product or change in customer demand our revenue could decrease the increase in open source software distribution may also cause to change our pricing model we may not receive significant revenue from our current research and development effort for several year if at all developing software cloud and hardware offering is expensive and the investment in the development of these offering often involves long return on investment cycle an important element of our corporate strategy is to continue to make significant investment in research and development and related product and service opportunity both through internal investment and the acquisition of intellectual property from company that we have acquired accelerated product and service introduction and short software and hardware life cycle require high level of expenditure for research and development that could adversely affect our operating result if not offset by revenue increase we believe that we must continue to dedicate significant amount of resource to our research and development effort to maintain our competitive position however we do not expect to receive significant revenue from these investment for several year if at all business disruption could adversely affect our operating result significant portion of our critical business operation are concentrated in few geographic area we are highly automated business and disruption or failure of our system could cause delay in completing sale and providing service including some of our cloud offering major earthquake fire or other catastrophic event that result in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it system could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operation and result our future operating result could be materially and adversely affected adverse litigation result could affect our business we are subject to various legal proceeding litigation can be lengthy expensive and disruptive to our operation and can divert our management attention away from running our core business the result of our litigation also can not be predicted with certainty an adverse decision could result in monetary damage or injunctive relief that could affect our business operating result or financial condition additional information regarding certain of the lawsuit we are involved in is discussed under note of note to consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report we may have exposure to additional tax liability multinational corporation we are subject to income tax well non income based tax in both the united state and various foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax and other tax liability we are regularly under audit by tax authority and those authority often do not agree with position taken by on our tax return table of content change in tax law or tax ruling may have significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate for example the united state many country in the eu and other country where we do business are actively considering change in relevant tax accounting and other law regulation and interpretation including change to tax law applicable to corporate multinationals which if enacted could have significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate further in the ordinary course of global business there are many intercompany transaction and calculation where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our intercompany transfer pricing ha been and is currently being reviewed by the internal revenue service irs and by foreign tax jurisdiction and will likely be subject to additional audit in the future although we have negotiated certain unilateral advance pricing agreement with the irs and certain selected bilateral advance pricing agreement that cover some of our intercompany transfer pricing issue and preclude the relevant tax authority from making transfer pricing adjustment within the scope of these agreement these agreement do not cover substantial element of our transfer pricing in recent period transfer pricing audit in many foreign jurisdiction have become increasingly contentious similarly certain jurisdiction are increasingly raising concern about certain withholding tax matter in addition our provision for income tax could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdiction which we consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united state that have lower statutory tax rate and earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdiction that have higher statutory tax rate we are also subject to non income based tax such payroll sale use value added net worth property and good and service tax in both the united state and various foreign jurisdiction we are regularly under audit by tax authority with respect to these non income based tax and may have exposure to additional non income based tax liability our acquisition activity have increased our non income based tax exposure particularly with our entry into the hardware system business which increased the volume and complexity of law and regulation that we are subject to and with which we must comply although we believe that our income and non income based tax estimate are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audit or tax dispute will not be different from is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accrual charge to earnings resulting from acquisition may adversely affect our operating result under business combination accounting standard pursuant to asc business combination we recognize the identifiable asset acquired the liability assumed and any non controlling interest in acquired company generally at their acquisition date fair value and in each case separately from goodwill goodwill of the acquisition date is measured the excess amount of consideration transferred which is also generally measured at fair value and the net of the acquisition date amount of the identifiable asset acquired and the liability assumed our estimate of fair value are based upon assumption believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain after we complete an acquisition the following factor could result in material charge and adversely affect our operating result and may adversely affect our cash flow cost incurred to combine the operation of company we acquire such transitional employee expense and employee retention redeployment or relocation expense impairment of goodwill in particular within our consulting reporting unit or impairment of intangible asset both of which we have added to significantly in recent year and may continue to increase in the future amortization of intangible asset acquired reduction in the useful life of intangible asset acquired identification of or change to assumed contingent liability both income tax and non income tax related after our final determination of the amount for these contingency or the conclusion of the measurement period generally up to one year from the acquisition date whichever come first charge to our operating result to maintain certain duplicative pre merger activity for an extended period of time or to maintain these activity for period of time that is longer than we had anticipated charge to eliminate certain duplicative pre merger activity and charge to restructure our operation or to reduce our cost structure table of content charge to our operating result due to expense incurred to effect the acquisition and charge to our operating result due to the expensing of certain stock award assumed in an acquisition substantially all of these cost will be accounted for expense that will decrease our net income and earnings per share for the period in which those cost are incurred for example we recognized goodwill impairment loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal relating to our hardware system reporting unit charge to our operating result in any given period could differ substantially from other period based on the timing and size of our future acquisition and the extent of integration activity more detailed discussion of our accounting for business combination and other item is presented in the critical accounting policy and estimate section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation item there are risk associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness of may we had an aggregate of billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between calendar year and calendar year and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operation generate sufficient cash flow to service such debt and the other factor discussed in this section there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risk successfully we may also need to refinance portion of our outstanding debt it matures there is risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the term of any refinancing may not be favorable the term of our existing debt furthermore if prevailing interest rate or other factor at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rate upon refinancing the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase should we incur future increase in interest expense our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credit to reduce our federal income tax could be limited which could unfavorably affect our provision for income tax and effective tax rate in addition change by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity security and increase the interest amount we pay on outstanding or future debt these risk could adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation environmental and other related law and regulation subject to number of risk and could result in significant liability and cost some of our cloud and hardware system operation are subject to state federal and international law governing protection of the environment proper handling and disposal of material used for these product human health and safety the use of certain chemical substance and the labor practice of supplier we endeavor to comply with these environmental and other law yet compliance with these environmental and other law could increase our product design development procurement manufacturing delivery and administration cost limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non compliant inventory change our sale activity or otherwise impact future financial result of our cloud and hardware system business any violation of these law can subject to significant liability including fine penalty and possible prohibition of sale of our product and service into one or more state or country and result in material adverse effect on the financial condition or result of operation of our cloud and hardware system business the security and exchange commission ha adopted disclosure requirement for company that use certain conflict mineral commonly referred to tantalum tin tungsten and gold in their product our supply chain is multi tiered global and highly complex provider of hardware system end product we are several step removed from the mining and smelting or refining of any conflict mineral in our supply chain accordingly our ability to determine with certainty the origin and chain of custody of conflict mineral is limited our relationship with customer and supplier could suffer if we are unable to describe our product conflict free we may also face increased cost in complying with conflict mineral disclosure requirement significant portion of our hardware system revenue come from international sale environmental legislation such the eu directive on restriction of hazardous substance rohs the eu waste electrical and electronic equipment directive weee directive and china regulation on management method for controlling pollution caused by electronic information product may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware system revenue from the eu china and other country with similar environmental legislation we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirement the cumulative impact of international environmental legislation could be significant table of content our stock price could become more volatile and investment could lose value all of the factor discussed in this section could affect our stock price the timing of announcement in the public market regarding new product product enhancement or technological advance by our competitor or and any announcement by of acquisition major transaction or management change could also affect our stock price change in the amount and frequency of share repurchase or dividend could adversely affect our stock price our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community change in recommendation or earnings estimate by financial analyst change in investor or analyst valuation measure for our stock our credit rating and market trend unrelated to our performance significant drop in our stock price could also expose to the risk of security class action lawsuit which could result in substantial cost and divert management attention and resource which could adversely affect our business item unresolved

and jd edward application software product among others or renewing their saas paas and iaa contract with oracle customer are increasingly electing to run their it environment using our suite of oracle cloud offering customer deploy with the oracle cloud many are adopting hybrid it model whereby certain of their it resource are deployed and managed through the oracle cloud while other of their it resource are deployed and managed on premise and both set of resource can be managed one we focus the engineering of our product and service to best connect these different deployment model to enable flexibility ease agility compatibility extensibility and seamlessness selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy we believe our acquisition enhance the product and service that we can offer to customer expand our customer base provide greater scale to accelerate innovation grow our revenue and earnings and increase stockholder value table of content in recent year we have invested billion of dollar to acquire number of company product service and technology that add to are complementary to or have otherwise enhanced our existing offering we expect to continue to acquire company product service and technology to further our corporate strategy we have three business that deliver our application platform and infrastructure technology software and cloud hardware system and service these business can be further divided into certain operating segment note of note to consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report provides additional information related to our operating segment each of our business and operating segment ha unique characteristic and face different opportunity and challenge although we report our actual result in dollar we conduct significant number of transaction in currency other than dollar therefore we present constant currency information to provide framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuation an overview of our three business and related operating segment follows software and cloud business our software and cloud business which represented and of our total revenue in fiscal and respectively is comprised of three operating segment new software license and cloud software subscription cloud infrastructure service and software license update and product support on constant currency basis we expect that our software and cloud business total revenue generally will continue to increase due to continued demand for our software product and cloud software subscription offering our software license update and product support offering including the high percentage of customer that renew their software license update and product support contract and our acquisition which should allow to grow and continue to make investment in research and development new software license and cloud software subscription our new software license and cloud software subscription line of business market sell and delivers our application and platform technology including our saas and paas offering our saas and paas offering are collectively referred to cloud software subscription which provide customer choice of software application and platform that are delivered via cloud based it environment that we host manage and support and the licensing of our software product including oracle application oracle database oracle fusion middleware and java among others our application and platform technology are substantially built on standard based architecture that are designed to help customer reduce the cost and complexity of their it infrastructure our commitment to industry standard result in software that work in customer environment with oracle or non oracle hardware or software component and that can be adapted to meet specific industry or business need we focus the engineering of our product and service to best connect cloud and on premise deployment model to enable flexibility ease agility compatibility extensibility and seamlessness our software offering are substantially designed to operate on both single server and clustered server configuration for cloud or on premise it environment and to support choice of operating system including oracle solaris oracle linux microsoft window and third party unix product among others these approach are designed to support customer choice and reduce customer risk our customer include business of many size government agency educational institution and resellers we market and sell our software product and service to these customer with sale force positioned to offer the combination that best fit their need we enable customer to evolve and transform to substantially any it environment at whatever pace is most appropriate for them the growth in our new software license and our saas and paas revenue that we report is affected by the strength of general economic and business condition governmental budgetary constraint the competitive position of our software offering our acquisition and foreign currency fluctuation the substantial majority of our new software license transaction are characterized by long sale cycle and the timing of few large software license transaction can substantially affect our quarterly new software license revenue new software license and cloud software subscription revenue represented of our total revenue in fiscal and in each of fiscal and our cloud software subscription contract which consist of saas and paas arrangement are generally one to three year in duration and we strive to renew these contract when they are eligible for renewal our new software license and cloud software subscription segment margin ha historically trended upward over the course of the four quarter within particular fiscal year due to the historical table of content upward trend of our new software license revenue over those quarterly period and because the majority of our cost for this segment are predominantly fixed in the short term however our new software license and cloud software subscription segment margin ha been and will continue to be affected by the fair value adjustment relating to the cloud saas and paas obligation that we assumed in our business combination described further below and by the amortization of intangible asset associated with company and technology that we have acquired for certain of our acquired business we recorded adjustment to reduce the cloud saas and paas obligation to their estimated fair value at the acquisition date result required by business combination accounting rule we not recognize cloud saas and paas revenue related to acquired contract that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired business independent entity in the amount of million million and million in fiscal and respectively to the extent underlying cloud saas and paas contract are renewed with following an acquisition we will recognize the revenue for the full value of these contract over their respective contractual period cloud infrastructure service our cloud infrastructure service offering which represented of our total revenue in fiscal and in each of fiscal and provide comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance service for customer it infrastructure for fee for stated term that is hosted at our oracle data center facility select partner data center or physically on premise at customer facility deployment and management offering for our software and hardware and related it infrastructure including virtual machine instance that are subscription based and designed for computing and reliable and secure object storage and certain of our oracle engineered system and related support offering that are deployed in our customer data center for monthly fee software license update and product support customer that purchase software license update and product support are granted right to unspecified product upgrade and maintenance release and patch released during the term of the support period well technical support assistance our software license update and product support contract are generally one year in duration substantially all of our software license customer renew their software license update and product support contract annually the growth of software license update and product support revenue is primarily influenced by three factor the percentage of our software support contract customer base that renews it software support contract the amount of new software support contract sold in connection with the sale of new software license and the amount of software support contract assumed from company we have acquired software license update and product support revenue which represented and of our total revenue in fiscal and respectively is our highest margin business unit our software support margin during fiscal were and accounted for of our total margin over the same period our software license update and product support margin have been affected by fair value adjustment relating to software support obligation assumed in business combination described further below and by amortization of intangible asset however over the longer term we believe that software license update and product support revenue and margin will grow for the following reason substantially all of our customer including customer from acquired company renew their software support contract when eligible for renewal substantially all of our customer purchase software license update and product support contract when they buy new software license resulting in further increase in our software support contract base even if new software license revenue growth wa flat software license update and product support revenue would continue to grow in comparison to the corresponding prior year period assuming contract renewal and cancellation rate and foreign currency rate remained relatively constant since substantially all new software license transaction result in the sale of software license update and product support contract which add to our software support contract base and our acquisition have increased our software support contract base well the portfolio of product available to be licensed and supported we recorded adjustment to reduce software support obligation assumed in business combination to their estimated fair value at the acquisition date result required by business combination accounting rule table of content we did not recognize software license update and product support revenue related to software support contract that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired business independent entity in the amount of million million and million in fiscal and respectively to the extent underlying software support contract are renewed with following an acquisition we will recognize the revenue for the full value of the software support contract over the respective support period the majority of which are one year hardware system business our hardware system business is comprised of two operating segment hardware system product and hardware system support our hardware business represented of our total revenue in fiscal and we expect our hardware business to have lower operating margin percentage of revenue than our software and cloud business due to the incremental cost we incur to produce and distribute these product and to provide support service including direct material and labor cost we expect to make investment in research and development to improve existing hardware product and service and to develop new hardware product and service hardware system product we provide broad selection of hardware system and related service including oracle engineered

industry among others our hardware product and service for communication network include network signaling policy control and subscriber data management solution and session border control technology among others the majority of our hardware system product are sold through indirect channel including independent distributor and value added resellers to produce our hardware product we rely on both our internal manufacturing operation well third party manufacturing partner our internal manufacturing operation consist primarily of material procurement assembly testing and quality control of our oracle engineered system and certain of our enterprise and data center server and storage system for all other manufacturing we generally rely on third party manufacturing partner to produce our hardware related component and hardware product and we may involve our internal manufacturing operation in the final assembly testing and quality control process for these component and product we distribute most of our hardware product either from our facility or partner facility we strive to reduce cost by simplifying our manufacturing process through increased standardization of component across product type and build to order manufacturing process in which product generally are built only after customer have placed firm order our hardware system product revenue cost of hardware system product and hardware system operating margin that we report are affected by our strategy for and the competitive position of our hardware system product the strength of general economic and business condition governmental budgetary constraint certain of our acquisition and foreign currency rate fluctuation in addition our operating margin for our hardware system product segment have been and will be affected by the amortization of intangible asset our quarterly hardware system product revenue are difficult to predict the timing of customer order and delay in our ability to timely manufacture or deliver few large hardware transaction among other factor could substantially affect the amount of hardware system product revenue expense and operating margin that we report hardware system support our hardware system support offering provide customer with software update for software component that are essential to the functionality of our hardware product such oracle solaris and certain other software product and can include product repair maintenance service and technical support service typically our hardware system support contract arrangement are priced percentage of the net hardware system product fee are invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the support period and are one year in duration we continue to evolve hardware system support process that are intended to proactively identify and solve quality issue and to increase the amount of new and renewed hardware system support contract sold in connection with the sale of our hardware system product our hardware system support revenue that we report are influenced by number of factor including the volume of purchase of hardware product the mix of hardware product purchased whether customer decide to purchase hardware system support contract at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale the percentage of our hardware system support contract customer base that renews it support contract and our acquisition substantially all of these factor are heavily influenced by our customer decision to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware system infrastructure to newly developed technology that are available our hardware system support margin have been and will be affected by certain of our acquisition and related accounting including fair value adjustment relating to hardware system support obligation assumed and by the amortization of intangible asset required by business combination accounting rule we recorded adjustment to reduce our hardware system support revenue for contract assumed from our acquisition to their estimated fair value these amount would have been recorded hardware system support revenue by table of content the acquired business independent entity in the amount of million million and million for fiscal and respectively to the extent underlying hardware system support contract are renewed with following an acquisition we will recognize the revenue for the full value of the hardware system support contract over the respective support period service business our service business which represented and of our total revenue in fiscal fiscal and fiscal respectively is comprised of the remainder of our operating segment our service business ha lower margin than our software and cloud and hardware business our service revenue are impacted by our strategy for and the competitive position of our service certain of our acquisition general economic condition governmental budgetary constraint personnel reduction in our customer it department tighter control over discretionary spending and the growth in our software and hardware system product revenue our service business offering include consulting service that are designed to help our customer and global system integrator partner more successfully architect and deploy our product including it strategy alignment enterprise architecture planning and design initial product

offered to customer partner and employee through variety of format including instructor led class at our education center live virtual training self paced online training private event and custom training acquisition selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy in recent year we have invested billion of dollar to acquire number of complementary company product service and technology including micros system inc micros in fiscal responsys inc responsys and tekelec global inc tekelec in fiscal and acme packet inc acme packet in fiscal among others we believe our acquisition program strengthens our competitive position enhances the product and service that we can offer to customer expands our customer base provides greater scale to accelerate innovation grows our revenue and earnings and increase stockholder value we expect to continue to acquire company product service and technology in furtherance of our corporate strategy note of note to consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report provides additional information related to our recent acquisition we believe we can fund our future acquisition with our internally available cash cash equivalent and marketable security cash generated from operation additional borrowing or from the issuance of additional security we estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings operating margin cash flow and return on invested capital target before deciding to move forward with an acquisition critical accounting policy and estimate our consolidated financial statement are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle gaap set forth in the financial accounting standard board fasb accounting standard codification asc and we consider the various staff accounting bulletin and other applicable guidance issued by the united state security and exchange commission sec gaap set forth within the asc requires to make certain estimate judgment and assumption we believe that the estimate judgment and assumption upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to at the time that these table of content estimate judgment and assumption are made these estimate judgment and assumption can affect the reported amount of asset and liability of the date of the financial statement well the reported amount of revenue and expense during the period presented to the extent there are difference between these estimate judgment or assumption and actual result our financial statement will be affected the accounting policy that reflect our more significant estimate judgment and assumption and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial result include the following revenue recognition business combination goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessment accounting for income tax legal and other contingency stock based compensation in many case the accounting treatment of particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and doe not require management judgment in it application there are also area in which management judgment in selecting among available alternative would not produce materially different result our senior management ha reviewed our critical accounting policy and related disclosure with the finance and audit committee of the board of director revenue recognition our source of revenue include software and cloud revenue including new software license revenue earned from granting license to use our software product and industry specific software cloud saas and paas revenue generated from fee for granting customer access to broad range of our software and related support offering on subscription basis in secure standard based cloud computing environment cloud iaa revenue generated from fee for deployment and management offering for our software and hardware and related it infrastructure generally on subscription basis and software license update and product support revenue described further below hardware system revenue which include the sale of hardware system product including oracle engineered system computer server storage product networking and data center fabric product and industry specific hardware and hardware system support revenue and service which include software and hardware related service including consulting advanced customer support and education revenue revenue generally are recognized net of any tax collected from customer and subsequently remitted to governmental authority revenue recognition for software product and software related service software element new software license revenue primarily represent fee earned from granting customer license to use our database middleware and application software and exclude cloud saas and paas revenue and revenue derived from software license update which are included in software license update and product support revenue the basis for our new software license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in asc software revenue recognition we exercise judgment and use estimate in connection with the determination of the amount of software and software related service revenue to be recognized in each accounting period for software license arrangement that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software we recognize new software license revenue when we enter into legally binding arrangement with customer for the license of software we deliver the product the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingency or significant uncertainty and collection is probable revenue that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing condition are not met are recognized when those condition are subsequently met substantially all of our software license arrangement do not include acceptance provision however if acceptance provision exist part of public policy for example in agreement with government entity where table of content acceptance period are required by law or within previously executed term and condition that are referenced in the current agreement and are short term in nature we generally recognize revenue upon delivery provided the acceptance term are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criterion have been met if acceptance provision are not perfunctory for example acceptance provision that are long term in nature or are not included standard term of an arrangement revenue are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period the vast majority of our software license arrangement include software license update and product support contract which are entered into at the customer option and are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement typically one year software license update provide customer with right to unspecified software product upgrade maintenance release and patch released during the term of the support period product support includes internet access to technical content well internet and telephone access to technical support personnel software license update and product support contract are generally priced percentage of the net new software license fee substantially all of our customer renew their software license update and product support contract annually revenue recognition for multiple element arrangement software product and software related service software arrangement we often enter into arrangement with customer that purchase both software related product and software related service from at the same time or within close proximity of one another referred to software related multiple element arrangement such software related multiple element arrangement include the sale of our software product software license update and product support contract and other software related service whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other element for those software related multiple element arrangement we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of new software license revenue to be recognized pursuant to asc under the residual method if fair value exists for undelivered element in multiple element arrangement such fair value of the undelivered element is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the software license we allocate the fair value of each element of software related multiple element arrangement based upon it fair value determined by our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe described further below with any remaining amount allocated to the software license revenue recognition for cloud saas paas and iaa offering hardware system product hardware system support and related service nonsoftware element our revenue recognition policy for nonsoftware deliverable including cloud saas paas and iaa offering hardware system product support and related service is based upon the accounting guidance contained in asc revenue recognition multiple element arrangement and we exercise judgment and use estimate in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud saas paas and iaa revenue hardware system product revenue support and related service revenue to be recognized in each accounting period revenue from the sale of our nonsoftware element are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we deliver the product and passage of the title to the buyer occurs the sale price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured revenue that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing condition are not met are recognized when those condition are subsequently met when applicable we reduce revenue for estimated return or certain other incentive program where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effect of these item where an arrangement is subject to acceptance criterion and the acceptance provision are not perfunctory for example acceptance provision that are long term in nature or are not included standard term of an arrangement revenue are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period our cloud saas and paas offering generally provide customer access to certain of our software within cloud based it environment that we manage host and support and offer to customer on subscription basis revenue for our cloud saas and paas offering are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customer and all other revenue recognition criterion have been satisfied table of content our cloud iaa offering provide deployment and management offering for our software and hardware and related it infrastructure including comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance service arrangement for customer it infrastructure for stated term that is hosted at our data center facility select partner data center or physically on premise at customer facility generally for term based fee and virtual machine instance that are subscription based and designed for computing and reliable and secure object storage revenue for these cloud iaa offering are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customer and all other revenue recognition criterion have been satisfied revenue from the sale of hardware system product represent amount earned primarily from the sale of our oracle engineered system computer server storage networking and industry specific hardware our hardware system support offering generally provide customer with software update for the software component that are essential to the functionality of our hardware product and can also include product repair maintenance service and technical support service hardware system support contract are generally priced percentage of the net hardware system product fee hardware system support contract are entered into at the customer option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement which are typically one year revenue recognition for multiple element arrangement cloud saas paas and iaa offering hardware system product hardware system support and related service nonsoftware arrangement we enter into arrangement with customer that purchase both nonsoftware related product and service from at the same time or within close proximity of one another referred to nonsoftware multiple element arrangement each element within nonsoftware multiple element arrangement is accounted for separate unit of accounting provided the following criterion are met the delivered product or service have value to the customer on standalone basis and for an arrangement that includes general right of return relative to the delivered product or service delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by we consider deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by or another vendor or could be resold by the customer further our revenue arrangement generally do not include general right of return relative to the delivered product where the aforementioned criterion for separate unit of accounting are not met the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element and treated single unit of accounting for the purpose of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition for those unit of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated single unit of accounting we generally recognize revenue over the contractual period of the arrangement or in the case of our cloud offering we generally recognize revenue over the contractual term of the cloud software subscription for the purpose of revenue classification of the element that are accounted for single unit of accounting we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line item within our consolidated statement of operation based on rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling price of such element for our nonsoftware multiple element arrangement we allocate revenue to each element based on selling price hierarchy at the arrangement inception the selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy vsoe if available third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available description to how we determine vsoe tpe and esp is provided below if tangible hardware system product includes software we determine whether the tangible hardware system product and the software work together to deliver the product essential functionality and if so the entire product is treated nonsoftware deliverable the total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverable using the relative selling price of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy we limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered element to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional product or service or meeting of any specified performance condition when possible we establish vsoe of selling price for deliverable in software and nonsoftware multiple element arrangement using the price charged for deliverable when sold separately and for software license update and product support and hardware system support based on the renewal rate offered to customer tpe table of content is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor product or service in standalone arrangement with similarly situated customer if we are unable to determine the selling price because vsoe or tpe doe not exist we determine esp for the purpose of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transaction including transaction whereby the deliverable wa sold on standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factor including but not limited to pricing practice including discounting margin objective competition contractually stated price the geography in which we offer our product and service the type of customer distributor value added reseller government agency and direct end user among others and the stage of the product lifecycle the determination of esp is made through consultation with and approval by our management taking into consideration our pricing model and go to market strategy our or our competitor pricing and go to market strategy evolve we may modify our pricing practice in the future which could result in change to our determination of vsoe tpe and esp result our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangement could differ materially from our result in the current period selling price are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant change in our selling price revenue recognition policy applicable to both software and nonsoftware element revenue recognition for multiple element arrangement arrangement with software and nonsoftware element we also enter into multiple element arrangement that may include combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related product and service offering including new software license software license update and product support cloud saas paas and iaa offering hardware system product hardware system support consulting advanced customer support service and education in such arrangement we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the software group of element whole and to the nonsoftware element we then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective element within that group following the guidance in asc and our policy described above after the arrangement consideration ha been allocated to the element we account for each respective element in the arrangement described above other revenue recognition policy applicable to software and nonsoftware element many of our software arrangement include consulting implementation service sold separately under consulting engagement contract and are included part of our service business consulting revenue from these arrangement are generally accounted for separately from new software license revenue because the arrangement qualify service transaction defined in asc the more significant factor considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of service consideration of whether the service are essential to the functionality of the licensed product degree of risk availability of service from other vendor timing of payment and impact of milestone or acceptance criterion on the realizability of the software license fee revenue for consulting service are generally recognized the service are performed if there is significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting service revenue are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved we estimate the proportional performance on contract with fixed or not to exceed fee on monthly basis utilizing hour incurred to date percentage of total estimated hour to complete the project if we do not have sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenue are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that the service have been completed when total cost estimate exceed revenue we accrue for the estimated loss immediately using cost estimate that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the service the complexity of the estimation process and factor relating to the assumption risk and uncertainty inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affect the amount of revenue and related expense reported in our consolidated financial statement number of internal and external factor can affect our estimate including labor rate utilization and efficiency variance and specification and testing requirement change our advanced customer support service are offered standalone arrangement or part of arrangement to customer buying other software and non software product and service we offer these advanced support table of content service both on premise and remote to oracle customer to enable increased performance and higher availability of their product and service depending upon the nature of the arrangement revenue from these service are recognized the service are performed or ratably over the term of the service period which is generally one year or le education revenue are also part of our service business and include instructor led medium based and internet based training in the use of our software and hardware product education revenue are recognized the class or other education offering are delivered if an arrangement contains multiple element and doe not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transaction then new software license revenue and or hardware system product revenue including the cost of hardware system product are generally recognized together with the service based on contract accounting using either the percentage of completion or completed contract method contract accounting is applied to any bundled software and cloud hardware system and service arrangement that include milestone or customer specific acceptance criterion that may affect collection of the software license or hardware system product fee where consulting service include significant modification or customization of the software or hardware system product or are of specialized nature and generally performed only by oracle where significant consulting service are provided for in the software license contract or hardware system product contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted or where the software license or hardware system product payment is tied to the performance of consulting service for the purpose of revenue classification of the element that are accounted for single unit of accounting we allocate revenue to software and nonsoftware element based on rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of the relative selling price of such element we also evaluate arrangement with governmental entity containing fiscal funding or termination for convenience provision when such provision are required by law to determine the probability of possible cancellation we consider multiple factor including the history with the customer in similar transaction the essential use of the software or hardware system product and the planning budgeting and approval process undertaken by the governmental entity if we determine upon execution of these arrangement that the likelihood of cancellation is remote we then recognize revenue all of the criterion described above have been met if such determination can not be made revenue are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity we ass whether fee are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenue if all other revenue recognition requirement are met our standard payment term are net day however payment term may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed payment that are due within six month are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangement and thereby satisfy the required criterion for revenue recognition while most of our arrangement for sale within our business include short term payment term we have standard practice of providing long term financing to creditworthy customer primarily through our financing division since fiscal when our financing division wa formed we have established history of collection without concession on these receivables with payment term that generally extend up to five year from the contract date provided all other revenue recognition criterion have been met we recognize new software license revenue and hardware system product revenue for these arrangement upon delivery net of any payment discount from financing transaction we have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on non recourse basis to third party financing institution within day of the contract date of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sale cash flow from operating activity in our consolidated statement of cash flow we account for the sale of these receivables true sale defined in asc transfer and servicing we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables in addition we enter into arrangement with leasing company for the sale of our hardware system product these leasing company in turn lease our product to end user the leasing company generally have no recourse to in the event of default by the end user and we recognize revenue upon delivery if all other revenue recognition criterion have been met table of content our customer include several of our supplier and occasionally we have purchased good or service for our operation from these vendor at or about the same time that we have sold our product to these same company concurrent transaction software license agreement or sale of hardware system that occur within three month time period from the date we have purchased good or service from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure when we acquire good or service from customer we negotiate the purchase separately from any sale transaction at term we consider to be at arm length and settle the purchase in cash we recognize revenue from concurrent transaction if all of our revenue recognition criterion are met and the good and service acquired are necessary for our current operation business combination we apply the provision of asc business combination in the accounting for our acquisition it requires to recognize separately from goodwill the asset acquired and the liability assumed at the acquisition date fair value goodwill of the acquisition date is measured the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair value of the asset acquired and the liability assumed while we use our best estimate and assumption to accurately value asset acquired and liability assumed at the acquisition date well contingent consideration where applicable our estimate are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustment to the asset acquired and liability assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the value of asset acquired or liability assumed whichever come first any subsequent adjustment are recorded to our consolidated statement of operation accounting for business combination requires our management to make significant estimate and assumption especially at the acquisition date including our estimate for intangible asset contractual obligation assumed restructuring liability pre acquisition contingency and contingent consideration where applicable although we believe the assumption and estimate we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain example of critical estimate in valuing certain of the intangible asset we have acquired include but are not limited to future expected cash flow from software license sale cloud saas paas and iaa contract

into commercially viable product and estimated cash flow from the project when completed the acquired company brand and competitive position well assumption about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company product portfolio and discount rate unanticipated event and circumstance may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumption estimate or actual result we estimate the fair value of our cloud saas and paas collectively cloud software subscription software license update and product support and hardware system support obligation assumed the estimated fair value of these performance obligation are determined utilizing cost build up approach the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the cost related to fulfilling the obligation plus normal profit margin the estimated cost to fulfill the obligation are based on the historical direct cost related to providing the service including the correction of any error in the product acquired the sum of these cost and operating profit approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay third party to assume the performance obligation we do not include any cost associated with selling effort or research and development or the related fulfillment margin on these cost profit associated with any selling effort is excluded because the table of content acquired entity would have concluded those selling effort on the performance obligation prior to the acquisition date we also do not include the estimated research and development cost in our fair value determination these cost are not deemed to represent legal obligation at the time of acquisition result we did not recognize cloud saas and paas revenue related to cloud saas and paas contract in the amount of million million and million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired business independent entity in fiscal and respectively we did not recognize software license update and product support revenue related to support contract in the amount of million million and million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired business independent entity in fiscal and respectively in addition we did not recognize hardware system support revenue related to hardware system support contract that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired business independent entity in the amount of million million and million for fiscal and respectively historically substantially all of our customer including customer from acquired company renew their software license update and product support contract when the contract are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud saas and paas and hardware system support contract to the extent cloud saas and paas software support or hardware system support contract are renewed we will recognize the revenue for the full value of the contract over their respective contractual period which are generally one year in duration in connection with business combination or other strategic initiative we may estimate cost associated with restructuring plan committed to by our management restructuring cost are typically comprised of employee severance cost cost of consolidating duplicate facility and contract termination cost restructuring expense are based upon plan that have been committed to by our management but may be refined in subsequent period we account for cost to exit or restructure certain activity of an acquired company separately from the business combination pursuant to asc exit or disposal cost obligation liability for cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at it fair value in our consolidated statement of operation in the period in which the liability is incurred when estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activity assumption are applied regarding estimated sub lease payment to be received which can differ materially from actual result this may require to revise our initial estimate which may materially affect our result of operation and financial position in the period the revision is made for given acquisition we may identify certain pre acquisition contingency of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre acquisition contingency throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to ass whether we include these contingency part of the fair value estimate of asset acquired and liability assumed and if so to determine their estimated amount if we can not reasonably determine the fair value of pre acquisition contingency non income tax related by the end of the measurement period which is generally the case given the nature of such matter we will recognize an asset or liability for such pre acquisition contingency if it is probable that an asset existed or liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and ii the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated subsequent to the measurement period change in our estimate of such contingency will affect earnings and could have material effect on our result of operation and financial position in addition uncertain tax position and tax related valuation allowance assumed in connection with business combination are initially estimated of the acquisition date we reevaluate these item quarterly based upon fact and circumstance that existed of the acquisition date with any adjustment to our preliminary estimate being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance or contingency estimated value whichever come first change to these uncertain tax position and tax related valuation allowance will affect our provision for income tax in our consolidated statement of operation and could have material impact on our result of operation and financial position goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessment we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever event or change in circumstance indicate it carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with asc intangible goodwill and other according to asc we can opt to perform qualitative assessment to test reporting unit goodwill for table of content impairment or we can directly perform the two step impairment test based on our qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of reporting unit is more likely than not likelihood of more than percent to be le than it carrying amount the two step impairment test prescribed by asc will be performed in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to it carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net asset assigned to that unit goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net asset assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill if the carrying value of reporting unit goodwill exceeds it implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference determining the fair value of reporting unit involves the use of significant estimate and assumption these estimate and assumption include revenue growth rate and operating margin used to calculate projected future cash flow risk adjusted discount rate future economic and market condition and determination of appropriate market comparables we base our fair value estimate on assumption we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain actual future result may differ from those estimate in addition we make certain judgment and assumption in allocating shared asset and liability to determine the carrying value for each of our reporting unit based upon our most recent annual goodwill impairment review which took place of march we recorded goodwill impairment loss related to our hardware system product reporting unit we considered several approach to determine the fair value of our hardware system reporting unit and concluded the most appropriate to be the income approach based upon the completion of our annual forecasting process the fair value of our hardware system product reporting unit under the income approach wa impacted by lower forecasted operating result primarily caused by lower forecasted revenue and our continued investment in research and development activity we compared the implied fair value of goodwill in our hardware system product reporting unit to it carrying value which resulted in million goodwill impairment loss representing the aggregate amount of goodwill in our hardware system product reporting unit the aggregate hardware system reporting unit goodwill that wa impaired in fiscal resulted from our acquisition of pillar data system inc xsigo system inc greenbytes inc and micros system inc such impairment loss wa recorded to acquisition related and other expense in our fiscal consolidated statement of operation we did not recognize any goodwill impairment loss in fiscal or our most recent annual goodwill impairment review for our other reporting unit which also took place on march did not result in goodwill impairment loss other than our consulting reporting unit all of our other reporting unit had fair value that substantially exceeded their carrying value our consulting reporting unit had billion of goodwill on march and experienced revenue and operating margin decline in fiscal of our most recent annual goodwill impairment review our consulting reporting unit fair value wa in excess of it carrying value we estimate that should our consulting reporting unit projected margin and related cash flow unfavorably deviate from our projection by or more our consulting reporting unit likely would incur goodwill impairment loss we make judgment about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible asset whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that an impairment may exist each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of purchased intangible asset and whether event or change in circumstance warrant revision to the remaining period of amortization recoverability of finite lived intangible asset is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flow the asset is expected to generate we review indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment annually and whenever event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of indefinite lived intangible asset is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to it fair value if the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset assumption and estimate about future value and remaining useful life of our intangible and other long lived asset are complex and subjective they can be affected by variety of factor including external factor such industry and economic trend and internal factor such change in our business strategy and our internal table of content forecast although we believe the historical assumption and estimate we have made are reasonable and appropriate different assumption and estimate could materially impact our reported financial result we did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charge in fiscal or accounting for income tax significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision in the ordinary course of global business there are many transaction and calculation where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainty arise consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangement among related entity the process of identifying item of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expense to avoid double taxation although we believe that our estimate are reasonable the final tax outcome of these matter could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accrual such difference could have material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no tax have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united state remittance of foreign earnings to the united state are planned based on projected cash flow working capital and investment need of our foreign and domestic operation based on these assumption we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the united state and provide federal tax on these amount material change in our estimate to how much of our foreign earnings will be distributed to the united state or tax legislation that limit or restricts the amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the united state could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate we record valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in order for to realize our deferred tax asset we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdiction where the deferred tax asset are located we consider future growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdiction in which we operate historical earnings taxable income in prior year if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategy in determining the need for valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset would be realized we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance an adjustment to earnings at such time we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimate and assumption that could differ from the actual result reflected in income tax return filed during the subsequent year adjustment based on filed return are generally recorded in the period when the tax return are filed and the global tax implication are known which can materially impact our effective tax rate the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audit by federal state and foreign tax authority which often result in proposed assessment our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental description of our accounting policy associated with tax related contingency assumed part of business combination is provided under business combination above for those tax related contingency that are not part of business combination we account for these uncertain tax issue pursuant to asc income tax which contains two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit including resolution of any related appeal or litigation process the second step is to measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax position no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matter we adjust reserve for our uncertain tax position due to changing fact and circumstance such the closing of tax audit judicial ruling and refinement of estimate or realization of earnings or deduction that differ from table of content our estimate to the extent that the final outcome of these matter is different than the amount recorded such difference generally will impact our provision for income tax in the period in which such determination is made our provision for income tax include the impact of reserve provision and change to reserve that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalty in addition part of our accounting for business combination intangible asset are recognized at fair value and goodwill is measured the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair value of asset acquired impairment charge associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded amortization expense associated with acquired intangible asset are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure however deferred tax have been recorded for non deductible amortization expense part of the accounting for business combination we have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangible among different taxing jurisdiction including those with nominal or zero percent tax rate in establishing the related deferred tax liability legal and other contingency we are currently involved in various claim and legal proceeding quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and ass our potential financial exposure description of our accounting policy associated with contingency assumed part of business combination is provided under business combination above for legal and other contingency that are not part of business combination we accrue liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable because of uncertainty related to these matter accrual are based only on the best information available at the time the accrual are made additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claim and litigation and may revise our estimate such revision in the estimate of the potential liability could have material impact on our result of operation and financial position stock based compensation we account for share based payment to employee including grant of service based employee stock option service based restricted stock award performance based restricted stock award psus and purchase under employee stock purchase plan in accordance with asc compensation stock compensation which requires that share based payment to the extent they are compensatory be recognized in our consolidated statement of operation based on their fair value and the estimated number of share we ultimately expect will vest for our service based award we recognize stock based compensation expense on straight line basis over the service period of the award which is generally four year for our psus we recognize stock based compensation expense on straight line basis over the service period for each separately vesting tranche the performance condition to evaluate attainment of each tranche for each participant are independent of the performance condition for the other tranche we are required to estimate the stock award that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock based compensation expense for the effect of estimated forfeiture of award over the expense recognition period although we estimate the rate of future forfeiture based upon historical experience actual forfeiture in the future may differ to the extent our actual forfeiture are different than our estimate we record true up for the difference in the period that grantee terminates or the award vest and such true ups could materially affect our operating result additionally we also consider on quarterly basis whether there have been any significant change in fact and circumstance that would affect our expected forfeiture rate we estimate the fair value of employee stock option using black scholes merton valuation model the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant well other assumption including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the award and the estimated period of time that we expect employee to hold their stock option the risk free interest rate assumption we use is based upon treasury interest rate appropriate for the expected life of the award we use the implied volatility of publicly traded table of content option in our stock in order to estimate future stock price trend we believe that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trend than historical volatility in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employee to hold their stock option we have used historical rate of employee group by seniority of job classification our expected dividend rate is based upon an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividend declared by our board of director the aforementioned input entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock award are subjective estimate and change to these estimate will cause the fair value of our stock award and related stock based compensation expense that we record to vary we issue psus to certain key executive we estimate the fair value of the psus based upon their intrinsic value of the grant date the vesting condition and related term of the psus were communicated to each participating employee of their respective grant date and include attainment metric that are defined fixed and consistently determined based upon consistent gaap metric or internal metric and that require the employee to render service the performance condition of the psus affect the number of psus that will ultimately vest and be issued to the grantee based upon target that is subject to certain attainment maximum with the possibility that none will vest if applicable performance condition are not met we update the amount of stock based compensation expense net of forfeiture to record of the end of each reporting period based on the expected attainment of performance target which is subject to change until final determination is known change to the target estimate are reflected in the amount of stock based compensation expense that we recognize for each psu tranche on cumulative basis during the reporting period in which the target estimate are altered and may cause the amount of stock based compensation expense that we record for such reporting period to vary we record deferred tax asset for stock based compensation award that result in deduction on our income tax return based on the amount of stock based compensation recognized and the fair value attributable to the vested portion of stock award assumed in connection with business combination at the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive tax deduction because the deferred tax asset we record are based upon the stock based compensation expense in particular jurisdiction the aforementioned input that affect the fair value of our stock award may also indirectly affect our income tax expense in addition difference between the deferred tax asset recognized for financial reporting purpose and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax return are recorded in additional paid in capital to the extent we change the term of our employee stock based compensation program experience market volatility in the pricing of our common stock that increase the implied volatility calculation of publicly traded option in our stock refine different assumption in future period such forfeiture rate or psu target performance attainment that differ from our current estimate or assume stock award from acquired company that are different in nature than our stock award arrangement among other potential impact the stock based compensation expense that we record in future period and the tax benefit that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous reporting period result of operation impact of acquisition the comparability of our operating result in fiscal compared to fiscal wa impacted by our acquisition primarily our acquisition of micros in the second quarter of fiscal and responsys in the third quarter of fiscal the comparability of our operating result in fiscal compared to fiscal wa impacted by our acquisition primarily our acquisition of responsys in the third quarter of fiscal tekelec in the first quarter of fiscal and acme packet in the fourth quarter of fiscal in our discussion of change in our result of operation from fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal we may qualitatively disclose the impact of our acquired product and service for the one year period subsequent to the acquisition date to the growth in certain of our operating segment revenue where such qualitative discussion would be meaningful for an understanding of the factor that influenced the change in our result of operation when material we may also provide quantitative disclosure related to such table of content acquired product and service the contribution of our acquisition to certain of our operating segment revenue margin and expense for each of the respective period comparison generally are not provided in our discussion they either were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these business and operating segment into our existing operation and or were insignificant to our result of operation during the period presented we caution reader that while pre and post acquisition comparison well any quantified amount may provide indication of general trend any acquisition information that we provide ha inherent limitation for the following reason any qualitative and quantitative disclosure can not specifically address or quantify the substantial effect attributable to change in business strategy including our sale force integration effort we believe that if our acquired company had operated independently and sale force had not been integrated the relative mix of product sold would have been different and although substantially all of our software license customer including customer from acquired company renew their software license update and product support contract when the contract are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud saas and paas contract and hardware system support contract the amount shown cloud saas and paas deferred revenue software license update and product support deferred revenue and hardware system support deferred revenue in our supplemental disclosure related to certain charge presented below are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvement we will achieve upon contract renewal to the extent customer do not renew constant currency presentation our international operation have provided and will continue to provide significant portion of our total revenue and expense result total revenue and expense will continue to be affected by change in the dollar against major international currency in order to provide framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuation we compare the percent change in the result from one period to another period in this annual report using constant currency disclosure to present this information current and comparative prior period result for entity reporting in currency other than dollar are converted into dollar at constant exchange rate the rate in effect on may which wa the last day of our prior fiscal year rather than the actual exchange rate in effect during the respective period for example if an entity reporting in euro had revenue of million euro from product sold on may and our financial statement would reflect reported revenue of million in fiscal using the month end average exchange rate for the period and million in fiscal using the month end average exchange rate for the period the constant currency presentation however would translate the fiscal result using the fiscal exchange rate and indicate in this example no change in revenue during the period in each of the table below we present the percent change based on actual unrounded result in reported currency and in constant currency table of

fiscal compared to fiscal were significantly impacted by movement in international currency relative to the dollar which decreased our total revenue by percentage point total operating expense by percentage point and total operating income by percentage point excluding the effect of unfavorable currency variation of percentage point our total revenue increased in fiscal due to revenue increase in our software and cloud and hardware system business the constant currency growth in our software and cloud revenue wa attributable to growth in our software license update and product support revenue growth in our saas paas and iaa revenue and revenue contribution from our recent acquisition the constant currency growth in our hardware system business wa attributable to growth in our hardware system support revenue which were primarily attributable to revenue contribution from our recent acquisition excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuation the america contributed emea contributed and asia pacific contributed to the growth in our total revenue during fiscal excluding the effect of favorable currency variation of percentage point our total operating expense increased during fiscal due to expense increase across all of our line of business the largest of which were due to increased sale and marketing and research and development expense resulting primarily from increased headcount increased cloud saas and paas expense to support the increase in our cloud saas and paas revenue and increased acquisition related and other expense excluding the effect of unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuation of percentage point our fiscal operating margin wa flat in comparison to the prior year while our operating margin percentage of revenue decreased during fiscal our total operating expense increased at faster rate than our total revenue fiscal compared to fiscal on constant currency basis our total revenue increased in fiscal due to increase in our software and cloud business revenue and our hardware system business revenue partially offset by decrease in our service business revenue the constant currency revenue growth in our table of content software and cloud business wa substantially attributable to growth in our software license update and product support revenue and to lesser extent growth in our cloud saas and paas revenue due to incremental revenue from our acquisition the constant currency revenue growth in our hardware business wa due to an increase in our hardware system support revenue due substantially to incremental revenue from our acquisition and due to increase in our hardware revenue attributable to our oracle engineered system on constant currency basis the america contributed emea contributed and asia pacific contributed to our total revenue growth during fiscal total constant currency operating expense increased during fiscal primarily due to an increase in sale and marketing and research and development expense resulting from increased headcount increased sale based variable compensation expense due to revenue growth and increased cloud saas and paas expense to support the increase in our cloud saas and paas revenue these expense increase in fiscal were partially offset by lower constant currency expense in fiscal from our hardware system support and service segment due to decreased headcount lower restructuring expense and lower intangible asset amortization in fiscal we recognized million acquisition related benefit related to change in estimate for contingent consideration payable refer to note of note to consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information and million benefit relating to certain litigation refer to note of note to consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information both of which decreased our acquisition related and other expense during this period excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuation our operating margin increased during fiscal due to our revenue growth while our operating margin percentage of revenue wa flat supplemental disclosure related to certain charge to supplement our consolidated financial information we believe the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospect for the future you should review the introduction under impact of acquisition above for discussion of the inherent limitation in comparing pre and post acquisition information our

foreign currency borrowing and related hedge in july we issued billion of note due january january note and we entered into certain cross currency swap agreement to manage the related foreign exchange

january note decreased by basis point of may we estimate the change would decrease the fair value of the cross currency swap agreement by million additional detail regarding our senior note and related cross currency swap agreement are included in note and of note to consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report in july we also issued million of note due july note we designated the note net investment hedge of our investment in certain of our international subsidiary that use the euro their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholder equity caused by the change in foreign currency exchange rate of the euro with respect to the dollar result the change in the carrying value of the euro denominated note due to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate on the effective portion is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and is also presented line item in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this annual report and totaled million of net other comprehensive gain for fiscal any remaining change in the carrying value of the note representing the ineffective portion of the net investment hedge is recognized in non operating income expense net we did not record any ineffectiveness during fiscal fluctuation in the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar will impact the amount of dollar that we will require to settle the note at maturity if the dollar weakened by in comparison to the euro of may we estimate our obligation to cash settle the principal portion of the note in dollar would increase by approximately million foreign currency transaction risk foreign currency forward contract we transact business in various foreign currency and have established program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contract to offset the risk associated with the effect of certain foreign currency exposure under this program our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contract so that increase or decrease in our foreign currency exposure are offset by gain or loss on the foreign currency forward contract in order to mitigate the risk and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction we may suspend this program from time to time our foreign currency exposure typically arise from intercompany sublicense fee intercompany loan and other intercompany transaction our foreign currency forward contract are generally short term in duration we neither use these foreign currency forward contract for trading purpose nor do we designate these forward contract hedging instrument pursuant to asc accordingly we record the fair value of these contract of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with change in fair value recorded to our consolidated statement of operation given the short duration of the forward contract the amount recorded is table of content not significant the balance sheet classification for the fair value of these forward contract is prepaid expense and other current asset for net unrealized gain position and other current liability for net unrealized loss position the statement of operation classification for change in fair value of these forward contract is non operating income expense net for both realized and unrealized gain and loss we expect that we will continue to realize gain or loss with respect to our foreign currency exposure net of gain or loss from our foreign currency forward contract our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposure will generally depend on the size and type of cross currency transaction that we enter into the currency exchange rate associated with these exposure and change in those rate the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contract and other factor of may and the notional amount of the forward contract we held to purchase dollar in exchange for other major international currency were billion and billion respectively of may and the notional amount of forward contract we held to sell dollar in exchange for other major international currency were billion and billion respectively the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contract were nominal at may and net foreign exchange transaction loss included

loss for fiscal fiscal and fiscal were foreign currency remeasurement loss relating to our venezuelan subsidiary operation of million million and million respectively see note of note to consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information large portion of our consolidated operation are international we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future the amount and timing of which are unknown foreign currency translation risk impact on cash cash equivalent and marketable security fluctuation in foreign currency impact the amount of total asset and liability that we report for our foreign subsidiary upon the translation of these amount into dollar in particular the amount of cash cash equivalent and marketable security that we report in dollar for significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiary is subject to translation variance caused by change in foreign currency exchange rate of the end of each respective reporting period the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and is also presented line item in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this annual report the dollar fluctuated against certain international currency of the end of fiscal the amount of cash cash equivalent and marketable security that we reported in dollar for foreign subsidiary that hold international currency of may decreased relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rate of may reported in our consolidated statement of cash flow the estimated effect of exchange rate change on our reported cash and cash equivalent balance in dollar for fiscal and were decrease of billion

amount of new software license revenue to be recognized pursuant to asc under the residual method if fair value exists for undelivered element in multiple element arrangement such fair value of the undelivered element is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the software license we allocate the fair value of each element of software related multiple element arrangement based upon it fair value determined by our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe described further below with any remaining amount allocated to the software license revenue recognition for cloud saas paas and iaa offering hardware system product hardware system support and related service nonsoftware element our revenue recognition policy for nonsoftware deliverable including cloud saas paas and iaa offering hardware system product support and related service is based upon the accounting guidance contained in asc revenue recognition multiple element arrangement and we exercise judgment and use estimate in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud saas paas and iaa revenue hardware system product revenue support and related service revenue to be recognized in each accounting period revenue from the sale of our nonsoftware element are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we deliver the product and passage of the title to the buyer occurs the sale price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured revenue that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing condition are not met are recognized when those condition are subsequently met when applicable we reduce revenue for estimated return or certain other incentive program where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effect of these item where an arrangement is subject to acceptance criterion and the acceptance provision are not perfunctory for example acceptance provision that are long term in nature or are not included standard term of an arrangement revenue are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period our cloud saas and paas offering generally provide customer access to certain of our software within cloud based it environment that we manage host and support and offer to customer on subscription basis revenue for our cloud saas and paas offering are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customer and all other revenue recognition criterion have been satisfied table of content oracle corporation note to consolidated financial statement continued may our cloud iaa offering provide deployment and management offering

of our oracle engineered system computer server storage networking and industry specific hardware our hardware system support offering generally provide customer with software update for the software component that are essential to the functionality of our hardware product and can also include product repair maintenance service and technical support service hardware system support contract are generally priced percentage of the net hardware system product fee hardware system support contract are entered into at the customer option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement which are typically one year revenue recognition for multiple element arrangement cloud saas paas and iaa offering hardware system product hardware system support and related service nonsoftware arrangement we enter into arrangement with customer that purchase both nonsoftware related product and service from at the same time or within close proximity of one another referred to nonsoftware multiple element arrangement each element within nonsoftware multiple element arrangement is accounted for separate unit of accounting provided the following criterion are met the delivered product or service have value to the customer on standalone basis and for an arrangement that includes general right of return relative to the delivered product or service delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by we consider deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by or another vendor or could be resold by the customer further our revenue arrangement generally do not include general right of return relative to the delivered product where the aforementioned criterion for separate unit of accounting are not met the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element and treated single unit of accounting for the purpose of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition for those unit of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated single unit of accounting we generally recognize revenue over the contractual period of the arrangement or in the case of our cloud offering we generally recognize revenue over the contractual term of the cloud software subscription for the purpose of revenue classification of the element that are accounted for single unit of accounting we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line item within our consolidated statement of operation based on rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling price of such element for our nonsoftware multiple element arrangement we allocate revenue to each element based on selling price hierarchy at the arrangement inception the selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy vsoe if available third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available description to how we determine vsoe tpe and esp is provided below if tangible hardware system product includes software we determine whether the tangible hardware system product and the software work together to deliver the product essential functionality and if so the entire product is treated nonsoftware deliverable the total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverable using the relative selling price of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy we limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered element to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional product or service or meeting of any specified performance condition table of content oracle corporation note to consolidated financial statement continued may when possible we establish vsoe of selling price for deliverable in software and nonsoftware multiple element arrangement using the price charged for deliverable when sold separately and for software license update and product support and hardware system support based on the renewal rate offered to customer tpe is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor product or service in standalone arrangement with similarly situated customer if we are unable to determine the selling price because vsoe or tpe doe not exist we determine esp for the purpose of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transaction including transaction whereby the deliverable wa sold on standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factor including but not limited to pricing practice including discounting margin objective competition contractually stated price the geography in which we offer our product and service the type of customer distributor value added reseller government agency and direct end user among others and the stage of the product lifecycle the determination of esp is made through consultation with and approval by our management taking into consideration our pricing model and go to market strategy our or our competitor pricing and go to market strategy evolve we may modify our pricing practice in the future which could result in change to our determination of vsoe tpe and esp result our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangement could differ materially from our result in the current period selling price are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant change in our selling price revenue recognition policy applicable to both software and nonsoftware element revenue recognition for multiple element arrangement arrangement with software and nonsoftware element we also enter into multiple element arrangement that may include combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related product and service offering including new software license software license update and product support cloud saas paas and iaa offering hardware system product hardware system support consulting advanced customer support service and education in such arrangement we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the software group of element whole and to the nonsoftware element we then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective element within that group following the guidance in asc and our policy described above after the arrangement consideration ha been allocated to the element we account for each respective element in the arrangement described above other revenue recognition policy applicable to software and nonsoftware element many of our software arrangement include consulting implementation service sold separately under consulting engagement contract and are included part of our service business consulting revenue from these arrangement are generally accounted for separately from new software license revenue because the arrangement qualify service transaction defined in asc the more significant factor considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of service consideration of whether the service are essential to the functionality of the licensed product degree of risk availability of service from other vendor timing of payment and impact of milestone or acceptance criterion on the realizability of the software license fee revenue for consulting service are generally recognized the service are performed if there is significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting service revenue are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved we estimate the proportional performance on contract with fixed or not to exceed fee on monthly basis utilizing hour incurred to date percentage of total estimated hour to complete the project if we do not have sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenue are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that the service have been completed when total cost estimate exceed revenue we accrue for the estimated loss immediately using cost estimate that are based upon an average fully table of content oracle corporation note to consolidated financial statement continued may burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the service the complexity of the estimation process and factor relating to the assumption risk and uncertainty inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affect the amount of revenue and related expense reported in our consolidated financial

support service are offered standalone arrangement or part of arrangement to customer buying other software and non software product and service we offer these advanced support service both on premise and remote to oracle customer to enable increased performance and higher availability of their product and service depending upon the nature of the arrangement revenue from these service are recognized the service are performed or ratably over the term of the service period which is generally one year or le education revenue are also part of our service business and include instructor led medium based and internet based training in the use of our software and hardware product education revenue are recognized the class or other education offering are delivered if an arrangement contains multiple element and doe not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transaction then new software license revenue and or hardware system product revenue including the cost of hardware system product are generally recognized together with the service based on contract accounting using either the percentage of completion or completed contract method contract accounting is applied to any bundled software and cloud hardware system and service arrangement that include milestone or customer specific acceptance criterion that may affect collection of the software license or hardware system product fee where consulting service include significant modification or customization of the software or hardware system product or are of specialized nature and generally performed only by oracle where significant consulting service are provided for in the software license contract or hardware system product contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted or where the software license or hardware system product payment is tied to the performance of consulting service for the purpose of revenue classification of the element that are accounted for single unit of accounting we allocate revenue to software and nonsoftware element based on rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of the relative selling price of such element we also evaluate arrangement with governmental entity containing fiscal funding or termination for convenience provision when such provision are required by law to determine the probability of possible cancellation we consider multiple factor including the history with the customer in similar transaction the essential use of the software or hardware system product and the planning budgeting and approval process undertaken by the governmental entity if we determine upon execution of these arrangement that the likelihood of cancellation is remote we then recognize revenue once all of the criterion described above have been met if such determination can not be made revenue are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity we ass whether fee are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenue if all other revenue recognition requirement are met our standard payment term are net day however payment term may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed payment that are due within six month are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangement and thereby satisfy the required criterion for revenue recognition while most of our arrangement for sale within our business include short term payment term we

receivables true sale defined in asc transfer and servicing we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables during fiscal and billion billion and billion of our financing receivables were sold to financial institution respectively in addition we enter into arrangement with leasing company for the sale of our hardware system product these leasing company in turn lease our product to end user the leasing company generally have no recourse to in the event of default by the end user and we recognize revenue upon delivery if all other revenue recognition criterion have been met our customer include several of our supplier and occasionally we have purchased good or service for our operation from these vendor at or about the same time that we have sold our product to these same company concurrent transaction software license agreement or sale of hardware system that occur within three month time period from the date we have purchased good or service from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure when we acquire good or service from customer we negotiate the purchase separately from any sale transaction at term we consider to be at arm length and settle the purchase in cash we recognize revenue from concurrent transaction if all of our revenue recognition criterion are met and the good and service acquired are necessary for our current operation business combination we apply the provision of asc business combination in the accounting for our acquisition it requires to recognize separately from goodwill the
