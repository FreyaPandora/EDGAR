regulatory requirement regarding performance safety and quality of our product authorization to commercially distribute new medical device in the is generally obtained in one of two way the first known pre market notification or the process requires to demonstrate that our new medical device is substantially equivalent to legally marketed medical device the second more rigorous process known pre market approval requires to independently demonstrate that medical device is safe and effective for it intended use this process is generally much more time consuming and expensive than the process in the single regulatory approval process exists and conformity with the legal requirement is represented by the ce mark to obtain ce mark defined product must meet minimum standard of performance safety and quality the essential requirement and then according to their classification comply with one or more of selection of conformity assessment route the competent authority of the country separately regulate the clinical research for medical device and the market surveillance of product once they are placed on the market new medical device regulation wa published by the in

other country have expanded or plan to expand their existing regulation while harmonization of global regulation ha been pursued requirement continue to differ significantly among country we expect

business our business financial condition operating result cash flow and prospect could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risk or uncertainty of contentsrisks relating to the companywe operate in highly competitive industry and we may be unable to compete effectively we compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical market in more than country throughout the world these market are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advance and scientific discovery in the product line in which we compete we face range of competitor from large company with multiple business line to small specialized manufacturer that offer limited selection of niche product development by other company of new or improved product process technology or the introduction of reprocessed product or generic version when our proprietary product lose their patent protection may make our existing or planned product le competitive in addition we face competition from provider of alternative medical therapy such pharmaceutical company we believe our ability to compete depends upon many factor both within and beyond our control including product performance and reliability product technology and innovation product quality and safety breadth of product line product support service customer support cost effectiveness and price and reimbursement approval from health care insurance provider competition may increase additional company enter our market or modify their existing product to compete directly with in addition academic institution governmental agency and other public and private research organization also may conduct research seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangement for discovery research clinical development and marketing of product similar to ours these company and institution compete with in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel well in acquiring necessary product technology from time to time we have lost and may in the future lose market share in connection with product problem physician advisory safety alert and publication about our product which highlight the importance of product quality product efficacy and quality system to our business in the current environment of managed care consolidation among health care provider increased competition and declining reimbursement rate we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price further our continued growth and success depend on our ability to develop acquire and market new and differentiated product technology and intellectual property and result we also face competition for marketing distribution and collaborative development agreement establishing relationship with academic and research institution and license to intellectual property in order to continue to compete effectively we must continue to create invest in or acquire advanced technology incorporate this technology into our proprietary product obtain regulatory approval in timely manner and manufacture and successfully market our product given these factor we can not guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively or continue our level of success reduction or interruption in supply or other manufacturing difficulty may adversely affect our manufacturing operation and related product sale the manufacture of our product requires the timely delivery of sufficient amount of quality component and material and is highly exacting and complex due in part to strict regulatory requirement we manufacture the majority of our product at numerous manufacturing facility worldwide we purchase many of the component and raw material used in manufacturing these product from numerous supplier in various country we have generally been able to obtain adequate supply of such raw material and component however for reason of quality assurance cost effectiveness or availability certain component and raw material used in our product are obtained from sole supplier although we work closely with our supplier to try to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability the supply of these component and raw material may be interrupted or insufficient in addition due to the stringent regulation and requirement of regulatory agency including the fda regarding the manufacture of our product we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement source furthermore the price of commodity and other material used in our product which are often volatile and outside of our control could adversely impact our supply we use resin other petroleum based material and pulp raw material in some of our product and the price of oil and gas also significantly affect our cost for freight and utility reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative source for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our product in timely or cost effective manner and could result in lost sale other disruption in the manufacturing process or product sale and fulfillment system for any reason including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocol and procedure defective raw material natural disaster such hurricane tornado or wildfire and other environmental factor could lead to launch delay product shortage unanticipated cost lost revenue and damage to our reputation for example in june we experienced global information technology system of contentsinterruption that affected our customer ordering distribution and manufacturing process furthermore any failure to identify and address manufacturing problem prior to the release of product to our customer could result in quality or safety issue in addition several of our key product are manufactured at particular manufacturing facility with limited alternate facility if an event occurs that result in damage to one or more of such facility such the damage caused by hurricane maria in puerto rico in september we may be unable to manufacture the relevant product at the previous level or at all because of the time required to approve and license manufacturing facility third party manufacturer may not be available on timely basis to replace production capacity in the event manufacturing capacity is lost we are subject to costly and complex law and governmental regulation and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operation our medical device and technology well our business activity are subject to complex set of regulation and rigorous enforcement including by the fda department of justice health and human service office of the inspector general and numerous other federal state and non governmental authority to varying degree each of these agency requires to comply with law and regulation governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our product part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new product and new indication for existing product we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trial with variety of study design patient population and trial endpoint unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trial or the market or fda perception of this clinical data may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approval our position in and share of the market in which we participate and our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow we can not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain marketing clearance for our new product or enhancement or modification to existing product and the failure to maintain approval or obtain approval or clearance could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow even if we are able to obtain approval or clearance may take significant amount of time require the expenditure of substantial resource involve stringent clinical and pre clinical testing well increased post market surveillance involve modification repair or replacement of our product and limit the proposed us of our product both before and after product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibility under fda and other applicable non government agency regulation for instance many of our facility and procedure and those of our supplier are also subject to periodic inspection by the fda to determine compliance with applicable regulation the result of these inspection can include inspectional observation on fda form warning letter or other form of enforcement if the fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable law or regulation or that any of our medical product are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the fda could ban such medical product detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical product order recall repair replacement or refund of such product refuse to grant pending pre market approval application or require certificate of non government for export and or require to notify health professional and others that the device present unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health the fda and other non government agency may also ass civil or criminal penalty against our officer or employee and impose operating restriction on company wide basis the fda may also recommend prosecution to the department of justice any adverse regulatory action depending on it magnitude may restrict from effectively marketing and selling our product and limit our ability to obtain future pre market clearance or approval and could result in substantial modification to our business practice and operation furthermore we occasionally receive subpoena or other request for information from state and federal governmental agency and while these investigation typically relate primarily to financial arrangement with health care provider regulatory compliance and product promotional practice we can not predict the timing outcome or impact of any such investigation any adverse outcome in one or more of these investigation could include the commencement of civil and or criminal proceeding substantial fine penalty and or administrative remedy including exclusion from government reimbursement program and or entry into corporate integrity agreement cia with governmental agency in addition resolution of any of these matter could involve the imposition of additional costly compliance obligation these potential consequence well any adverse outcome from government investigation could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow in addition the fda ha taken the position that device manufacturer are prohibited from promoting their product other than for the us and indication set forth in the approved product labeling and any failure to comply could subject to significant civil or criminal exposure administrative obligation and cost and or other potential penalty from and or agreement with the federal government governmental regulation outside the have and may continue to become increasingly stringent and common in the european union for example new medical device regulation wa published in which when it enters into full force in will of contentsinclude significant additional premarket and post market requirement penalty for regulatory non compliance could be severe including fine and revocation or suspension of company business license mandatory price reduction and criminal sanction future law and regulation may have material adverse effect on our failure to comply with law and regulation relating to reimbursement of health care good and service may subject to penalty and adversely impact our reputation business result of operation financial condition and cash flow our device product and therapy are purchased principally by hospital or physician that typically bill various third party payer such governmental program medicare medicaid and comparable non program private insurance plan and managed care plan for the healthcare service provided to their patient the ability of our customer to obtain appropriate reimbursement for product and service from third party payer is critical because it affect which product customer purchase and the price they are willing to pay result our device product and therapy are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by hhs including the center for medicare medicaid service cm well comparable state and non agency responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care good and service including law and regulation related to kickback false claim self referral and health care fraud many state have similar law that apply to reimbursement by state medicaid and other funded program well in some case to all payer in certain circumstance insurance company can attempt to bring private cause of action against manufacturer for causing false claim to be filed under the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organization act in addition manufacturer of fda approved device reimbursable by federal healthcare program we are subject to the physician payment sunshine act which requires to annually report certain payment and other transfer of value we make to licensed physician or teaching hospital any failure to comply with these law and regulation could subject or our officer and employee to criminal and civil financial penalty we are also subject to risk relating to change in government and private medical reimbursement program and policy and change in legal regulatory requirement in the and around the world implementation of further legislative or administrative reform to these reimbursement system or adverse decision relating to coverage of or reimbursement for our product by administrator of these system could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our product and the price that our customer are willing to pay for them we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary right and failing to protect such right or to be successful in litigation related to our right or the right of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damage and or royalty payment negatively impact our ability to sell current or future product or prohibit from enforcing our patent and other proprietary right against others we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary right and rely on combination of patent trade secret and non disclosure and non competition agreement to protect our proprietary intellectual property we also operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation patent litigation can result in significant damage award and injunction that could prevent our manufacture and sale of affected product or require to pay significant royalty in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected product at any given time we are generally involved both plaintiff and defendant in number of patent infringement action the outcome of which may not be known for prolonged period of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation it is possible that the result of such litigation could require to pay significant monetary damage and or royalty payment negatively impact our ability to sell current or future product or prohibit from enforcing our patent and proprietary right against others any of which could have material adverse impact on our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow while we intend to defend against any threat to our intellectual property our patent trade secret or other agreement may not adequately protect our intellectual property further pending patent application may not result in patent being issued to patent issued to or licensed by may be challenged or circumvented by competitor and such patent may be found invalid unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or provide with any competitive advantage third party could obtain patent that may require to negotiate license to conduct our business and these license may not be available on reasonable term or at all we also rely on non disclosure and non competition agreement with certain employee consultant and other party to protect in part trade secret and other proprietary right we can not be certain that these agreement will not be breached that we will have adequate remedy for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third party will not otherwise gain access to our trade secret or proprietary knowledge in addition the law of certain country in which we market some of our product do not protect our intellectual property right to the extent the law of the which could make it easier for competitor to capture market position in those country competitor also may harm our sale by designing product that mirror the capability of our product or technology without infringing our intellectual property right if we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these country it could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow of contentsquality problem and product liability claim could lead to recall or safety alert reputational harm adverse verdict or costly settlement and could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow quality is extremely important to and our customer due to the serious and costly consequence of product failure and our business expose to potential product liability risk that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical device in addition many of our product are often used in intensive care setting with seriously ill patient and some of the medical device we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long period of time or indefinitely component failure manufacturing defect design flaw label use or inadequate disclosure of product related risk or product related information with respect to our product could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of patient these problem could lead to recall of or issuance of safety alert relating to our product and could result in product liability claim and lawsuit including class action which could ultimately result in certain case in the removal from the body of such product and claim regarding cost associated therewith due to the strong name recognition of the medtronic and covidien brand material adverse event involving one of our product could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all product within that brand and could harm our reputation and ability to market product in the future strong product quality is critical to the success of our good and service if we fail to meet these standard and our product are the subject of recall or safety alert our reputation could be damaged we could lose customer and our revenue and result of operation could decline our success also can depend on our ability to manufacture to exact specification precision engineered component subassemblies and finished device from multiple material if our component fail to meet these standard or fail to adapt to evolving standard our reputation competitive advantage and market share could be harmed in certain situation we may undertake voluntary recall of product or temporarily shut production line based on performance relative to our own internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data any of the foregoing problem including future product liability claim or recall regardless of their ultimate outcome could harm our reputation and have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow our research and development effort rely upon investment and investment collaboration and we can not guarantee that any previous or future investment or investment collaboration will be successful our mission is to provide broad range of therapy to restore patient to fuller healthier life which requires wide variety of technology product and capability the rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different area of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop broad portfolio of technological solution in addition to internally generated growth through our research and development effort historically we have relied and expect to continue to rely upon investment and investment collaboration to provide access to new technology both in area served by our existing business well in new area we expect to make future investment where we believe that we can stimulate the development or acquisition of new technology and product to further our strategic objective and strengthen our existing business investment and investment collaboration in and with medical technology company are inherently risky and we can not guarantee that any of our previous or future investment or investment collaboration will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow health care policy change may have material adverse effect on in response to perceived increase in health care cost in recent year there have been and continue to be proposal by the federal government state government regulator and third party payer to control these cost and more generally to reform the health care system including health care reform legislation certain of these proposal could among other thing limit the price we are able to charge for our product or the amount of reimbursement available for our product and could limit the acceptance and availability of our product the adoption of some or all of these proposal could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow our insurance program may not be adequate to cover future loss we have elected to self insure most of our insurable risk across the company and we made this decision based on cost and availability factor in the insurance marketplace we manage and maintain portion of our self insured program through wholly owned captive insurance company we continue to maintain director and officer liability insurance policy with third party insurer that provides coverage for the director and officer of the company we continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value of obtaining insurance coverage for other category of loss in the future although we believe based on historical loss trend that our self insurance program accrual and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future loss historical trend may not be indicative of future loss the absence of third party insurance coverage for other category of loss increase our exposure to unanticipated claim and these loss could have material adverse impact on our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow of contentsif we experience decreasing price for our good and service and we are unable to reduce our expense there may be material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow we have experienced and may continue to experience decreasing price for our good and service due to pricing pressure from managed care organization and other third party payer on our customer increased market power of our customer the medical device industry consolidates and increased competition among medical engineering and manufacturing service provider if the price for our good and service decrease and we are unable to reduce our expense our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow will be adversely affected we are subject to variety of risk associated with global operation that could adversely affect our profitability and operating result we develop manufacture distribute and sell our product globally operation in country outside of the are accompanied by certain risk we intend to continue to expand our operation and to pursue growth opportunity outside the especially in emerging market which could expose to additional and greater risk our profitability and global operation are and will continue to be subject to number of risk and potential cost including fluctuation in currency exchange rate healthcare reform legislation the need to comply with different regulatory regime worldwide that are subject to change and that could restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our product local product preference and product requirement longer term receivables than are typical in the trade protection measure tariff and other border tax and import or export licensing requirement le intellectual property protection in some country outside the than exists in the different labor regulation and workforce instability political and economic instability the expiration and non renewal of foreign tax ruling and or grant potentially negative consequence from change in or interpretation of tax law and economic instability and inflation recession or interest rate fluctuation on june the held referendum in which voter approved an exit from the commonly referred to brexit result of the referendum it is expected that the british government will begin negotiating the term of the future relationship with the although it is unknown those term will be it is possible that there will be greater restriction on import and export between the and country and increased regulatory complexity similarly from time to time proposal are made in the to significantly change existing trade agreement and relationship between the and other country although we can not currently predict whether or these change will be implemented change to trade policy may adversely affect our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow in addition significant amount of our trade receivables are with national health care system in many country repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the political and financial stability of those country in light of these global economic fluctuation we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of customer failure to receive payment of all or significant portion of these receivables could adversely affect our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow finally change in currency exchange rate may impact the reported value of our revenue expense and cash flow we can not predict change in currency exchange rate the impact of exchange rate change the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate change the failure to comply with anti bribery law could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil and or criminal sanction the foreign corrupt practice act fcpa and similar anti bribery law in non jurisdiction generally prohibit company and their intermediary from making improper payment to non government official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business because of the predominance of government administered healthcare system in many jurisdiction around the world many of our customer relationship outside of the are with governmental entity and are therefore potentially subject to such law we also participate in public private partnership and other commercial and policy arrangement with government around the globe global enforcement of anti corruption law ha increased substantially in recent year with more frequent voluntary self disclosure by company aggressive investigation and enforcement proceeding by and non governmental agency and assessment of significant fine and penalty against company and individual our international operation create the risk of unauthorized payment or offer of payment by one of our employee consultant sale agent or distributor it is our policy of contentsto implement safeguard to educate our employee and agent on these legal requirement and prohibit improper practice however existing safeguard and any future improvement may not always be effective and our employee consultant sale agent or distributor may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible in addition the government may seek to hold liable for fcpa violation committed by company in which we invest or that we acquire any alleged or actual violation of these regulation may subject to government scrutiny criminal or civil sanction

impact our operation from time to time certain of our subsidiary have limited business dealing in country subject to comprehensive sanction including iran sudan syria cuba and the region of crimea certain of our subsidiary sell medical device and may provide related service to distributor and other purchasing body in such country these business dealing represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenue and income but expose to heightened risk of violating applicable sanction regulation violation of these regulation are punishable by civil penalty including fine denial of export privilege injunction asset seizure debarment from government contract and revocation or restriction of license well criminal fine and imprisonment we have established policy and procedure designed to assist with our compliance with such law and regulation however there can be no assurance that our policy and procedure will prevent from violating these regulation in every transaction in which we may engage and such violation could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition result of operation and cash flow consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenue and result of operation many health care industry company including health care system distributor manufacturer provider and insurer are consolidating or have formed strategic alliance the health care industry consolidates competition to provide good and service to industry participant will become more intense further this consolidation creates larger enterprise with greater negotiating power which they can use to negotiate price concession if we must reduce our price because of industry consolidation or if we lose customer result of consolidation our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow could be adversely affected health care industry cost containment measure could result in reduced sale of our medical device and medical device component most of our customer and the health care provider to our customer supply medical device rely on third party payer including government program and private health insurance plan to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedure in which medical device that incorporate component we manufacture or assemble are used the continuing effort of governmental authority insurance company and other payer of health care cost to contain or reduce these cost could lead to patient being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third party payer if third party payer payment approval can not be obtained by patient sale of finished medical device that include our component may decline significantly and our customer may reduce or eliminate purchase of our component the cost containment measure that health care provider are instituting both in the and outside of the could harm our ability to operate profitably for example managed care organization have successfully negotiated volume discount for pharmaceutical and gpo and idns have also concentrated purchasing decision for some customer which ha led to downward pricing pressure for medical device company including we are subject to environmental law and regulation and the risk of environmental liability violation and litigation we are subject to numerous federal state local and non environmental health and safety law and regulation concerning among other thing the health and safety of our employee the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous material emission or discharge of substance into the

their property or at property which they have disposed of hazardous substance in addition to cleanup action brought by governmental authority private party could bring personal injury or other claim due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substance the ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash outflow is difficult to predict given the uncertainty regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable law and regulation and alternative cleanup method the cost of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety law and regulation or liability arising from past or future release of or exposure to hazardous substance may exceed our estimate or have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow the continuing development of many of our product depends upon maintaining strong relationship with health care professional if we fail to maintain our working relationship with health care professional many of our product may not be developed and marketed in line with the need and expectation of the professional who use and support our product which could cause decline in our earnings and profitability the research development marketing and sale of many of our new and improved product depends on our maintaining working relationship with health care professional we rely on these professional to provide with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development marketing and sale of our product physician assist researcher marketing and product

the past have experienced attempted or actual interference with the integrity of and interruption in our technology system well data breach such cyber attack malicious intrusion breakdown interference with the integrity of our product and data or other significant disruption furthermore we rely on third party vendor to supply and or support certain aspect of our information technology system these third party system could also become vulnerable to cyber attack malicious intrusion breakdown interference or other significant disruption and may contain defect in design or manufacture or other problem that could result in system disruption or compromise the information security of our own system in addition we continue to grow in part through new business acquisition and result may face risk associated with defect and vulnerability in their system or difficulty or other breakdown or disruption in connection with the integration of the acquisition into our information technology system our worldwide operation mean that we are subject to law and regulation including data protection and cybersecurity law and regulation in many jurisdiction the variety of and international

large company or incident arising from other cyber attack any data security breach cyber attack malicious intrusion or significant disruption could result in action by regulatory body and or civil litigation any of which could materially and adversely affect our business result of operation financial condition cash flow reputation or competitive position in addition our information technology system require an ongoing commitment of significant resource to maintain protect and enhance existing system and develop new system to keep pace with continuing change in information processing technology evolving legal and regulatory standard the increasing need to protect patient and customer information change in the technique used to obtain unauthorized access to data and information system and the information technology need associated with our changing product and service there can be no assurance that our process of consolidating protecting upgrading and expanding our system and capability continuing to build security into the design of our product and developing new system to keep pace with continuing change in information processing technology will be successful or that additional system issue will not arise in the future of contentsif our information technology system product or service or sensitive data are compromised patient or employee could be exposed to

controlling fraud be exposed to the loss or misuse of confidential information have dispute with customer physician and other health care professional suffer regulatory sanction or penalty under federal law state law or the law of other jurisdiction experience increase in operating expense or an impairment in our ability to conduct our operation incur expense or lose revenue result of data privacy breach product failure information technology outage or disruption or suffer other adverse consequence including lawsuit or other legal action and damage to our reputation our substantial leverage and debt service obligation could adversely affect our business at april we had approximately billion of current debt obligation and billion of long term debt outstanding we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequence including making it more difficult for to satisfy our financial obligation increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic regulatory and industry condition and placing at disadvantage compared to our competitor that are le leveraged limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for or reacting to change in our business and the industry in which we operate limiting our ability to borrow additional fund for working capital capital expenditure acquisition and general corporate or other purpose and exposing to greater interest rate risk since the interest rate on borrowing under our floating rate note and revolving credit facility is variable our debt service obligation require to use portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness instead of for other corporate purpose including funding future expansion of our business acquisition and ongoing capital expenditure which could impede our growth if our operating cash flow and capital resource are insufficient to service our debt obligation we may be forced to sell asset seek additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt which could harm our long term business prospect our failure to comply with the term of our revolving credit facility and other indebtedness could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt failure to integrate acquired business into our operation successfully could adversely affect our business part of our strategy to develop and identify new product and technology we have made several significant acquisition in recent year and may make additional acquisition in the future our integration of the operation of acquired business requires significant effort including the coordination of information technology research and development sale and marketing operation manufacturing and finance these effort result in additional expense and involve significant amount of management time that can not then be dedicated to other project our failure to manage and coordinate the growth of acquired company successfully could also have an adverse impact on our business in addition we can not be certain that the business we acquire will become profitable or remain so factor that will affect the success of our acquisition include the presence or absence of adequate internal control and or significant fraud in the financial system of acquired company our ability or inability to integrate information technology system of acquired company in secure and reliable manner adverse development arising of investigation by governmental entity of the business practice of acquired company including potential fcpa liability any decrease in customer loyalty and product order caused by dissatisfaction with the combined company product line and sale and marketing practice including price increase our ability to retain key employee and the ability to achieve synergy among acquired company such increasing sale of the integrated company product achieving cost saving and effectively combining technology to develop new product we also could experience negative effect on our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow from acquisition related charge amortization of intangible asset and asset impairment charge these effect individually or in the aggregate could cause deterioration of our credit rating and result in increased borrowing cost and interest expense of contentschanges in tax law or exposure to additional income tax liability could have material impact on our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow we are subject to income tax well non income based tax in the ireland and various other jurisdiction in which we operate the tax law in the ireland and other country in which we and our affiliate do business could change on prospective or retroactive basis and any such change could materially adversely affect our business and our effective tax rate for example on december the enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to the tax cut and job act the tax act which resulted in significant charge to tax expense during our quarter ending january associated with the taxation of accumulated foreign earnings well the requirement to revalue deferred tax asset and liability resulting from the reduction in the corporate tax rate certain element of the tax act impact fiscal year while other portion of the legislation are not effective until future fiscal year the treasury ha issued additional guidance subsequent to the enactment of the tax act and we expect ongoing guidance to be provided which could change the impact on our tax reserve we made reasonable estimate of the effect of the tax act and recorded provisional amount in the financial statement for fiscal year additional guidance well future change to these rule may result in adjustment to these estimate which could materially affect our financial result in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd published an action plan called base erosion and profit shifting beps with view to tackling perceived tax abuse and inconsistency between taxing authority and their approach to international tax matter the final beps action report wa published in october and subsequently many taxing authority have adopted the guideline provided within their local law the eu expanded upon these guideline with anti tax avoidance directive atad to be applied by it member state we continue to monitor any and all change to local country legislation resulting from this guidance one specific change is requirement for increased disclosure of financial information on local and global basis this information could lead to disagreement between jurisdiction associated with the proper allocation of profit between such jurisdiction we are subject to ongoing tax audit in the various jurisdiction in which we operate tax authority may disagree with certain position we have taken and ass additional tax we regularly ass the likely outcome of these audit in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcome of these audit and the actual outcome of these audit could have material impact on our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow we have recorded reserve for potential payment of tax to various tax authority related to uncertain tax position however the calculation of such tax liability involves the application of complex tax regulation in many jurisdiction therefore any dispute with tax authority may result in payment that is significantly different from current estimate if payment of these amount ultimately prof to be le than the recorded amount the reversal of the liability generally would result in tax benefit being recognized in the period when we determine the liability are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liability prof to be le than the amount for which it is ultimately liable we would incur additional charge and such charge could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow the medtronic inc tax court proceeding outcome could have material adverse impact on our financial condition in march the irs issued it audit report for medtronic inc for fiscal year and medtronic inc reached agreement with the irs on some but not all matter related to these fiscal year the remaining unresolved issue for fiscal year and relates to the allocation of income between medtronic inc and it wholly owned subsidiary operating in puerto rico which is one of our key manufacturing site an adverse outcome in this matter could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow see note to the consolidated financial statement in item financial statement and supplementary data in this annual report on form future potential change to the tax law could result in being treated corporation for federal tax purpose and the irs may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated foreign corporation for federal income tax purpose because medtronic plc is organized under the law of ireland we would generally be classified foreign corporation under the general rule that corporation is considered tax resident in the jurisdiction of it organization or incorporation for federal income tax purpose even so the irs may assert that we should be treated corporation and therefore tax resident for federal income tax purpose pursuant to section of the internal revenue code of amended the code under section of the code if medtronic inc shareholder immediately prior to the covidien transaction held or more of the vote or value of our share by reason of holding stock in medtronic inc immediately after the transaction the ownership of contentstest and our expanded affiliated group after the transaction did not have substantial business activity in ireland relative to it worldwide activity the substantial business activity test we would have been treated corporation for federal income tax purpose based on the rule for determining share ownership under section of the code medtronic inc shareholder received approximately of our ordinary share by both vote and value by reason of holding stock in medtronic inc therefore under current law we should not be treated corporation for federal income tax purpose however there is limited guidance regarding the application of section including the application of the ownership test if we were to be treated corporation for federal tax purpose we could be subject to substantially greater tax liability than currently contemplated non corporation legislative or other governmental action relating to the denial of federal or state governmental contract to company that redomicile abroad could adversely affect our business various federal and state legislative proposal that would deny governmental contract to company that move their corporate location abroad may affect we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of the regulation that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactment or the effect such enactment and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business risk relating to our jurisdiction of incorporationwe are incorporated in ireland and irish law differs from the law in effect in the and may afford le protection to holder of our security our shareholder may have more difficulty protecting their interest than would shareholder of corporation incorporated in jurisdiction of the united state it may not be possible to enforce court judgment obtained in the against in ireland based on the civil liability provision of the federal or state security law in addition there is some uncertainty to whether the court of ireland would recognize or enforce judgment of court obtained against or our director or officer based on the civil liability provision of the federal or state security law or hear action against or those person based on those law we have been advised that the currently doe not have treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgment in civil and commercial matter therefore final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on federal or state security law would not automatically be enforceable in ireland an irish company we are governed by the irish company act which differs in some material respect from law generally applicable to corporation and shareholder including among others difference relating to interested director and officer transaction and shareholder lawsuit likewise the duty of director and officer of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholder of irish company generally do not have personal right of action against director or officer of the company and may exercise such right of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstance accordingly holder of our security may have more difficulty protecting their interest than would holder of security of corporation incorporated in the an irish public limited company certain capital structure decision require shareholder approval which may limit medtronic flexibility to manage it capital structure under irish law our authorized share capital can be increased by an ordinary

shareholder where share are being issued for cash consideration but allows shareholder to disapply such statutory preemption right either in our article of association or by way of special resolution such disapplication can either be generally applicable or be in respect of particular allotment of share accordingly our article of association contain permitted by irish company law provision authorizing the board to issue new share and to disapply statutory preemption right the authorization of the director to issue share and the disapplication of statutory preemption right must both be renewed by the shareholder at least every five year and we can not provide any assurance that these authorization will always be approved which could limit our ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect the holder of our security transfer of our share other than one effected by mean of the transfer of book entry interest in the depository trust company may be subject to irish stamp duty transfer of our share effected by mean of the transfer of book entry interest in the depository trust company dtc will not be subject to irish stamp duty however if shareholder hold our share
