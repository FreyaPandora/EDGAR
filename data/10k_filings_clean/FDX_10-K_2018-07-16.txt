country operation revenue revenue increased in due to improved performance at all of our transportation segment revenue at fedex express increased in due to improved base yield and favorable exchange rate despite impact from the notpetya cyberattack discussed above at fedex ground revenue increased in due to volume growth and increased yield fedex freight revenue increased in due to higher revenue per shipment and average daily shipment higher fuel surcharge had positive impact on revenue at all of our transportation segment in revenue increased in due to the inclusion of tnt express and improvement at our other transportation segment at fedex ground revenue increased in due to improved yield and volume growth revenue at fedex express increased in primarily due to the inclusion of tnt express revenue in were negatively impacted by one fewer operating day at fedex express and fedex ground fedex freight revenue increased due to higher average daily shipment and higher revenue per

million in expense related to the settlement of cbp notice of action involving fedex trade network in each case net of recognized immaterial insurance recovery our operating income and margin declined primarily due to the notpetya cyberattack at tnt express fourth quarter goodwill and other asset impairment charge and increased tnt express integration expense salary and employee benefit expense increased in due to merit increase at all of our transportation segment unfavorable exchange rate at fedex express and higher staffing at fedex ground and fedex freight purchased transportation cost increased in due to higher volume at all of our transportation segment increased transportation rate and higher fuel expense at fedex ground and unfavorable exchange rate at fedex express other operating expense increased in primarily due to increased outside service contract and unfavorable exchange rate at fedex express and higher tnt express integration expense in our operating income and margin benefited from the slight positive impact of our mtm retirement plan adjustment compared to large mtm loss in the prior year the year over year decrease in associated with the independent contractor litigation matter and cbp matter and the continued growth and cost management initiative at the fedex express segment however operating margin wa negatively impacted in by the inclusion of tnt express tnt express integration expense and network expansion cost at fedex ground in purchased transportation cost increased due to the inclusion of tnt express and higher volume and increased transportation rate at fedex ground salary and employee benefit expense increased in due to the inclusion of tnt express volume growth and staffing to support network expansion at fedex ground merit increase at fedex express and higher staffing level to support volume growth and merit increase at fedex freight other expense increased in primarily due to outside service contract at tnt express and the reserve for the legal matter involving fedex trade network and fedex ground which were offset by the inclusion of independent contractor litigation expense and the cbp matter in the prior year fuel the following graph for our transportation segment show our average cost of jet and vehicle fuel per gallon for the year ended may fuel expense increased during due to higher fuel price however fuel price represent only one component of the two factor we consider meaningful in understanding the impact of fuel on our business consideration must also be given to the fuel surcharge revenue we collect accordingly we believe discussion of the net impact of fuel on our result which is comparison of the year over year change in these two factor is important to understand the impact of fuel on our business in order to provide information about the impact of fuel surcharge on the trend in revenue and yield growth we have included the comparative weighted average fuel surcharge percentage in effect for and in the accompanying discussion of each of our transportation segment our fuel surcharge are adjusted on weekly basis the fuel surcharge is based on weekly fuel price from two week prior to the week in which it is assessed some fedex express international fuel surcharge incorporate timing lag of approximately six to eight week prior to february our fuel surcharge for the fedex express and fedex ground business incorporated timing lag of approximately six to eight week before they were adjusted for change in fuel price for example the fuel surcharge index in effect at fedex express in january wa set based on november fuel price beyond these factor the manner in which we purchase fuel also influence the net impact of fuel on our result for example our contract for jet fuel purchase at fedex express are tied to various index including the gulf coast index while many of these index are aligned each index may fluctuate at different pace driving variability in the price paid for jet fuel furthermore under these contractual arrangement approximately of our jet fuel is purchased based on the index price for the preceding week with the remainder of our purchase tied to the index price for the preceding month rather than based on daily spot rate these contractual provision mitigate the impact of rapidly changing daily spot rate on our jet fuel purchase because of the factor described above our operating result may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by significant amount or change by amount that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharge which can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short term for more information see risk factor below the net impact of fuel had significant benefit to operating income in higher fuel surcharge more than offset increased fuel price the net impact of fuel on our operating result doe not consider the effect that fuel surcharge level may have on our business including change in demand and shift in the mix of service purchased by our customer while fluctuation in fuel surcharge percentage can be significant from period to period fuel surcharge represent one of the many individual component of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield additional component include the mix of service sold the base price and extra service charge we obtain for these service and the level of pricing discount offered fuel expense increased during due to the inclusion of tnt express and higher fuel price the net impact of fuel had minimal impact on operating income in higher fuel surcharge were more than offset by increased fuel price other income and expense interest expense increased million in primarily due to debt and commercial paper issuance during the year interest expense increased million in primarily due to our and euro debt issuance in which wa partially offset by gain of million from the sale of an investment during income tax our effective tax rate wa in in and in our tax rate wa favorably impacted by the enactment of the tcja during the third quarter of may we are still completing our accounting for the income tax effect of the tcja in accordance with staff accounting bulletin issued by the staff of the security and exchange commission sec we have recorded provisional benefit of billion related to the

benefit of million from corporate structuring transaction part of the ongoing integration of fedex express and tnt express and benefit of million from foreign tax credit generated by distribution to

continue to execute operational improvement program at fedex ground and fedex freight that are designed to increase operational efficiency and safety enhance service offering to our customer and reduce our cost structure our expectation for earnings growth in are dependent on key external factor including fuel price moderate economic growth and stability in global trade during we also will

annually interest on our euro fixed rate note is paid annually our floating rate euro senior note bear interest at three month euribor plus spread of basis point and reset quarterly we used the net proceeds of our debt issuance for voluntary incremental contribution in february to our pension plan we utilized the net proceeds of our debt issuance for voluntary incremental contribution in january

share amount total number of share purchased average price paid per share total purchase price total number of share purchased average price paid per share total purchase price common stock repurchase on january our board of director approved share repurchase program of up to million share share under this repurchase program may be repurchased from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transaction the timing and volume of repurchase are at the discretion of management based on the capital need of the business the market price of fedex common stock and general market condition no time limit wa set for the completion of the program and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time see additional information on the share repurchase program in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement of may million share remained under the current share repurchase authorization capital resource our operation are capital intensive characterized by significant investment in aircraft vehicle technology facility and package handling and sort equipment the amount and timing of capital addition depend on various factor including pre existing contractual commitment anticipated volume growth domestic and international economic condition new or enhanced service geographical expansion of service availability of satisfactory financing and action of regulatory authority the following table compare capital expenditure by asset category and reportable segment for the year ended may in million percent change aircraft and related equipment package handling and ground support equipment vehicle information technology facility and other total capital expenditure fedex express segment fedex ground segment fedex freight segment fedex service segment other total capital expenditure capital expenditure during were higher than the prior year primarily due to increased spending at fedex express for aircraft and related equipment aircraft and related equipment purchase at fedex express during included the delivery of boeing freighter aircraft and four boeing freighter aircraft offset by lower spending related to package handling and ground support equipment at fedex ground capital expenditure during were higher than the prior year primarily due to the inclusion of tnt express and increased spending at fedex express for aircraft and related equipment partially offset by the deferral of certain fedex ground network expansion project to aircraft and related equipment purchase at fedex express during included the delivery of aircraft well increased spending on existing order for aircraft offset by decreased spending related to the modification of certain aircraft before being placed into service liquidity outlook we believe that our cash and cash equivalent which totaled billion at may cash flow from operation and available financing source will be adequate to meet our liquidity need including working capital capital expenditure requirement debt payment obligation pension contribution and tnt express integration expense our cash and cash equivalent balance at may includes billion of cash in foreign jurisdiction associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy we are able to access the majority of this cash without material tax cost the enactment of the tcja significantly reduced the cost of repatriating foreign earnings from tax perspective we do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these fund impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligation our capital expenditure are expected to be approximately billion in we anticipate that our cash flow from operation will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditure in which will include spending for aircraft modernization at fedex express spending on facility and sort equipment at fedex ground and spending for tnt express integration related investment we expect approximately of capital expenditure in to be designated for growth initiative our expected capital expenditure for include billion for delivery of aircraft and progress payment toward future aircraft delivery at fedex express in addition over multiple year we will be investing over billion to significantly expand the fedex express indianapolis hub and over billion to modernize the fedex express memphis world hub capital expenditure at fedex ground are expected to decline in due to the completion of two major hub project that boost our capacity in the northeast we have several aircraft modernization program underway that are supported by the purchase of and aircraft these aircraft are significantly more fuel efficient per unit than the aircraft type previously utilized and these expenditure are necessary to achieve significant long term operating saving and to replace older aircraft our ability to delay the timing of these aircraft related expenditure is limited without incurring significant cost to modify existing purchase agreement during fedex express entered into an agreement to purchase cessna skycourier aircraft with option to purchase up to additional cessna skycourier aircraft the firm order cessna skycourier aircraft are expected to be delivered from through fedex express also entered into an agreement to purchase atr aircraft with option to purchase up to additional atr aircraft the firm order atr aircraft are expected to be delivered from through additionally fedex express entered into an agreement to accelerate the delivery of two aircraft from to one aircraft from to and one aircraft from to on june fedex express entered into agreement to purchase incremental aircraft and incremental aircraft six of the and one of the aircraft purchase are conditioned upon there being no event that cause fedex express or it employee not to be covered by the railway labor act of amended rla the aircraft are expected to be delivered between and the aircraft are expected to be delivered between and part of these agreement one and one aircraft delivery were accelerated from to fedex express now ha total of firm order for aircraft scheduled for delivery during through one of which wa delivered in june and total of firm order for aircraft for delivery during through two of which were delivered in june six of the order and five of the order are conditioned upon there being no event that cause fedex express or it employee not to be covered by the rla the rla condition wa removed from three previously ordered aircraft fedex express also acquired option to purchase an additional aircraft and the delivery date of existing option aircraft were rescheduled result fedex express now ha option to purchase total of aircraft for delivery through fedex express also acquired option to purchase an additional six aircraft result fedex express now ha option to purchase total of aircraft for delivery through in fedex express entered into agreement to accelerate the delivery of two aircraft to from and two aircraft to from we have shelf registration statement filed with the sec that allows to sell in one or more future offering any combination of our unsecured debt security and common stock during we amended our five year revolving credit facility to increase the aggregate amount available under the facility from billion to billion the facility which expires in november and includes million letter of credit sublimit is available to finance our operation and other cash flow need the agreement contains financial covenant which requires to maintain ratio of debt to consolidated earnings excluding non cash retirement plan mtm adjustment and non cash asset impairment charge before interest tax depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda of not more than to calculated of the end of the applicable quarter on rolling four quarter basis the ratio of our debt to adjusted ebitda wa to at may we believe this covenant is the only significant restrictive covenant in our revolving credit agreement our revolving credit agreement contains other customary covenant that do not individually or in the aggregate materially restrict the conduct of our business we are in compliance with the financial covenant and all other covenant of our revolving credit agreement and do not expect the covenant to affect our operation including our liquidity or expected funding need if we failed to comply with the financial covenant or any other covenant of our revolving credit agreement our access to financing could become limited we do not expect to be at risk of noncompliance with the financial covenant or any other covenant of our revolving credit agreement of may no commercial paper wa outstanding however we had total of million in letter of credit outstanding at may with million of the letter of credit sublimit unused under our revolving credit facility for we anticipate making voluntary contribution to our pension plan although at much lower level than in or noted in our discussion of critical accounting estimate we do not anticipate contribution to our pension plan will be required for the foreseeable future based on our funded status and the fact we have credit balance related to our cumulative excess voluntary pension contribution over those required that exceeds billion the credit balance is subtracted from plan asset to determine the minimum funding requirement therefore we could eliminate all required contribution to our principal pension plan for several year if we were to choose to waive part of that credit balance in any given year our pension plan have ample fund to meet expected benefit payment on june our board of director declared quarterly dividend of per share of common stock an increase of per share from the prior quarter dividend the dividend wa paid on july to stockholder of record of the close of business on june each quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our board of director and we evaluate our dividend payment amount on an annual basis at the end of each fiscal year standard poor ha assigned senior unsecured debt credit rating of bbb commercial paper rating of and rating outlook of stable moody investor service ha assigned an unsecured debt credit rating of commercial paper rating of and rating outlook of stable if our credit rating drop our interest expense may increase if our commercial paper rating drop below current level we may have difficulty utilizing the commercial paper market if our senior unsecured debt credit rating drop below investment grade our access to financing may become limited contractual cash obligation and off balance sheet arrangement the following table set forth summary of our contractual cash obligation of may certain of these contractual obligation are reflected in our balance sheet while others are disclosed future obligation under accounting principle generally accepted in the united state except for the current portion of interest on long term debt this table doe not include amount already recorded in our balance sheet current liability at may we have certain contingent liability that are not accrued in our balance sheet in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state these contingent liability are not included in the table below we have other long term liability reflected in our balance sheet including deferred income tax qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement healthcare plan liability and other self insurance accrual unless statutorily required the payment obligation associated with these liability are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturity accordingly this table is not meant to represent forecast of our total cash expenditure for any of the period presented payment due by fiscal year undiscounted in million thereafter total operating activity operating lease non capital purchase obligation and other interest on long term debt investing activity aircraft and aircraft related capital commitment other capital purchase obligation financing activity debt total open purchase order that are cancelable are not considered unconditional purchase obligation for financial reporting purpose and are not included in the table above such purchase order often represent authorization to purchase rather than binding agreement see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement for more information on such purchase order operating activity in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state future contractual payment under our operating lease totaling billion on an undiscounted basis are not recorded in our balance sheet credit rating agency routinely use information concerning minimum lease payment required for our operating lease to calculate our debt capacity the amount reflected in the table above for operating lease represent undiscounted future minimum lease payment under noncancelable operating lease principally facility and aircraft with an initial or remaining term in excess of one year at may under the new lease accounting rule the majority of these lease will be required to be recognized at the net present value on the balance sheet liability with an offsetting right to use asset effective in the amount reflected for purchase obligation represent noncancelable agreement to purchase good or service that are not capital related such contract include those for printing and advertising and promotion contract included in the table above within the caption entitled non capital purchase obligation and other is our estimate of the current portion of the liability million for uncertain tax position we can not reasonably estimate the timing of the long term payment or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time therefore the long term portion of the liability million is excluded from the table see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement for further information of may we had billion in deposit and progress payment on aircraft purchase and other planned aircraft related transaction investing activity the amount reflected in the table above for capital purchase obligation represent noncancelable agreement to purchase capital related equipment such contract include those for certain purchase of aircraft aircraft modification vehicle facility computer and other equipment financing activity we have certain financial instrument representing potential commitment not reflected in the table above that were incurred in the normal course of business to support our operation including standby letter of credit and surety bond these instrument are required under certain self insurance program and are also used in the normal course of international operation the underlying liability insured by these instrument are reflected in our balance sheet where applicable therefore no additional liability is reflected for the letter of credit and surety bond the amount reflected in the table above for long term debt represent future scheduled payment on our long term debt critical accounting estimate the preparation of financial statement in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state requires management to make significant judgment and estimate to develop amount reflected and disclosed in the financial statement in many case there are alternative policy or estimation technique that could be used we maintain thorough process to review the application of our accounting policy and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimate that are required to prepare the financial statement of complex global corporation however even under optimal circumstance estimate routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstance and new or better information the estimate discussed below include the financial statement element that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policy and are material to our financial statement management ha discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of director and with our independent registered public accounting firm retirement plan overview we sponsor program that provide retirement benefit to most of our employee these program include defined benefit pension plan defined contribution plan and postretirement healthcare plan and are described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement the rule for pension accounting are complex and can produce volatility in our earnings financial condition and liquidity we are required to record annual year end adjustment to our financial statement for the net funded status of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan the funded status of our plan also impact our liquidity however the cash funding rule operate under completely different set of assumption and standard than those used for financial reporting purpose result our actual cash funding requirement can differ materially from our reported funded status over the past several year we have taken numerous action to reduce pension related risk and expense including the introduction of our portable pension account benefit freezing our traditional pension benefit employing liability driven investment strategy and permitting former employee with traditional pension benefit to make one time irrevocable election to receive their benefit in lump sum distribution continuation of this strategy we entered into an agreement with metropolitan life insurance company in may to purchase group annuity contract and transfer approximately billion of our pension plan obligation the transaction transferred responsibility for pension benefit to metropolitan life insurance company for approximately of our retiree and beneficiary who satisfy certain condition and currently receive monthly benefit from participating pension plan there wa no change to the pension benefit for any plan participant result of this transaction the purchase of the group annuity contract wa funded directly by asset of the pension plan the group annuity contract reduced the size of our pension plan significantly reduced our exposure to market risk and associated balance sheet volatility and eliminated the investment administrative and pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc premium expense for approximately retiree we recognized million one time settlement loss in connection with this transaction which is included in our year end mtm retirement plan adjustment the salary and employee benefit caption of our consolidated income statement includes expense associated with service prior service and interest cost the expected return on asset eroa and settlement our fourth quarter mtm adjustment is included in the retirement plan mark to market adjustment caption in our consolidated income statement summary of our retirement plan cost over the past three year is follows in million total defined benefit pension plan defined contribution plan postretirement healthcare plan retirement plan mark to market gain loss the pre tax component of the mtm adjustment are follows in million discount rate change demographic assumption experience annuity contract purchase actual versus expected return on asset total mark to market gain loss the weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan increased from at may to at may the demographic assumption experience in reflects liability loss due to unfavorable result related to various demographic assumption the annuity contract purchase loss relates to the contract with metropolitan life insurance company discussed above the actual rate of return which is net of all fee and expense on our pension plan asset of wa slightly lower than our expected return of primarily due to generally flat return in the long duration fixed income portfolio partially offset by strong return from global equity the actual rate of return on our pension plan asset of net of all fee and expense wa higher than our expected return of primarily due to rise in the value of global equity market and favorable credit market condition the weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan decreased from at may to at may the demographic assumption experience in reflects an update in mortality table for pension and other postemployment benefit plan the actual rate of return on our pension plan asset of net of all fee and expense wa lower than our expected return of primarily due to challenging environment for global equity and other risk seeking asset class the weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan declined from at may to at may the demographic assumption experience in reflects change in disability rate and an increase in the average retirement age for pension and other postemployment benefit plan discount rate this is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payment that have been accrued to date the projected benefit obligation or pbo to their net present value and to determine the succeeding year ongoing pension expense prior to any year end mtm adjustment the discount rate is determined each year at the plan measurement date the discount rate for our pension plan at each measurement date wa follows measurement date discount rate we determine the discount rate with the assistance of actuary who calculate the yield on theoretical portfolio of high grade corporate bond rated aa or better in developing this theoretical portfolio we select bond that match cash flow to benefit payment limit our concentration by industry and issuer and apply screening criterion to ensure bond with call feature have low probability of being called to the extent scheduled bond proceeds exceed the estimated benefit payment in given period the calculation assumes those excess proceeds are reinvested at one year forward rate the measurement of our pbo and the related impact on our annual mtm adjustment is highly sensitive to the discount rate assumption for our largest pension plan basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased our pbo by approximately billion and basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased our pbo by approximately billion however our annual segment level pension expense is le sensitive to change in the discount rate for example one basis point increase in the discount rate for our largest pension plan would have million effect on the fourth quarter mtm adjustment but only net impact on segment level pension expense plan asset the expected average rate of return on plan asset is long term forward looking assumption that affect our segment level pension expense it is required to be the expected future long term rate of earnings on plan asset our pension plan asset are invested primarily in publicly tradable security and our pension plan hold only minimal investment in fedex common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third party pension fund investment manager part of our strategy to manage pension cost and funded status volatility we follow liability driven investment strategy to better align plan asset with liability establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension asset is judgmental matter which we review on an annual basis and revise appropriate management considers the following factor in determining this assumption the duration of our pension plan liability which drive the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan asset the type of investment class in which we invest our pension plan asset and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment class to earn over time net of all fee and expense and the investment return we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the return we could expect if investment were made strictly in indexed fund for consolidated pension expense we assumed expected long term rate of return on our pension plan asset in and for we have increased our eroa assumption to the decrease in the number of retiree in payment status due to the purchase of group annuity contract in may discussed above will reduce our short term cash outlay and allow the remaining asset to be placed in longer duration investment which will increase the rate of return on asset also the reduction of pbgc fixed and variable rate premium will increase the net return on asset the actuarial historical annual return on our pension plan asset calculated on compound geometric basis wa net of all fee and expense for the year period ended may for our pension plan one basis point change in our eroa would impact our pension expense by million funded status the following is information concerning the funded status of our pension plan of may on financial reporting basis in million funded status of plan projected benefit obligation pbo fair value of plan asset funded status of the plan cash amount cash contribution during the year benefit payment during the year funding the funding requirement for our pension plan are governed by the pension protection act of which ha aggressive funding requirement in order to avoid benefit payment restriction that become effective if the funded status determined under internal revenue service rule fall below at the beginning of plan year all of our pension plan have funded status level in excess of and our plan are fully funded under the employee retirement income security act additionally current benefit payment do not materially impact our total plan asset benefit payment for our pension plan for were approximately billion or of plan asset measured before the annuity purchase benefit payment were higher in because our pension plan were amended to permit former employee with vested traditional pension benefit to make one time irrevocable election to receive their benefit in lump sum distribution approximately former employee elected to receive this lump sum distribution and total of approximately billion wa paid in may over the past several year we have made voluntary contribution to our pension plan in excess of the minimum required contribution for no pension contribution will be required for our pension plan they are fully funded however we expect to make tax deductible discretionary contribution to those plan at level significantly le than in in addition to required contribution to certain international pension plan we expect total pension plan contribution to be substantially le than those made in see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement for further information about our retirement plan income tax given the growth in our international business and the complexity and change resulting from the enactment of the tcja we have added income tax critical accounting estimate for we are subject to income tax in the and numerous foreign jurisdiction our income tax are function of our income statutory tax rate and tax planning opportunity available to in the various jurisdiction in which we operate further the acquisition of tnt express the largest acquisition in our history ha expanded our foreign operation significantly and increased the complexity of our global operation from an income tax perspective the tax law in the various jurisdiction are complex and subject to different interpretation by and the respective governmental taxing authority result significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax position including evaluating uncertainty also our effective tax rate is significantly affected by the earnings generated in each jurisdiction so unexpected fluctuation in the geographic mix of earnings could significantly impact our tax rate our intercompany transaction are based on globally accepted transfer pricing principle which align profit with the business operation and function of the various legal entity in our international business we evaluate our tax position quarterly and adjust the balance new information becomes available these evaluation are based on factor including but not limited to change in fact or circumstance change in tax law or their interpretation audit activity and change in our business in addition management considers the advice of third party in making conclusion regarding tax consequence tax contingency arise from uncertainty in the application of tax rule throughout the many jurisdiction in which we operate despite our belief that our tax return position are consistent with applicable tax law taxing authority could challenge certain position we record tax benefit for uncertain tax position based upon management evaluation of the information available at the reporting date to be recognized in the financial statement tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merit the benefit for position meeting the recognition threshold is measured the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with taxing authority that ha full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required in making these determination and adjustment to unrecognized tax benefit may be necessary to reflect actual tax payable upon settlement deferred income tax asset represent amount available to reduce income tax payable on taxable income in future year such asset arise because of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability well from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deduction and credit by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategy these source of income rely heavily on estimate to make this determination so there is risk that these estimate will have to be revised new information is received to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that deferred tax asset will be recovered valuation allowance is established we believe we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefit related to the remaining net deferred tax asset in our consolidated balance sheet that are not subject to valuation allowance our income tax position are based on currently enacted tax law on december the united state government enacted comprehensive tax legislation through the tcja which significantly change the corporate income tax system and includes among other thing permanent reduction in the corporate income tax rate from to one time transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings and new tax on certain foreign source earnings and certain related party payment which are referred to the global intangible low taxed income tax and the base erosion and anti abuse tax the tcja requires complex computation to be performed that were not previously required in tax law significant judgment estimate and calculation to be made in interpreting it provision and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the treasury department the internal revenue service and other standard setting body could interpret or issue guidance on how provision of the tcja will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation in addition further legislative action could be taken to address question or issue caused by the tcja we continue our ongoing analysis of the tcja and it related interpretation collect and prepare necessary data and interpret any additional guidance we may make adjustment to amount that we have recorded that may materially impact our result of operation and financial condition additionally state and foreign government may enact tax law in response to the tcja or other global initiative that could result in further change to our taxation and adversely impact our result of operation and financial condition for more information including impact from the tcja see the income tax section of this md and note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement self insurance accrual we are self insured up to certain limit for cost associated with worker compensation claim vehicle accident and general business liability and benefit paid under employee healthcare and disability program our reserve are established for estimate of loss on reported claim including incurred but not reported claim self insurance accrual reflected in our balance sheet were billion at may and billion at may approximately of these accrual were classified current liability our self insurance accrual are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claim incurred of the balance sheet date these estimate include consideration of factor such severity of claim frequency and volume of claim healthcare inflation seasonality and plan design cost trend on material accrual are updated each quarter we self insure up to certain limit that vary by type of risk periodically we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance level based on risk tolerance and premium expense where estimable loss covered by insurance are recognized on gross basis with corresponding insurance receivable we believe the use of actuarial method to account for these liability provides consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accrual however the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claim involved and the length of time the ultimate cost is known we believe our recorded obligation for these expense are consistently measured on conservative basis nevertheless change in healthcare cost accident frequency and severity insurance retention level and other factor can materially affect the estimate for these liability long lived asset useful life and salvage value our business is capital intensive with approximately of our total asset invested in our transportation and information system infrastructure the depreciation or amortization of our capital asset over their estimated useful life and the determination of any salvage value requires management to make judgment about future event because we utilize many of our capital asset over relatively long period the majority of aircraft cost are depreciated over to year we periodically evaluate whether adjustment to our estimated service life or salvage value are necessary to ensure these estimate properly match the economic use of the asset this evaluation may result in change in the estimated life and residual value used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment for our aircraft we typically assign no residual value due to the utilization of these asset in cargo configuration which result in little to no value at the end of their useful life these estimate affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in period and ultimately the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset change in the estimated life of asset will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future period and could have material impact on our result of operation described below historically gain and loss on disposal of operating equipment have not been material however such amount may differ materially in the future due to change in business level technological obsolescence accident frequency regulatory change and other factor beyond our control impairment of may the fedex express global air and ground network included fleet of aircraft including approximately supplemental aircraft that provide delivery of package and freight to more than country and territory through wide range of and international shipping service while certain aircraft are utilized in primary geographic area versus international we operate an integrated global network and utilize our aircraft and other mode of transportation to achieve the lowest cost of delivery while maintaining our service commitment to our customer because of the integrated nature of our global network our aircraft are interchangeable across route and geography giving flexibility with our fleet planning to meet changing global economic condition and maintain and modify aircraft needed because of the lengthy lead time for aircraft manufacture and modification we must anticipate volume level and plan our fleet requirement year in advance and make commitment for aircraft based on those projection furthermore the timing and availability of certain used aircraft type particularly those with better fuel efficiency may create limited opportunity to acquire these aircraft at favorable price in advance of our capacity need these activity create risk that asset capacity may exceed demand at may we had one purchased aircraft that wa not yet placed into service the accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with it estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the cash flow do not exceed the carrying value the asset must be adjusted to it current fair value we operate integrated transportation network and accordingly cash flow for most of our operating asset are assessed at network level not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment further decision about capital investment are evaluated based on the impact to the overall network rather than the return on an individual asset we make decision to remove certain long lived asset from service based on projection of reduced capacity need or lower operating cost of newer aircraft type and those decision may result in an impairment charge asset held for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair value le cost to sell when the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criterion are met the fair value determination for such aircraft may require management estimate there may not be active market for some of these aircraft such estimate are subject to revision from period to period in the normal management of our aircraft fleet we routinely idle aircraft and engine temporarily due to maintenance cycle and adjustment of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand level temporarily idled asset are classified available for use and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these asset these temporarily idled asset are assessed for impairment on quarterly basis the criterion for determining whether an asset ha been permanently removed from service and result is potentially impaired include but are not limited to our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume level including capacity need during our peak shipping season the introduction of new fleet type or decision to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operation and change to planned service expansion activity at may we had five aircraft temporarily idled these aircraft have been idled for an average of month and are expected to return to revenue service in order to meet expected demand sale on april we sold non core business of tnt express and recorded gain of million in the fedex express segment lease we utilize operating lease to finance certain of our aircraft facility and equipment such arrangement typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the asset at the end of the lease period to the lessor disclosed in financial condition contractual cash obligation and off balance sheet arrangement and note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement at may we had approximately billion on an undiscounted basis of future commitment for payment under operating lease the weighted average remaining lease term of all operating lease outstanding at may wa approximately six year the future commitment for operating lease are not yet reflected liability in our balance sheet until the new rule on lease accounting issued in become effective in described below the determination of whether lease is accounted for capital lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimate primarily about the fair value of the asset and it estimated economic useful life in addition our evaluation includes ensuring we properly account for build to suit lease arrangement and making judgment about whether various form of lessee involvement during the construction period make the lessee an agent for the owner lessor or in substance the owner of the asset during the construction period we believe we have well defined and controlled process for making these evaluation including obtaining third party appraisal for material transaction to assist in making these evaluation on february the financial accounting standard board fasb issued new lease accounting standard based on the new lease accounting standard and our lease portfolio we currently anticipate recognizing lease liability and related right of use asset on the balance sheet in excess of billion with an immaterial impact on our income statement compared to the current lease accounting model however the ultimate impact of the standard will depend on the company lease portfolio of the adoption date the new standard will be effective for on june fiscal see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement for more information on this recent accounting guidance goodwill of may we had billion of recorded goodwill from our business acquisition representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net asset we have acquired during we recorded million in additional goodwill associated with the completion of the purchase price allocation related to the tnt express acquisition during we recorded billion in goodwill associated with our tnt express acquisition several factor give rise to goodwill in our acquisition such the expected benefit from synergy of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment in our evaluation of goodwill impairment we perform qualitative assessment that requires management judgment and the use of estimate to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive we proceed to two step process to test goodwill for impairment including comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying value including attributable goodwill fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodology principally the income or market approach incorporating market participant consideration and management assumption on revenue growth rate operating margin discount rate and expected capital expenditure estimate used by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test change in forecasted operating result and other assumption could materially affect these estimate we perform our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter unless circumstance indicate the need to accelerate the timing of the test in connection with our annual impairment testing of goodwill conducted in the fourth quarter of we recorded an impairment charge of million for substantially all of the goodwill attributable to our fedex supply chain reporting unit the key factor contributing to the goodwill impairment were underperformance of the fedex supply chain business during including base business erosion and the failure to attain the level of operating synergy and revenue and profit growth anticipated at the time of acquisition based on these factor our outlook for the business and industry changed in the fourth quarter of our other reporting unit with significant recorded goodwill include fedex express fedex ground fedex freight and fedex office reported in the fedex service segment we evaluated these reporting unit during the fourth quarter of and the estimated fair value of each of these reporting unit exceeded their carrying value in and therefore we do not believe that any of these reporting unit were impaired of the balance sheet date in january the fasb issued an accounting standard update that simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill eliminating step from the goodwill impairment test we adopted the guidance during the fourth quarter of see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement for more information on this recent accounting guidance legal and other contingency we are subject to various loss contingency in connection with our operation contingent liability are difficult to measure their measurement is subject to multiple factor that are not easily predicted or projected further additional complexity in measuring these liability arises due to the various jurisdiction in which these matter occur which make our ability to predict their outcome highly uncertain moreover different accounting rule must be employed to account for these item based on the nature of the contingency accordingly significant management judgment is required to ass these matter and to make determination about the measurement of liability if any our material pending loss contingency are described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement in the opinion of management the aggregate liability if any of individual matter or group of related matter not specifically described in note is not expected to be material to our financial position result of operation or cash flow the following describes our method and associated process for evaluating these matter because of the complex environment in which we operate we are subject to other legal proceeding and claim including those relating to general commercial matter governmental enforcement action employment related claim and fedex ground owner operator accounting guidance for contingency requires an accrual of estimated loss from contingency such non income tax or other legal proceeding or claim when it is probable the future event or event are likely to occur that loss ha been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated this guidance also requires disclosure of loss contingency matter when in management judgment material loss is reasonably possible or probable during the preparation of our financial statement we evaluate our contingency to determine whether it is probable reasonably possible or remote that liability ha been incurred loss is recognized for all contingency deemed probable and estimable regardless of amount for unresolved contingency with potentially material exposure that are deemed reasonably possible we evaluate whether potential loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated our evaluation of these matter is the result of comprehensive process designed to ensure that accounting recognition of loss or disclosure of these contingency is made in timely manner and involves our legal and accounting personnel well external counsel where applicable the process includes regular communication during each quarter and scheduled meeting shortly before the completion of our financial statement to evaluate any new legal proceeding and the status of existing matter in determining whether loss should be accrued or loss contingency disclosed we evaluate among other factor the current status of each matter within the scope and context of the entire lawsuit or proceeding the lengthy and complex nature of class action matter the procedural status of each matter any opportunity to dispose of lawsuit on it merit before trial motion to dismiss or for summary judgment the amount of time remaining before trial date the status of discovery the status of settlement arbitration or mediation proceeding and our judgment regarding the likelihood of success prior to or at trial in reaching our conclusion with respect to accrual of loss or loss contingency disclosure we take holistic view of each matter based on these factor and the information available prior to the issuance of our financial statement uncertainty with respect to an individual factor or combination of these factor may impact our decision related to accrual or disclosure of loss contingency including conclusion that we are unable to establish an estimate of possible loss or meaningful range of possible loss we update our disclosure to reflect our most current understanding of the contingency at the time we issue our financial statement however event may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of contingency may result in loss to that differs materially from our previously estimated liability or range of possible loss despite the inherent complexity in the accounting and disclosure of contingency we believe that our process are robust and thorough and provide consistent framework for management in evaluating the potential outcome of contingency for proper accounting recognition and disclosure risk factor our financial and operating result are subject to many risk and uncertainty described below we are directly affected by the state of the economy and anti trade measure while macroeconomic risk apply to most company we are particularly vulnerable the transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trend in economic activity our primary business is to transport good so our business level are directly tied to the purchase and production of good key macroeconomic measurement when individual and company purchase and produce fewer good we transport fewer good and company expand the number of distribution center and move manufacturing closer to consumer market we transport good shorter distance in addition we have relatively high fixed cost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume level moreover we continue to grow our international business we are increasingly affected by the health of the global economy the rate of growth of global trade world trade policy international tax government to government relation and the typically more volatile economy of emerging market for instance anti trade and protectionist measure adopted by the or other country in which we do business such trade control tariff quota embargo sanction or retaliation by another country against such measure could result in economic uncertainty and instability resulting in fewer good being transported globally significant data breach or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could disrupt our operation and result in the loss of critical confidential information adversely impacting our reputation business or result of operation our ability to attract and retain customer to efficiently operate our business and to compete effectively depends in part upon the sophistication and reliability of our technology network including our ability to provide feature of service that are important to our customer to protect our confidential business information and the information provided by our customer and to maintain customer confidence in our ability to protect our system and to provide service consistent with their expectation for example we rely on information technology to receive package level information in advance of physical receipt of package to track item that move through our delivery system to efficiently plan delivery to execute billing process and to track and report financial and operational data we are subject to risk imposed by data breach and operational disruption including through cyberattack or cyber intrusion including by computer hacker foreign government cyber terrorist cyber criminal and malicious employee or other insider data breach of company and government have increased in recent year the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attack and intrusion from around the world have increased additionally risk such code anomaly act of god transitional challenge in migrating operating company functionality to our fedex enterprise automation platform data leakage and human error pose direct threat to our product service and data and could result in unauthorized or block legitimate access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operation customer employee and supplier including personal information we also depend on and interact with the technology and system of third party including our customer and third party service provider such cloud service provider and delivery service for variety of reason such third party may have access to information we maintain about our company customer employee and vendor or operate system that are critical to our business operation and service like these third party are subject to risk imposed by data breach cyberattacks and other event or action that could damage disrupt or close down their network or system we have security process protocol and standard in place including contractual provision requiring such security measure that are applicable to such third party and are designed to protect information that is held by them or to which they have access result of their engagement with nevertheless cyberattack could defeat one or more of such third party security measure allowing an attacker to obtain information about our company customer employee and vendor or disrupt our operation these third party may also experience operational disruption or human error that could result in unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operation customer employee and supplier including personal information any disruption to our complex global technology infrastructure including those impacting our computer system and website could result in the loss of confidential business or customer information adversely impact our operation customer service volume and revenue could lead to litigation or investigation or require substantial repair or replacement resulting in significant cost additionally security breach could require to devote significant management resource to address the problem created these type of adverse impact could also occur in the event the confidentiality integrity or availability of company and customer information wa compromised due to data loss by fedex or trusted third party we or the third party with which we share information may not discover any security breach and loss of information for significant period of time after the security breach occurs recently there ha also been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the at both the state and federal level and abroad and an actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable or foreign data protection regulation or other data protection standard may expose to litigation fine sanction or other penalty which could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business result of operation and financial condition this regulatory environment is increasingly challenging and may present material obligation and risk to our business including significantly expanded compliance burden cost and enforcement risk for example the european union eu general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective in may greatly increase the jurisdictional reach of eu law and add broad array of requirement related to personal data including individual notice and opt out preference and the public disclosure of significant data breach additionally violation of the gdpr can result in fine of much of company annual revenue other government have enacted or are enacting similar data protection law and are considering data localization law that require data to stay within their border all of these evolving compliance and operational requirement impose significant cost and regulatory risk that are likely to increase over time we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiative information technology risk management and disaster recovery plan including investment to retire and replace end of life system the development and maintenance of these measure is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating technology change and effort to overcome security measure become increasingly more intense and sophisticated despite our effort we are not fully insulated from data breach technology disruption or data loss which could adversely impact our competitiveness and result of operation for instance in june tnt express worldwide operation were significantly affected due to the infiltration of an information technology virus known notpetya in may fedex wa one of many company attacked by the rapidly spreading ransomware described wannacry that exploited vulnerability in third party software program and infected computer using that program encrypting file and holding them for ransom additionally during the third quarter of we discovered an unsecured server hosted by one of our third party cloud service provider which exposed some archived account information related to service discontinued after our acquisition of bongo international llc the server ha been secured and we have found no indication that any information ha been misappropriated in connection with the incident neither the wannacry ransomware attack or unsecured server caused material disruption to our system or resulted in any material cost to fedex while we have significant security process and initiative in place we may be unable to detect or prevent material breach or disruption in the future we do not currently have cyber insurance coverage in place but we are evaluating the market for such coverage change in international trade policy could significantly reduce the volume of good transported globally and adversely affect our business the government ha made significant change in trade policy and ha taken certain action that may impact trade including imposing tariff on certain good imported into the united state to date several government including the eu china and india have imposed tariff on certain good imported from the united state any further change in or international trade policy could trigger additional retaliatory action by affected country resulting in trade war and increased cost for good transported globally which may reduce customer demand for these product if the party having to pay those tariff increase their price or in trading partner limiting their trade with country that impose anti trade measure if these consequence are realized the volume of global economic activity may be significantly reduced such reduction could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition the failure to integrate successfully the business and operation of fedex express and tnt express in the expected time frame and at the expected cost may adversely affect our future result prior to fedex acquisition of tnt express in fedex express and tnt express operated independent company there can be no assurance that these business can be integrated successfully it is possible that the integration process could result in higher than expected integration cost the loss of customer the disruption of ongoing business unexpected integration issue or the loss of key historical fedex express or tnt express employee it is also possible that the overall integration process will take longer than currently anticipated specifically the following issue among others must be addressed we integrate the operation of fedex express and tnt express in order to realize the anticipated benefit of the transaction combining the company operation and corporate function combining the business of fedex express and tnt express and meeting the capital requirement of the combination in manner that permit to achieve the operating and financial result we anticipated from the acquisition the failure of which could result in the material anticipated benefit of the transaction not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all integrating and consolidating the company administrative and information technology infrastructure and computer system integrating and restructuring the corporate entity integrating workforce while continuing to provide consistent high quality service to customer integrating and unifying the offering and service available to historical fedex express and tnt express customer harmonizing the company operating practice employee development and compensation program integrity and compliance program internal control and other policy procedure and process integrating the company financial reporting and internal control system maintaining existing agreement with customer and service provider and avoiding delay in entering into new agreement with prospective customer and service provider addressing possible difference in business background corporate culture and management philosophy addressing employee social issue so to maintain efficient and effective labor and employee relation coordinating rebranding and marketing effort managing the movement of certain position to different location managing potential unknown and unidentified liability including liability that are significantly larger than currently anticipated and unforeseen increased expense or delay associated with the integration process and managing the expanded operation of significantly larger more complex company all of these factor could dilute fedex earnings per share decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and negatively impact the price of fedex common stock in addition at time the attention of certain member of our management may be focused on the integration of the business of fedex express and tnt express and diverted from day to day business operation which may disrupt our business our business depend on our strong reputation and the value of the fedex brand the fedex brand name symbolizes high quality service reliability and speed fedex is one of the most widely recognized trusted and respected brand in the world and the fedex brand is one of our most important and valuable asset in addition we have strong reputation among customer and the general public for high standard of social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance and ethic the fedex brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sale and marketing tool and we devote significant resource to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activity by our employee contractor agent or others with we do business such customer service mishap noncompliance with law or the shipment of certain item pursuant to our obligation common carrier operating under federal law could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand with the increase in the use of social medium outlet such facebook youtube instagram and twitter adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly making it increasingly difficult for to effectively respond damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our service and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and result of operation well require additional resource to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand our transportation business are impacted by the price and availability of fuel we must purchase large quantity of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicle and the price and availability of fuel is beyond our control and can be highly volatile to date we have been mostly successful in mitigating over time the expense impact of higher fuel cost through our indexed fuel surcharge the amount of the surcharge is closely linked to the market price for fuel if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharge because of competitive pricing pressure or some other reason fuel cost could adversely impact our operating result of may we had no derivative financial instrument to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuation and we currently have no plan to use derivative financial instrument for this purpose in the future even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharge high fuel surcharge could move our customer away from our higher yielding express service to our lower yielding deferred or ground service or even reduce customer demand for our service altogether in addition disruption in the supply of fuel could have negative impact on our ability to operate our transportation network weather related event natural disaster political disruption or war involving oil producing country change in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation tax or marketing change in refining capacity environmental concern and other unpredictable event may impact fuel supply and could result in shortage in the future our business are capital intensive and we must make capital decision based upon projected volume level we make significant investment in aircraft package handling facility vehicle technology sort equipment copy equipment and other asset to support our transportation and business network we also make significant investment to rebrand integrate and grow the company that we acquire the amount and timing of capital investment depend on various factor including our anticipated volume growth we must make commitment to purchase or modify aircraft year before the aircraft are actually needed we must predict volume level and fleet requirement and make commitment for aircraft based on those projection missing our projection could result in much or too little capacity relative to our shipping volume overcapacity could lead to asset disposition or write down well negatively impact operating margin and undercapacity could negatively impact service level we face intense competition the transportation and business service market are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service especially in period of little or no macroeconomic growth some of our competitor have more financial resource and other competitive advantage than we do or they are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign government which enables them to raise capital more easily we also compete with regional transportation provider that operate smaller and le capital intensive transportation network and startup company that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market need in addition some high volume package shipper such amazon com are developing and implementing in house delivery capability and utilizing independent contractor for delivery which could in turn reduce our revenue and market share we believe we compete effectively with these company for example by providing more reliable service at compensatory price however an irrational pricing environment can limit our ability not only to maintain or increase our price including our fuel surcharge in response to rising fuel cost but also to maintain or grow our market share while we believe we compete effectively through our current and planned service offering if our current competitor or potential future competitor offer broader range of service more effectively bundle their service or offer service at lower price it could impede our ability to maintain or grow our market share moreover if our current customer such amazon com become competitor and bundle transportation with other service it will reduce our revenue and could negatively impact our financial condition and result of operation additionally advancement in technology such advanced safety system automated package sorting handling and delivery vehicle platooning alternative fuel vehicle and digitization of freight service may necessitate that we increase investment in order to remain competitive and our customer may not be willing to accept higher rate to cover the cost of these investment government regulation is evolving and unfavorable change could harm our business we are subject to regulation under wide variety of federal and state and non regulation law and policy there can be no assurance that such regulation law and policy will not be changed in way that will decrease the demand for our service subject to escalating cost or require to modify our business model and objective harming our financial result in particular legislative regulatory or other action that and non government have undertaken or are considering in area such data privacy and sovereignty tax foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility currency control that could restrict the movement of liquidity from particular jurisdiction trade control tariff quota embargo or sanction in the or other country complex economic sanction additional security requirement additional requirement on employee and benefit environmental standard and tax reform may have an effect on our operation liquidity capital requirement effective tax rate and performance for example anti trade or protectionist measure passed in the or other country in which we do business could depress global trade decrease the demand for our service and negatively impact our financial result we could be subject to adverse change in regulation and interpretation or challenge to our tax position relating to the tax cut and job act we are subject to taxation in the and numerous foreign jurisdiction additionally significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax and in the course of our business there are many transaction and calculation where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain from time to time change in tax law or regulation may be proposed or enacted that could significantly affect our overall tax liability for example in december the united state government enacted comprehensive tax legislation through the tcja which significantly change the corporate income tax system the tcja requires complex computation to be performed that were not previously required in tax law significant judgment estimate and calculation to be made in interpreting it provision and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the treasury department the internal revenue service and other standard setting body could interpret or issue guidance on how provision of the tcja will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation in addition further legislative action could be taken to address question or issue caused by the tcja we continue our ongoing analysis of the tcja and it related interpretation collect and prepare necessary data and interpret any additional guidance we may make adjustment to amount that we have recorded that may adversely impact our result of operation and financial condition additionally state and foreign government may enact tax law in response to the tcja or other global initiative that could result in further change to our taxation and adversely impact our result of operation and financial condition if we do not successfully execute or effectively operate integrate leverage and grow acquired business our financial result and reputation may suffer our strategy for long term growth productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to make prudent strategic acquisition and to realize the benefit we expect when we make those acquisition in furtherance of this strategy in addition to tnt express we have acquired business in europe latin america africa and the over the past several year while we expect our past and future acquisition to enhance our value proposition to customer and improve our long term profitability there can be no assurance that we will realize our expectation within the time frame we have established if at all or that we can continue to support the value we allocate to these acquired business including their goodwill or other intangible asset for example in we incurred goodwill impairment charge of million related to fedex supply chain eliminating substantially all of the goodwill attributable to this reporting unit the key factor contributing to the goodwill impairment were underperformance of the fedex supply chain business during including base business erosion and the failure to attain the level of operating synergy and revenue and profit growth anticipated at the time of the acquisition we may not be able to achieve our profit improvement goal by the end of in march we announced that the fedex express group is targeting operating income improvement of billion to billion in from our ability to achieve this objective is dependent on number of factor including the tnt integration progressing planned the health of the global economy stability in global trade future customer demand and current accounting rule and tax law in light of these factor we may not be able to achieve our goal labor organization attempt to organize group of our employee from time to time and potential change in labor law could make it easier for them to do so if we are unable to continue to maintain good relationship with our employee and prevent labor organization from organizing group of our employee our operating cost could significantly increase and our operational flexibility could be significantly reduced despite continual organizing attempt by labor union other than the pilot at fedex express and driver at one fedex freight facility our employee have thus far chosen not to unionize we acquired fedex supply chain formerly genco distribution system inc in which already had small number of employee that are member of union additionally certain of fedex express non employee are unionized the congress ha in the past considered adopting change in labor law however that would make it easier for union to organize unit of our employee for example there is always possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employee from the jurisdiction of the rla for additional discussion of the rla see part item of this annual report under the caption regulation such legislation could expose our customer to the type of service disruption that the rla wa designed to prevent local work stoppage in key area that interrupt the timely flow of shipment of time sensitive high value good throughout our global network such disruption could threaten our ability to provide competitively priced shipping option and ready access to global market there is also the possibility that congress could pas other labor legislation that could adversely affect our company such fedex ground and fedex freight whose employee are governed by the national labor relation act of amended nlra in addition federal and state governmental agency such the national mediation board and the national labor relation board have and may continue to take action that could make it easier for our employee to organize under the rla or nlra finally change to federal or state law governing employee classification could impact the status of fedex ground owner operator independent employer of driver if fedex ground is deemed to be an employer or joint employer of the driver of these independent contractor labor organization could more easily organize these individual our operating cost could increase materially and we could incur significant capital outlay fedex ground relies on owner operator to conduct it linehaul and pickup and delivery operation and the status of these owner operator independent contractor and direct employer of driver providing these service is being challenged fedex ground use of independent contractor is well suited to the need of the ground delivery business and it customer evidenced by the strong growth of this business segment we are involved in lawsuit and administrative proceeding that claim the company owner operator engaged under operating agreement no longer in place should have been treated our employee rather than independent contractor in addition we are defending joint employer case where it is alleged that fedex ground should be treated an employer of the driver employed by owner operator engaged by fedex ground we incur certain cost including legal fee in defending the status of fedex ground owner operator independent contractor we continue to believe that owner operator engaged by fedex ground are properly classified independent contractor and that fedex ground is not an employer or joint employer of the driver of these independent contractor however adverse determination in these matter could among other thing entitle certain of our owner operator and their driver to the reimbursement of certain expense and to the benefit of wage and hour law including the potential for prior period compensation and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for fedex ground and could result in change to the independent contractor status of fedex ground owner operator change to state law governing the definition of independent contractor or employee of independent contractor could also impact the status of fedex ground owner operator disruption or modification in service by the usps or change in it business or financial soundness could have an adverse effect on our operation and financial result the usps is significant customer and vendor of fedex in particular the usps is the largest customer of fedex express which provides domestic air transportation service for the usps first class mail priority mail express and priority mail and transportation and delivery for the usps international delivery service disruption or modification in service by the usps result of financial difficulty or change in it business including any structural change to it operation network service offering or pricing could adversely affect our operation negatively impacting our revenue result of operation and financial condition the uk vote to leave the eu could adversely impact our business result of operation and financial condition there is substantial uncertainty surrounding the uk vote to leave the eu brexit any impact of the brexit vote depends on the term of the uk withdrawal from the eu which wa formally initiated in and could take several year to accomplish the uk withdrawal from the eu could result in global economic downturn which could depress the demand for our service the uk also could lose access to the single eu market and to the global trade deal negotiated by the eu on behalf of it member depressing trade between the uk and other country which would negatively impact our international operation additionally we may face new regulation regarding trade aviation security and employee among others in the uk compliance with such regulation could be costly negatively impacting our business result of operation and financial condition the transportation infrastructure continues to be target of terrorist activity because transportation asset continue to be target of terrorist activity government around the world are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirement that will increase operating cost and potentially slow service for business including those in the transportation industry for example the transportation security administration tsa requires fedex express to comply with full all cargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains evolving and strict security requirement additionally the international civil aviation organization icao currently allows member state to permit carrier and other entity to determine without government oversight which shipper and shipment are secure for purpose of putting those shipment on all cargo aircraft this allowance will be removed by calendar and may require to undergo additional screening and oversight by the tsa and similar government agency internationally security requirement such these are not static but change periodically the result of regulatory and legislative requirement imposing additional security cost and creating level of uncertainty for our operation thus it is reasonably possible that these rule or other future security requirement could impose material cost on or slow our service to our customer the impact on our operation of avoiding area of the world including airspace in which there are geopolitical conflict and the targeting of aircraft by party to those conflict can also be significant moreover terrorist attack directed at fedex or other aspect of the transportation infrastructure could disrupt our operation and adversely impact demand for our service the regulatory environment for global aviation or other transportation right may impact our operation and increase our operating cost our extensive air network is critical to our success our right to serve foreign point is subject to the approval of the department of transportation and generally requires bilateral agreement between the and foreign government in addition we must obtain the permission of foreign government to provide specific flight and service our operation outside of the such fedex express growing international domestic operation are also subject to current and potential regulation including certain postal regulation and licensing requirement that restrict make difficult and sometimes prohibit the ability of foreign owned company such fedex express to compete effectively in part of the international domestic transportation and logistics market regulatory or executive action affecting global aviation or transportation right or failure to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation right in important international market could impair our ability to operate our network we are subject to other extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirement that may result in significant cost for instance the federal aviation administration from time to time issue directive and other regulation relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditure in order to comply we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market response to such change concern over climate change including the impact of global warming ha led to significant and international legislative and regulatory effort to limit greenhouse gas ghg emission including our aircraft and diesel engine emission increasingly state and local government are also considering ghg regulatory requirement compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various country and region are following different approach to the regulation of climate change for example in the european commission approved the extension of the eu emission trading scheme ets for ghg emission to the airline industry under this decision all fedex express flight that are wholly within the eu are now covered by the ets requirement and each year we are required to purchase emission allowance in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emission from such flight also in the icao passed resolution adopting the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation corsia which is global market based emission offset program to encourage carbon neutral growth beyond pilot phase is scheduled to begin in in which country may voluntarily participate and full mandatory participation is scheduled to begin in icao continues to develop detail regarding implementation but compliance with corsia will increase fedex operating cost additionally in the environmental protection agency epa issued finding that aircraft engine ghg emission cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare this finding is regulatory prerequisite to the epa adoption of new certification standard for new aircraft emission expected in or in the past the congress ha also considered bill that would regulate ghg emission and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future however in the withdrew from the paris climate accord an agreement among country to reduce ghg emission and that withdrawal effect on future policy regarding ghg emission on corsia and on other ghg regulation is uncertain nevertheless the extent to which other country implement that agreement could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business increased regulation regarding ghg emission especially aircraft or diesel engine emission could impose substantial cost on especially at fedex express these cost include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital cost associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicle prematurely until the timing scope and extent of such possible regulation becomes known we can not predict it effect on our cost structure or our operating result it is reasonably possible however that it could materially increase our operating expense if instituted moreover even without such regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by company in the airline and transportation industry could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our service especially our air express service finally given the broad and global scope of our operation and our susceptibility to global macroeconomic trend we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risk of climate change that could affect all of humankind such shift in weather pattern and world ecosystem adverse weather or localized disaster in key geography could adversely impact our business while we operate several integrated network with asset distributed throughout the world there are concentration of key asset within our network that are exposed to adverse weather condition or localized risk from natural or manmade disaster such earthquake volcano wildfire hurricane conflict or unrest or terrorist attack the loss of key location such our memphis world hub or one of our information technology center could cause significant disruption to our operation and cause to incur significant cost to reestablish or relocate these function moreover resulting economic dislocation including supply chain and fuel disruption could adversely impact demand for our service we are also subject to other risk and uncertainty including increasing cost the volatility of cost and funding requirement and other legal mandate for employee benefit especially pension and healthcare benefit change in our ability to attract and retain pilot driver and package handler the increasing cost of compliance with federal state and foreign governmental agency mandate including the foreign corrupt practice act and the bribery act and defending against inappropriate or unjustified enforcement or other action by such agency change in foreign currency exchange rate especially in the euro chinese yuan british pound brazilian real canadian dollar and mexican peso which can affect our sale level and foreign currency sale price market acceptance of our new service and growth initiative any liability resulting from and the cost of defending against class action litigation such wage and hour joint employment and discrimination and retaliation claim and any other legal or governmental proceeding the outcome of future negotiation to reach new collective bargaining agreement including with the union that represents the pilot of fedex express the current pilot agreement is scheduled to become amendable in november and with the union elected in to represent driver at fedex freight facility the impact of technology development on our operation and on demand for our service and our ability to continue to identify and eliminate unnecessary information technology redundancy and complexity throughout the organization governmental underinvestment in transportation infrastructure which could increase our cost and adversely impact our service level due to traffic congestion or sub optimal routing of our vehicle and aircraft widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease or any other public health crisis and availability of financing on term acceptable to and our ability to maintain our current credit rating especially

long lived asset long lived asset are reviewed for impairment when circumstance indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable for asset that are to be held and used an impairment is recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flow associated with the asset or group of asset is le than their carrying value if impairment exists an adjustment is made to write the asset down to it fair value and loss is recorded the difference between the carrying value and fair value fair value are determined based on quoted market value discounted cash flow or internal and external appraisal applicable asset to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value we operate integrated transportation network and accordingly cash flow for most of our operating asset to be held and used are assessed at network level not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment in the normal management of our aircraft fleet we routinely idle aircraft and engine temporarily due to maintenance cycle and adjustment of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand level temporarily idled asset are classified available for use and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these asset these temporarily idled asset are assessed for impairment on quarterly basis the criterion for determining whether an asset ha been permanently removed from service and result is potentially impaired include but are not limited to our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume level including capacity need during our peak shipping season the introduction of new fleet type or decision to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operation and change to planned service expansion activity at may we had five aircraft temporarily idled these aircraft have been idled for an average of month and are expected to return to revenue service sale of business on april we sold non core business of tnt express tnt express and recorded gain of million in the fedex express segment goodwill goodwill is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net asset of business acquired several factor give rise to goodwill in our acquisition such the expected benefit from synergy of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment in our evaluation of goodwill impairment we perform qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive we proceed to test goodwill for impairment including comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying value including attributable goodwill fair value for our reporting unit is determined using an income or market approach incorporating market participant consideration and management assumption on revenue growth rate operating margin discount rate and expected capital expenditure fair value determination may include both internal and third party valuation unless circumstance otherwise dictate we perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter intangible asset intangible asset primarily include customer relationship technology asset and trademark acquired in business combination intangible asset are amortized over period ranging from to year either on straight line basis or on basis consistent with the pattern in which the economic benefit are realized pension and postretirement healthcare plan our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan are measured using actuarial technique that reflect management assumption for discount rate investment return on plan asset salary increase expected retirement mortality employee turnover and future increase in healthcare cost we determine the discount rate which is required to be the rate at which the projected benefit obligation pbo could be effectively settled of the measurement date with the assistance of actuary who calculate the yield on theoretical portfolio of high grade corporate bond rated aa or better with cash flow that are designed to match our expected benefit payment in future year we use the fair value of plan asset to calculate the expected return on asset eroa for interim and segment reporting purpose our eroa is judgmental matter which is reviewed on an annual basis and revised appropriate the accounting guidance related to employer accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of these plan we use mark to market or mtm accounting and immediately recognize change in the fair value of plan asset and actuarial gain or loss in our operating result annually in the fourth quarter each year the annual mtm adjustment is recognized at the corporate level and doe not impact segment result the remaining component of pension and postretirement healthcare expense primarily service and interest cost and the eroa are recorded on quarterly basis income tax deferred income tax are provided for the tax effect of temporary difference between the tax basis of asset and liability and their reported amount in the financial statement the liability method is used to account for income tax which requires deferred tax to be recorded at the statutory rate expected to be in effect when the tax are paid deferred income tax asset represent amount available to reduce income tax payable on taxable income in future year such asset arise because of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability well from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deduction and credit by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategy these source of income rely heavily on estimate to make this determination and thus there is risk that these estimate will have to be revised new information is received to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that deferred tax asset will be recovered valuation allowance is established we believe we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefit related to the remaining net deferred tax asset in our consolidated balance sheet that are not subject to valuation allowance we recognize liability for uncertain income tax position based on two step process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any the second step requires to estimate and measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amount we must determine the probability of various possible outcome we reevaluate these uncertain tax position on quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management these reevaluation are based on factor including but not limited to change in fact or circumstance change in tax law successfully settled issue under audit and new audit activity such change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of tax benefit or an increase to the related provision we classify interest related to income tax

line basis over the lease term the cumulative excess of rent payment over rent expense is accounted for deferred lease asset and recorded in other asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet the cumulative excess of rent expense over rent payment is accounted for deferred lease obligation leasehold improvement associated with asset utilized under capital or operating lease are amortized over the shorter of the asset useful life or the lease term deferred gain gain on the sale and leaseback of aircraft and other property and equipment are deferred and amortized ratably over the life of the lease reduction of rent expense substantially all of these deferred gain are related to aircraft transaction derivative financial instrument our risk management strategy includes the select use

including goodwill and purchase price allocation note recent accounting guidance new accounting rule and disclosure requirement can significantly impact our reported result and the comparability of our financial statement we believe the following new accounting guidance is relevant to the reader of our financial statement in december the security and exchange commission sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab to provide guidance to registrant in accounting for income tax under the tax cut and job act tcja see note for further discussion related to applying this guidance during the first quarter of we early adopted the accounting standard update issued by the financial accounting standard board fasb related to intra entity transfer of asset other than inventory this update requires company to recognize the income tax consequence of intra entity transfer of asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs opposed to when the asset are ultimately sold to an outside party result of this new guidance during we recorded million income tax benefit and million adjustment to retained earnings for the cumulative effect at adoption in january the fasb issued an accounting standard update that simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill eliminating step from the goodwill impairment test under this new guidance an entity should perform it annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of reporting unit with it carrying amount an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit fair value up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit we adopted the guidance during the fourth quarter of in the fasb and international accounting standard board issued new accounting standard that will supersede virtually all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principle in the united state the fundamental principle of the new guidance are that company should recognize revenue in manner that reflects the timing of the transfer of service to customer and the amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that company expects to receive for the good and service provided the new guidance establishes five step approach for the recognition of revenue we finalized our assessment of the impact of this new standard on our consolidated financial statement and related disclosure including detailed contract review and adopted this standard of june fiscal we have analyzed our internal control over financial reporting framework and determined that there will be new control around contract inception and contract modification well periodic review of material contract we determined that the new guidance will not have material impact on our revenue recognition policy practice or system in march the fasb issued an accounting standard update that change how employer that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement benefit plan present the net periodic benefit cost in the income statement this new guidance requires entity to report the service cost component in the same line item or item other compensation cost the other component of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component outside of income from operation this standard will impact our operating income but will have no impact on our net income or earnings per share for example adoption of this guidance would have reduced operating income by million in and by million in but would not have impacted our net income in these period this new guidance is effective june and will be applied retrospectively in the fasb issued new lease accounting standard which requires lessee to put most lease on their balance sheet but recognize the expense in their income statement in manner similar to current practice the new standard state that lessee will recognize lease liability for the obligation to make lease payment and right of use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term expense related to lease determined to be operating lease will be recognized on straight line basis while those determined to be financing lease will be recognized following front loaded expense profile in which interest and amortization are presented separately in the income statement based on our lease portfolio we currently anticipate recognizing lease liability and related right of use asset on our balance sheet in excess of billion with an immaterial impact on our income statement compared to the current lease accounting model however the ultimate impact of the standard will depend on the company lease portfolio of the adoption date we are currently accumulating all of the necessary information required to properly account for the lease under the new standard additionally we are implementing an enterprise wide lease management system to assist in the accounting and are evaluating additional change to our process and internal control to ensure we meet the standard reporting and disclosure requirement these change will be effective june fiscal in february the fasb issued an accounting standard update that will permit company to reclassify the income tax effect of the tcja on item within aoci to retained earnings these change will be effective june fiscal note business combination on march we acquired mailing limited leading provider of worldwide low cost commerce transportation solution for million

tax expense of million and million respectively primary component are billion benefit from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability and million one time benefit from contribution to our pension plan in february includes benefit from share based payment of million and million in and respectively our tax rate wa favorably impacted by the enactment of the tcja during the third quarter in accordance with sab we have recorded provisional benefit of billion related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability and an immaterial provisional benefit from the one time transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings in addition we recognized benefit of million related to lower statutory income tax rate on earnings and one time benefit of million from billion contribution to our pension plan in february our tax rate also included net benefit of million from tax basis step up attributable to corporate structuring transaction part of the ongoing integration of fedex express and tnt express we also recorded benefit of million from foreign tax credit generated by distribution to the from our foreign operation our tax rate wa favorably impacted by million result of the implementation of new foreign currency tax regulation the tcja make broad and complex change to the tax code that affected in multiple way including but not limited to reducing our federal income tax rate from to discussed below providing for additional first year depreciation by allowing full expensing of qualified property placed into service after september and requiring to calculate one time tax liability on those earnings which have not previously been repatriated to the the transition tax sab wa issued to address the application of generally accepted accounting principle in situation when registrant doe not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to finalize the calculation for certain income tax effect of the tcja in accordance with sab we have made reasonable estimate and recorded provisional amount described below under the transitional provision of sab we have one year measurement period to complete the accounting for the initial tax effect of the tcja we are still in the process of completing that accounting the tcja reduced the corporate tax rate from to effective january tax law stipulates that our earnings are subject to blended tax rate of which is based on the prorated number of day in the fiscal year before and after the effective date result we have remeasured certain deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability accordingly and recorded provisional net tax benefit of billion the transition tax is based on our total accumulated post foreign earnings and profit the majority of which wa previously considered to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no federal and state income tax were provided we recorded provisional immaterial tax benefit from foreign tax credit exceeding the one time transition tax liability and an immaterial provisional amount for state income tax because of the complexity of the tcja we are still finalizing our analysis of the transition tax liability calculation no additional income tax have been provided for any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entity beyond those basis difference triggered by the transition tax these amount continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operation determining the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any additional outside basis difference in these entity stock basis difference attributable to acquisition or other permanent difference is not practicable we will complete our analysis of the impact of the tcja on our outside basis difference in subsidiary and respective indefinite reinvestment assertion during the measurement period and make additional disclosure if necessary with respect to the new tcja provision on global intangible low tax income which will apply to starting in we have not made an accounting policy election on the deferred tax treatment consequently we have not made an accrual for the deferred tax aspect of this provision our accounting for the income tax effect of the tcja will be completed during the measurement period allowed under sab and we will record any necessary adjustment in the period such adjustment are identified while we were able to make reasonable estimate of the impact of the income tax effect of the new law it may be affected by among other item further analysis of certain aspect of the tcja subsequent guidance issued by the government and change to estimate made to calculate our existing temporary difference the significant component of deferred tax asset and liability of may were follows in million deferred tax asset deferred tax liability deferred tax asset deferred tax liability property equipment lease and intangible employee benefit self insurance accrual other net operating loss credit carryforwards valuation allowance the net deferred tax liability of may have been classified in the balance sheet follows in million noncurrent deferred tax asset noncurrent deferred tax liability noncurrent deferred tax asset are included in the line item other asset in our consolidated balance sheet we have approximately billion of net operating loss carryovers in various foreign jurisdiction and million of state operating loss carryovers the valuation allowance primarily represent amount reserved for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards which expire over varying period starting in therefore we establish valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that deferred income tax asset will not be realized we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefit related to the remaining net deferred tax asset in our consolidated balance sheet see note above for more information on our policy for assessing the recoverability of deferred tax asset and valuation allowance we are subject to taxation in the and various state local and foreign jurisdiction the internal revenue service is currently auditing our and tax return it is reasonably possible that certain income tax return proceeding will be completed during the next month and could result in change in our balance of unrecognized tax benefit the expected impact of any change would not be material to our consolidated financial statement reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefit is follows in million balance at beginning of year increase for tax position taken in the current year increase for tax position taken in prior year increase for business acquisition decrease for tax position taken in prior year settlement decrease from lapse of statute of limitation change due to currency translation balance at end of year our liability recorded for uncertain tax position include million at may and million at may associated with position that if favorably resolved would provide benefit to our effective tax rate we classify interest related to income tax liability interest expense and if applicable penalty are recognized component of income tax expense the balance of accrued interest and penalty wa million on may and million on may total interest and penalty included in our consolidated statement of income are immaterial it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for tax position change may result from the conclusion of ongoing audit appeal or litigation in state local federal and foreign tax jurisdiction or from the resolution of various proceeding between and foreign tax authority our liability for uncertain tax position includes no matter that are individually or collectively material to it is reasonably possible that the amount of the benefit with respect to certain of our unrecognized tax position will increase or decrease within the next month but an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change can not be made however we do not expect that the resolution of any of our uncertain tax position will have material effect on note retirement plan we sponsor program that provide retirement benefit to most of our employee these program include defined benefit pension plan defined contribution plan and postretirement healthcare plan the accounting guidance related to postretirement benefit requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan and the recognition in either expense or aoci of unrecognized gain or loss and prior service cost or credit we use mtm accounting for the recognition of our actuarial gain and loss related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plan described in note the funded status is measured the difference between the fair value of the plan asset and the pbo of the plan summary of our retirement plan cost over the past three year is follows in million defined benefit pension plan defined contribution plan postretirement healthcare plan retirement plan mark to market gain loss the component of the mtm adjustment are follows in million discount rate change demographic assumption experience annuity contract purchase actual versus expected return on asset total mark to market gain loss the weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan increased from at may to at may the demographic assumption experience in reflects liability loss due to unfavorable result related to various demographic assumption the annuity contract purchase loss relates to the contract with metropolitan life insurance company discussed below the actual rate of return which is net of all fee and expense on our pension plan asset of wa slightly lower than our expected return of primarily due to generally flat return in the long duration fixed income portfolio partially offset by strong return from global equity the actual rate of return on our pension plan asset which is net of all fee and expense of wa higher than our expected return of primarily due to rise in the value of global equity market in addition to favorable credit market condition the weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan decreased from at may to at may the demographic assumption experience in reflects an update in mortality table for pension and other postemployment benefit plan the actual rate of return on our pension plan asset of net of all fee and expense wa lower than our expected return of primarily due to challenging environment for global equity and other risk seeking asset class the weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan declined from at may to at may the demographic assumption experience in reflects change in disability rate and an increase in the average retirement age for pension and other postemployment benefit plan pension plan our largest pension plan cover certain employee age and over with at least one year of service pension benefit for most employee are accrued under cash balance formula we call the portable pension account under the portable pension account the retirement benefit is expressed dollar amount in notional account that grows with annual credit based on pay age and year of credited service and interest on the notional account balance the portable pension account benefit is payable lump sum or an annuity at retirement at the election of the employee the plan interest credit rate varies from year to year based on treasury index prior to certain employee earned benefit using traditional pension formula based on average earnings and year of service benefit under this formula were capped on may for most employee we also sponsor or participate in nonqualified benefit plan covering certain of our employee group and other pension plan covering certain of our international employee the international defined benefit pension plan provide benefit primarily based on earnings and year of service and are funded in compliance with local law and practice the majority of our international obligation are for defined benefit pension plan in the netherlands and the united kingdom during our pension plan were amended to permit former employee with vested traditional pension benefit to make one time irrevocable election to receive their benefit in lump sum distribution approximately former employee elected to receive this lump sum distribution and total of approximately billion wa paid by the plan in may in may we entered into an agreement with metropolitan life insurance company to purchase group annuity contract and transfer approximately billion of our pension plan obligation the transaction transferred responsibility for pension benefit to metropolitan life insurance company for approximately of our retiree and beneficiary who satisfy certain condition and currently receive monthly benefit from participating pension plan there wa no change to the pension benefit for any plan participant result of this transaction the purchase of the group annuity contract wa funded directly by asset of the pension plan we recognized million one time settlement loss in connection with this transaction which is included in our year end mtm retirement plan adjustment postretirement healthcare plan certain of our subsidiary offer medical dental and vision coverage to eligible retiree and their eligible dependent and small number of international employee employee covered by the principal plan become eligible for these benefit at age and older if they have permanent continuous service of at least year after attainment of age if hired prior to january or at least year after attainment of age if hired on or after january postretirement healthcare benefit are capped at of the per caput projected employer cost which ha been reached under most plan so these benefit are not subject to future inflation effective january certain of our postretirement healthcare benefit were converted to lump sum benefit in notional retiree health reimbursement account hra for eligible participant the hra is available to reimburse participant for qualifying healthcare premium cost and limit the company liability to the hra account balance the amount of the credit is based on age at january or upon age at retirement thereafter in connection with this change retiree health coverage wa closed to most new employee hired on or after january pension plan assumption the accounting for pension and postretirement healthcare plan includes numerous assumption such discount rate expected long term investment return on plan asset future salary increase employee turnover mortality and retirement age weighted average actuarial assumption

level used to determine net periodic benefit cost expected long term rate of return on asset our pension plan asset are invested primarily in publicly tradable security and our pension plan hold only minimal investment in fedex common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third party pension fund investment manager part of our strategy to manage pension cost and funded status volatility we follow liability driven investment strategy to better align plan asset with liability establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension asset is judgmental matter which we review on an annual basis and revise appropriate management considers the following factor in determining this assumption the duration of our pension plan liability which drive the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan asset the type of investment class in which we invest our pension plan asset and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment class to earn over time net of all fee and expense and the investment return we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the return we could expect if investment were made strictly in indexed fund for consolidated pension expense we assumed expected long term rate of return on our pension plan asset in and for we have increased our eroa assumption to the decrease in the number of retiree in payment status due to the purchase of the group annuity contract in may will reduce our short term future cash outlay for the pension plan and allow the remaining asset to be placed in longer duration investment which is expected to increase the rate of return on asset also the elimination of pension benefit guaranty corporation fixed and variable rate premium due to the reduction in the number of participant in our pension plan will increase the net return on asset for the year period ended may our actual return wa net of all fee and expense the investment strategy for our pension plan asset is to utilize diversified mix of public equity fixed income and alternative investment to earn long term investment return that meet our pension plan obligation our largest asset class are corporate fixed income security and government fixed income security which are largely benchmarked against the barclays long government barclays long corporate or the citigroup strip index and and non equity which are mainly benchmarked to the index and msci index accordingly we do not have any significant concentration of risk active management strategy are utilized within the plan in an effort to realize investment return in excess of market index our investment strategy also includes the limited use of derivative financial instrument on discretionary basis to improve investment return and manage exposure to market risk the following is description of the valuation methodology used for investment measured at fair value cash and cash equivalent these level investment include cash cash equivalent and foreign currency valued using exchange rate these level investment include short term investment fund which are collective fund priced at constant value by the administrator of the fund domestic international and global equity these level investment are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which the individual security are traded these level investment include mutual fund fixed income we determine the fair value of these level corporate bond and non government security and other fixed income security by using bid evaluation pricing model or quoted price of security with similar characteristic alternative investment the valuation of these level investment requires significant judgment due to the absence of quoted market price the inherent lack of liquidity and the long term nature of such asset investment in private equity debt real estate hedge fund and other private investment are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and or general partner these estimate incorporate factor such contribution and distribution market

thereafter total note contingency independent contractor lawsuit and administrative proceeding fedex ground is involved in lawsuit and administrative proceeding claiming that owner operator engaged under operating agreement no longer in place should have been treated employee of fedex ground rather than independent contractor in addition we are defending joint employer case where it is alleged that fedex ground should be treated an employer of the driver employed by owner operator engaged by fedex ground these case are in varying stage of litigation and we are not currently able to estimate an amount or range of potential loss in all of these matter however we do not expect to incur individually or in the aggregate material loss in these matter nevertheless adverse determination in matter related to owner operator engaged by fedex ground could among other thing entitle certain owner operator to the reimbursement of certain expense and their driver to the benefit of wage and hour law and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for fedex ground we continue to believe that owner operator engaged by fedex ground are properly classified independent contractor and that fedex ground is not an employer or joint employer of the driver of these independent contractor city and state of new york cigarette suit the city of new york and the state of new york filed two related lawsuit against fedex ground in december and november arising from fedex ground alleged shipment of cigarette to new york resident in contravention of several statute including

dismissed entirely and the new york public health law claim ha been limited to claim arising after september when an amendment to that law provided enforcement authority to the city of new york and state of new york other claim including the rico claim remain in both lawsuit the likelihood of loss is reasonably possible but the amount or range of loss if any can not be estimated at this stage of the litigation we expect the amount of any loss to be immaterial on july the city of new york and the state of new york filed third lawsuit against fedex ground and included fedex freight co defendant this additional case identifies no shipper or shipment but generally alleges violation of the same law that are the subject of the other two lawsuit the amount or range of loss if any can not be
