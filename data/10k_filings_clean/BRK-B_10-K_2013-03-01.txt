reference room at fifth street washington sec table of content item risk factor berkshire and it subsidiary referred to herein or similar expression are subject to certain risk and uncertainty in our business operation which are described below the risk and uncertainty described below are not the only risk we face additional risk and uncertainty that are not presently known or are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operation our tolerance for risk in our insurance business may result in significant underwriting loss when properly paid for the risk assumed we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from single event than any other insurer ha knowingly assumed accordingly we could incur significant loss from single event we may also write coverage for loss arising from act of terrorism we attempt to take into account all possible correlation and avoid writing group of policy from which pre tax loss might aggregate above billion currently we estimate that our aggregate exposure from single risk under outstanding policy is significantly below billion however it is possible that despite our effort loss may aggregate in way that were not anticipated our tolerance for significant insurance loss will likely result in lower reported earnings or net loss in future period the degree of estimation error inherent in the process of estimating property and casualty insurance loss reserve may result in significant underwriting loss the principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claim in writing property and casualty insurance policy we receive premium today and promise to pay covered loss in the future however it will take decade before all claim that have occurred of any given balance sheet date will be reported and settled although we believe that liability for unpaid loss are adequate we will not know whether these liability or the premium charged for the coverage provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date except for certain product line our objective is to generate underwriting profit over the long term estimating insurance claim cost is inherently imprecise our estimated unpaid loss arising under contract covering property and casualty insurance risk are large billion at december even small percentage increase to the aggregate liability estimate can result in materially lower future periodic reported earnings investment are unusually concentrated and fair value are subject to loss in value we concentrate high percentage of our investment in equity security in low number of company and diversify our investment portfolio far le than is conventional in the insurance industry significant decline in the fair value of our larger investment may produce material decline in our consolidated shareholder equity and our consolidated book value per share under certain circumstance significant decline in the fair value of these investment may require the recognition of other than temporary impairment loss large percentage of our investment are held in our insurance company and decrease in the fair value of our investment could produce large decline in statutory surplus our large statutory surplus serf competitive advantage and material decline could have material adverse affect our ability to write new insurance business thus affecting our future underwriting profitability derivative contract may require significant future cash settlement payment and result in significant loss we have assumed the risk of potentially significant loss under equity index put option and credit default contract although we received considerable premium compensation for accepting these risk there is no assurance that the premium we received will exceed our aggregate loss or settlement payment our risk of loss under equity index put option contract are based on decline in equity price of stock comprising certain major stock index the contract expire beginning in and we could be required to make payment when these contract expire if equity index price are significantly below the strike price specified in the contract while the risk under the credit default contract are limited to specified entity amount per entity and aggregate contract limit the deterioration of the financial condition of the referenced entity could result in significant loss although our loss and settlement payment from credit event have not been significant and our remaining exposure decreased significantly in the risk of additional loss or settlement payment and loss in our earnings from credit default continue into the future the equity index put option and credit default contract are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet and the periodic change in fair value are reported in earnings the valuation of these contract and the impact on our earnings can be particularly significant reflecting the volatility of equity and credit market adverse change in equity and credit market may result in material loss in periodic earnings table of content we are dependent on few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decision major investment decision and all major capital allocation decision are made by warren buffett chairman of the board of director and ceo age in consultation with charles munger vice chairman of the board of director age if for any reason the service of our key personnel particularly mr buffett were to become unavailable there could be material adverse effect on our operation however berkshire board of director ha identified three current berkshire subsidiary manager who in their judgment are capable of succeeding mr buffett berkshire board ha agreed on replacement for mr buffett should replacement be needed currently the board continually monitor this risk and could alter it current view regarding replacement for mr buffett in the future we believe that the board succession plan together with the outstanding manager running our numerous and highly diversified operating unit help to mitigate this risk we need qualified personnel to manage and operate our various business in our decentralized business model we need qualified and competent management to direct day to day business activity of our operating subsidiary our operating subsidiary also need qualified and competent personnel in executing their business plan and serving their customer supplier and other stakeholder change in demographic training requirement and the unavailability of qualified personnel could negatively impact our operating subsidiary ability to meet demand of customer to supply good and service recruiting and retaining qualified personnel is important to all of our operation although we have adequate personnel for the current business environment unpredictable increase in demand for good and service may exacerbate the risk of not sufficient number of trained personnel which could have negative impact on our operating result financial condition and liquidity the past growth rate in berkshire book value per share is not an indication of future result in the year since our present management acquired control of berkshire our book value per share ha grown at highly satisfactory rate because of the large size of our capital base shareholder equity of approximately billion of december our book value per share will very likely not increase in the future at rate even close to it past rate risk unique to our regulated business insurance business our insurance business are subject to regulation in the jurisdiction in which we operate such regulation may relate to among other thing the type of business that can be written the rate that can be charged for coverage the level of capital that must be maintained and restriction on the type and size of investment that can be made regulation may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payment accordingly change in regulation related to these or other matter or regulatory action imposing restriction on our insurance company may adversely impact our result of operation railroad business our railroad business conducted through bnsf is subject to significant number of governmental law and regulation with respect to rate and practice railroad operation and variety of health safety labor environmental and other matter failure to comply with applicable law and regulation could have material adverse effect on bnsf business government may change the legislative and or regulatory framework within which bnsf operates without providing any recourse for any adverse effect that the change may have on the business federal legislation enacted in mandate the implementation of positive train control technology by december on certain mainline track where intercity and commuter passenger railroad operate and where toxic by inhalation tih hazardous material are transported this type of technology is new and deploying it across bnsf railway system and other railroad may pose significant operating and implementation risk and requires significant capital expenditure bnsf derives significant amount of revenue from the transportation of coal to the extent that change in government environmental policy limit or restrict the usage of coal source of fuel in generating electricity or alternate fuel such natural gas displace coal on competitive basis bnsf revenue and earnings could be adversely affected common carrier bnsf is also required to transport tih chemical and other hazardous material an accidental release of hazardous material could expose bnsf to significant claim loss penalty and environmental remediation obligation increased economic regulation of the rail industry could negatively impact bnsf ability to determine price for rail service and to make capital improvement to it rail network resulting in an adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition or liquidity table of content utility and energy business our utility and energy business are highly regulated by numerous federal state local and foreign governmental authority in the jurisdiction in which they operate these law and regulation are complex dynamic and subject to new interpretation or change regulation affect almost every aspect of our utility and energy business

transmission and distribution system to meet their customer need and reliability criterion additionally such system may need to be operational for very long period of time in order to justify the financial investment the risk of operational or financial failure of capital project is not necessarily recoverable through rate that are charged to customer competition and technology may erode our business franchise and result in lower earnings each of our operating business face intense competitive pressure within market in which they operate while we manage our business with the objective of achieving long term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantage many factor including market and technology change may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantage accordingly future operating result will depend to some degree on whether our operating unit are successful in protecting or enhancing their competitive advantage if our operating business are unsuccessful in these effort our periodic operating result in the future may decline from current level deterioration of general economic condition may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to access capital market at reasonable cost our operating business are subject to normal economic cycle affecting the economy in general or the industry in which they operate to the extent that the recovery from the recent economic recession continues to be slow or the economy worsens for prolonged period of time one or more of our significant operation could be materially

having access to borrowed fund through the capital market at reasonable rate to the extent that access to the capital market is restricted or the cost of funding increase these operation could be adversely affected civil unrest and terrorism act could hurt our operating business historically we derived relatively small amount of our revenue and earnings from international market globally our business are conducted primarily in region where relatively stable political condition have prevailed however certain of our business operation are subject to relatively higher risk from unstable political condition and civil unrest further terrorism activity deriving from unstable condition or act intended to compromise the integrity or security of our computer network and information system in general could produce significant loss to our worldwide operation our business operation could be adversely affected directly through the loss of human resource or destruction of production

operating business are managed on an unusually decentralized basis there are essentially no centralized or integrated business function such sale marketing purchasing legal or human resource and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day to day business activity of the operating business our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decision investment activity and the selection of the chief executive to head each of the operating business it also is responsible for establishing and monitoring berkshire corporate governance effort including but not limited to communicating the appropriate tone at the top message to it employee and associate monitoring governance effort including those at the operating business and participating in the resolution of governance related issue needed the business segment data note to the consolidated financial statement should be read in conjunction with this discussion insurance underwriting result in included after tax loss of approximately million from hurricane sandy in and underwriting result included after tax loss of approximately billion and million respectively from catastrophe event occurring in those year our railroad and utility and energy business continued to generate significant earnings in earnings from our manufacturing service and retailing business in increased significantly over due primarily to the acquisition of the lubrizol corporation lubrizol which wa completed on september excluding the impact of lubrizol earnings from our manufacturing service and retailing business were mixed reflecting significant improvement in our carpet business modest improvement in our other building product business in the and earnings decline in several foreign market of our manufacturing and service operation in after tax investment and derivative gain were approximately billion which included reduction in estimated liability under equity index put option contract settlement and expiration of credit default contract and net gain from investment disposal in after tax investment and derivative loss were million reflecting after tax loss of billion related to increase in liability under our equity index put option contract and other than temporary impairment otti loss of million related to certain equity and fixed

derivative gain were million and included one time holding gain of million related to our acquisition of bnsf net gain from the disposition of investment and net gain from derivative contract partially offset by otti loss recorded with respect to certain fixed maturity and equity security we believe that investment gain loss are often meaningless in term of understanding our reported result or evaluating our economic performance the timing and magnitude of investment and derivative gain and loss ha caused and will likely continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings table of content management discussion continued insurance underwriting we engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property casualty life and health risk in primary insurance activity we assume defined portion of the risk of loss from person or organization that are directly subject to the risk in reinsurance activity we assume defined portion of similar or dissimilar risk that other insurer or reinsurers have subjected to in their own insuring activity our insurance and reinsurance business are geico general re berkshire hathaway reinsurance group bhrg and berkshire hathaway primary group our management view insurance business possessing two distinct operation underwriting and investing underwriting decision are the responsibility of the unit manager investing decision with limited exception are the responsibility of berkshire chairman and ceo warren buffett accordingly we evaluate performance of underwriting operation without any allocation of investment income the timing and amount of catastrophe loss can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting result in we recorded aggregate pre tax loss of approximately billion attributable to hurricane sandy in we recorded pre tax loss of approximately billion arising primarily from the earthquake in japan and new zealand in the first quarter well weather related event in the pacific rim and the our periodic underwriting result are regularly affected by change in estimate for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense including amount established for occurrence in prior year in we reduced estimated liability related to certain retroactive reinsurance contract which resulted in an increase in pre tax underwriting earnings of approximately million these reduction were primarily due to lower than expected loss experience of one ceding company actual claim settlement and revised loss estimate will develop over time which will likely differ from the liability estimate recorded of year end approximately billion accordingly the unpaid loss estimate recorded of december may develop upward or downward in future period with corresponding decrease or increase respectively to pre tax earnings our periodic underwriting result may also include significant foreign currency transaction gain and loss arising from the change in the valuation of certain non dollar denominated reinsurance liability of our based subsidiary result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation in recent year currency exchange rate have been volatile and the resulting impact on our underwriting earnings ha been significant key marketing strategy followed by all of our insurance business is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength statutory surplus of our insurance business wa approximately billion at december this superior capital strength creates opportunity especially with respect to reinsurance activity to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contract

increased in the two to four percent range and bodily injury severity increased in the one to three percent range from underwriting expense incurred in increased million compared with the increase wa primarily the result of change in gaap concerning deferred policy acquisition cost dpac dpac represents the underwriting cost that are eligible to be capitalized and expensed premium are earned over the policy period upon adoption of the new accounting standard of january geico ceased deferring large portion of it advertising cost the new accounting standard wa adopted on prospective basis and result dpac recorded of december wa amortized to expense over the remainder of the related policy period in policy acquisition cost related to policy written and renewed after december are being deferred at lower level than in the past the new accounting standard for dpac doe not impact the cash basis periodic underwriting cost or our assessment of geico underwriting performance however the new accounting standard accelerates the timing of when certain underwriting cost are recognized in earnings we estimate that geico underwriting expense in would have been about million le had we computed dpac under the prior accounting standard and that result geico expense ratio the ratio of underwriting expense to premium earned in would have been le than in premium earned in increased million over voluntary auto policy in force increased approximately compared to the increase in policy in force in reflected an increase of in voluntary auto new business sale voluntary auto policy in force at december were approximately greater than at december loss and loss adjustment expense incurred in increased million compared to increasing at greater rate than premium earned result the loss

accumulated other comprehensive income when recorded otti loss have no impact whatsoever on the asset value otherwise recorded in our consolidated balance sheet or on our consolidated shareholder equity in addition the recognition of such loss in earnings rather than in accumulated other comprehensive income doe not necessarily indicate that sale are imminent or planned and sale ultimately may not occur for number of year furthermore the recognition of otti loss doe not necessarily indicate that the loss in value of the security is permanent or that the market price of the security will not subsequently increase to and ultimately exceed our original cost of december unrealized loss on our investment in equity and fixed maturity security determined on an individual purchase lot basis were million we consider several factor in determining whether or not impairment are deemed to be other than temporary including the current and expected long term business prospect and if applicable the creditworthiness of the issuer our ability and intent to hold the investment until the price recovers and the length of time and relative magnitude of the price decline security price may remain below cost for period of time that may be deemed excessive from the standpoint of interpreting existing accounting rule even though other factor suggest that the price will eventually recover result accounting regulation may require that we recognize otti loss in earnings in instance where we may strongly believe that the market price of the impaired security will recover to at least our original cost and where we posse the ability and intent to hold the security until at least that time derivative gain loss primarily represent the change in fair value of our credit default and equity index put option contract periodic change in the fair value of these contract are reflected in earnings and can be significant reflecting the volatility of underlying credit and equity market we have not actively traded into and out of credit default and equity index put option contract under many of the contract no settlement will occur until the contract expiration date which may occur many year from now in we recorded pre tax gain from derivative contract of approximately billion which included gain from our equity index put option contract of approximately billion the gain from equity index put option contract were due to increased index value foreign currency exchange rate change and valuation adjustment on small number of contract where contractual settlement are determined differently than the standard determination of intrinsic value partially offset by lower interest rate assumption our ultimate payment obligation if any under our remaining equity index put option contract will be determined of the contract expiration date which begin in based on the intrinsic value defined under the contract of those date our recorded liability for these contract wa approximately billion of december in we recorded pre tax loss of approximately billion on our equity index put option contract the loss reflected decline ranging from about to with respect to three of the four equity index covered under our contract and lower interest rate assumption in gain on equity index put option contract were million in we settled certain equity index put option contract early at the request of the counterparty and recorded gain of million which is the difference between the recorded fair value of these contract at the beginning of and the settlement payment amount otherwise we recognized pre tax loss of million under our remaining equity index put option contract reflecting generally lower interest rate assumption and the effect of foreign currency exchange rate change there were no new equity contract entered into or other settlement during the three year period ending december table of content management discussion continued investment and derivative gain loss continued in we recognized pre tax gain of million on credit default contract such gain were attributable to narrower spread and the passage of time reduced time exposure well from settlement of certain contract no new credit default contract were written during the past three year significant portion of our risk related to non investment grade corporate issuer expired in the fourth quarter of and all remaining exposure related to corporate issuer expire in we recorded pre tax loss of million on our credit default contract in and gain of million in the loss in were primarily related to our contract involving non investment grade corporate issuer due to widening credit default spread and loss event the gain in reflected the overall narrowing of credit default spread for corporate issuer and were somewhat offset by loss due to the widening of spread for municipality financial condition our balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and strong capital base our consolidated shareholder

summary of our consolidated liability for unpaid property and casualty loss is presented in the table below except for certain worker compensation liability all liability for unpaid property and casualty loss referred to in this section gross unpaid loss are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet without discounting for time value regardless of the length of the claim tail amount are in million gross unpaid loss net unpaid loss dec dec dec dec geico general re bhrg berkshire hathaway primary group total net of reinsurance recoverable and deferred charge on reinsurance assumed and before foreign currency translation effect we record liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contract based upon estimate of the ultimate amount payable under the contract with respect to loss occurring on or before the balance sheet date the timing and amount of loss payment is subject to great degree of variability and is contingent upon among other thing the timing of claim reporting from insured and cedants and the determination of the ultimate loss amount through the loss adjustment process variety of technique are used in establishing the liability for unpaid loss regardless of the technique used significant judgment and assumption are necessary in projecting the ultimate amount payable in the future result uncertainty are imbedded in and permeate the actuarial loss reserving technique and process used table of content management discussion continued property and casualty loss continued of any balance sheet date not all claim that have occurred have been reported and not all reported claim have been settled loss and loss adjustment expense reserve include provision for reported claim referred to case reserve and for claim that have not been reported referred to incurred but not yet reported ibnr reserve the time period between the loss occurrence date and settlement payment date is referred to the claim tail property claim usually have fairly short claim tail and absent litigation are reported and settled within few year of occurrence casualty loss usually have very long claim tail occasionally extending for decade casualty claim are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretation the legal environment further contributes to extending claim tail receivables are recorded with respect to loss ceded to other reinsurers and are estimated in manner similar to liability for insurance loss in addition reinsurance receivables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract reinsurance contract do not relieve the ceding company of it obligation to indemnify it own policyholder we utilize process and technique to establish liability estimate that are believed to best fit the particular business additional information regarding those process and technique of our significant insurance business geico general re and bhrg follows geico geico gross unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense liability of december were billion which included billion of reported average case and case development reserve and billion of ibnr reserve geico predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance auto insurance claim generally have relatively short claim tail the key assumption affecting our reserve estimate include projection of ultimate claim count frequency and average loss per claim severity our reserving methodology produce reserve estimate based upon the individual claim or ground up approach which yield an aggregate estimate of the ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense range of loss estimate are not determined in the aggregate our actuary establish and evaluate unpaid loss reserve using recognized standard actuarial loss development method and technique the significant reserve component and percentage of gross reserve of december are average reserve case and case development reserve and ibnr reserve each component of loss reserve is affected by the expected frequency and average severity of claim reserve are analyzed using statistical technique on historical claim data and adjusted when appropriate to reflect perceived change in loss pattern data is analyzed by policy coverage rated state reporting date and occurrence date among other way brief discussion of each reserve component follows we establish average reserve amount for reported auto damage claim and new liability claim prior to the development of an individual case reserve the average reserve are intended to represent reasonable estimate for incurred claim for claim when adjuster have insufficient time and information to make specific claim estimate and for large number of minor physical damage claim that are paid within relatively short time after being reported average reserve amount are driven by the estimated average severity per claim and the number of new claim opened our claim adjuster generally establish individual liability claim case loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimate soon the specific fact and merit of each claim can be evaluated case reserve represent the amount that in the judgment of the adjuster are reasonably expected to be paid in the future to completely settle the claim including expense individual case reserve are revised more information becomes known for most liability coverage case reserve alone are an insufficient measure of the ultimate cost due in part to the longer claim tail the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of fact available at the time the case reserve is established therefore we establish additional case development reserve estimate which are usually percentage of the case reserve of december case development reserve averaged approximately of total established case reserve in table of content management discussion continued property and casualty loss continued geico continued general case development factor are selected by retrospective analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case reserve case development factor are reviewed and revised periodically for unreported claim ibnr reserve estimate are calculated by first projecting the ultimate number of claim expected reported and unreported for each significant coverage by using historical quarterly and monthly claim count in order to develop age to age projection of the ultimate count by accident quarter reported claim are subtracted from the ultimate claim projection to produce an estimate of the number of unreported claim the number of unreported claim is multiplied by an estimate of the average cost per unreported claim to produce the ibnr reserve amount actuarial technique are difficult to apply reliably in certain situation such to new legal precedent class action suit or recent catastrophe consequently supplemental ibnr reserve for these type of event may be established through the collaborative effort of actuarial claim and other management personnel for each significant coverage we test the adequacy of the total loss reserve using one or more actuarial projection based on claim closure model paid loss triangle and incurred loss triangle each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claim occurring in given period and project the ultimate cost unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense estimate recorded at the end of developed downward by million when reevaluated through december producing corresponding increase to pre tax earnings in these downward reserve development represented approximately of earned premium in and approximately of prior year end recorded liability reserving assumption at december were modified appropriately to reflect the most recent frequency and severity result future reserve development will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or le than anticipated within the automobile line of business reserve for liability coverage are more uncertain due to the longer claim tail approximately of geico reserve of december were for automobile liability of which bodily injury bi coverage accounted for approximately we believe it is reasonably possible that the average bi severity will change by at least one percentage point from the severity used if actual bi severity change one percentage point from what wa used in establishing the reserve our reserve would develop up or down by approximately million resulting in corresponding decrease or increase in pre tax earnings many of the same economic force that would likely cause bi severity to be different from expected would likely also cause severity for other injury coverage to differ in the same direction geico exposure to highly uncertain loss is believed to be limited to certain commercial excess umbrella policy written during period from to remaining liability associated with such exposure are currently relatively insignificant component of geico total reserve approximately and there is minimal apparent asbestos or environmental liability exposure related claim activity over the past year wa insignificant general re and bhrg liability for unpaid property and casualty loss and loss adjustment expense of our general re and bhrg underwriting unit derive primarily from assumed reinsurance additional uncertainty are unique to the process used in estimating such reinsurance liability the nature extent timing and perceived reliability of information received from ceding company varies widely depending on the type of coverage the contractual reporting term which are affected by market condition and practice and other factor contract term and condition tend to lack standardization and contract term condition and coverage may evolve more rapidly than under primary insurance policy we are unable to reliably measure the ongoing economic impact of such uncertainty the nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative per occurrence excess or retroactive contract may not differ significantly from the information received under primary insurance contract this occurs when our personnel either work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claim or manages the claim themselves however loss information related to aggregate excess of loss contract including catastrophe loss and quota share treaty is often le detailed occasionally loss information is reported in summary format rather than on an individual claim basis loss data is usually provided through periodic report and may include the amount of ceded loss paid where reimbursement is sought well case loss reserve estimate ceding company infrequently provide ibnr estimate to reinsurers table of content management discussion continued property and casualty loss continued general re and bhrg continued each of our reinsurance business ha established practice to identify and gather needed information from client these practice include for example comparison of expected premium to reported premium to help identify delinquent client report and claim review to facilitate loss reporting and identify inaccurate or incomplete claim reporting we periodically evaluate and modify these practice condition risk factor and unanticipated area of exposure are identified the timing of claim reporting to reinsurers is typically delayed in comparison with claim reporting to primary insurer in some instance multiple reinsurers assume and cede part of an underlying risk thereby causing multiple contractual intermediary between and the primary insured in these instance the claim reporting delay are compounded the relative impact of reporting delay on the reinsurer varies depending on the type of coverage contractual reporting term and other factor contract covering casualty loss on per occurrence excess basis may experience longer delay in reporting due to the length of the claim tail regard to the underlying claim in addition ceding company may not report claim until they conclude it is reasonably possible that the reinsurer will be affected usually determined function of it estimate of the claim amount percentage of the reinsurance contract retention however the timing of reporting large per occurrence excess property loss or property catastrophe loss may not vary significantly from primary insurance under contract where periodic premium and claim report are required from ceding company such report are generally required at quarterly interval which in the range from to day after the end of the accounting period outside the reinsurance reporting practice vary in certain country client report annually often to day after the end of the annual period the different client reporting practice generally do not result in significant increase in risk or uncertainty the actuarial reserving methodology are adjusted to compensate for the delay premium and loss data is provided to through at least one intermediary the primary insurer so there is risk that the loss data provided is incomplete inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage term information provided by ceding company is reviewed for completeness and compliance with the contract term generally we are permitted under the contract to access the cedant book and record with respect to the subject business thus providing the ability to conduct audit to determine the accuracy and completeness of information audit are conducted we deem appropriate in the normal course of business dispute with client occasionally arise concerning whether certain claim are covered under our reinsurance policy we resolve most coverage dispute through the involvement of our claim department personnel and the appropriate client personnel or through independent outside counsel if dispute can not be resolved our contract generally specify whether arbitration litigation or alternative dispute resolution process will be invoked there are no coverage dispute at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have material impact on our consolidated result of operation or financial condition general re general re gross and net unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense and gross reserve by major line of business of december are summarized below amount are in million type line of business reported case reserve worker compensation ibnr reserve mass tort asbestos environmental gross reserve auto liability ceded reserve and deferred charge other casualty net reserve other general liability property total net of discount of million includes director and officer error and omission medical malpractice and umbrella coverage table of content management discussion continued property and casualty loss continued general re continued general re loss reserve estimation process is based upon ground up approach beginning with case estimate and supplemented by additional case reserve acrs and ibnr reserve the critical process in establishing loss reserve involve the establishment of acrs by claim examiner the determination of expected ultimate loss ratio which drive ibnr reserve amount and the comparison of case reserve reporting trend to the expected loss reporting pattern recorded reserve amount are subject to tail risk where reported loss develop beyond the maximum expected loss emergence time period we do not routinely determine loss reserve range we believe that the technique necessary to make such determination have not sufficiently developed and that the myriad of assumption required render such resulting range to be unreliable in addition claim count or average amount per claim are not utilized because client do not consistently provide reliable data in sufficient detail upon notification of reinsurance claim from ceding company our claim examiner make independent evaluation of loss amount in some case examiner estimate differ from amount reported by ceding company if the examiner estimate are significantly greater than the ceding company estimate the claim are further investigated if deemed appropriate acrs are established above the amount reported by the ceding company of december acrs aggregated approximately billion before discount and were concentrated in worker compensation reserve and to lesser extent in professional liability reserve our examiner also periodically conduct detailed claim review of individual client and case reserve are often increased result in we conducted claim review our actuary classify all loss and premium data into segment reserve cell primarily based on product treaty facultative and program and line of business auto liability property etc for each reserve cell premium and loss are aggregated by accident year policy year or underwriting year depending on client reporting practice and analyzed over time we internally refer to these loss aggregation loss triangle which serve the primary basis for our ibnr reserve calculation we review over reserve cell for our north american business and approximately reserve cell with respect to our international business we use loss triangle to determine the expected case loss emergence pattern for most coverage and in conjunction with expected loss ratio by accident year loss triangle are further used to determine ibnr reserve while additional calculation form the basis for estimating the expected loss emergence pattern the determination of the expected loss emergence pattern is not strictly mechanical process in instance where the historical loss data is insufficient we use estimation formula along with reliance on other loss triangle and judgment factor affecting our loss development triangle include but are not limited to the following change in client claim practice change in claim examiner use of acrs or the frequency of client company claim review change in policy term and coverage such client loss retention level and occurrence and aggregate policy limit change in loss trend and change in legal trend that result in unanticipated loss well other source of statistical variability collectively these factor influence the selection of the expected loss emergence pattern we select expected loss ratio by reserve cell by accident year based upon reviewing forecasted loss and indicated ultimate loss ratio that are predicted from aggregated pricing statistic indicated ultimate loss ratio are calculated using the selected loss emergence pattern reported loss and earned premium if the selected emergence pattern is not accurate then the indicated ultimate loss ratio may not be accurate which can affect the selected loss ratio and hence the ibnr reserve with selected loss emergence pattern selecting expected loss ratio is not strictly mechanical process and judgment is used in the analysis of indicated ultimate loss ratio and department pricing loss ratio we estimate ibnr reserve by reserve cell by accident year using the expected loss emergence pattern and the expected loss ratio the expected loss emergence pattern and expected loss ratio are the critical ibnr reserving assumption and are updated annually the annual ibnr reserve are determined our actuary calculate expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year these calculation do not involve new assumption and use the prior year end expected loss emergence pattern and expected loss ratio the expected loss are then allocated into interim estimate that are compared to actual reported loss in the subsequent year this comparison provides test of the adequacy of prior year end ibnr reserve and form the basis for possibly changing ibnr reserve assumption during the course of the year table of content management discussion continued property and casualty loss continued general re continued in our reported claim for prior year worker compensation loss were le than expected by million however further analysis of the worker compensation reserve cell by segment indicated the need for maintaining ibnr reserve these development precipitated net increase of million in nominal ibnr reserve estimate for unreported occurrence after adjusting for the million net increase in liability from change in net reserve discount during the year the net increase in worker compensation loss from prior year occurrence reduced pre tax earnings in by million to illustrate the sensitivity of change in expected loss emergence pattern and expected loss ratio for our significant excess of loss worker compensation reserve cell an increase of ten point in the tail of the expected emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratio would produce net increase in our nominal ibnr reserve of december of approximately million and million on discounted basis the increase in discounted reserve would produce corresponding decrease in pre tax earnings we believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and expected loss ratio to increase at these rate our other casualty and general liability reported loss excluding mass tort loss developed downward in relative to expectation casualty loss tend to be long tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in given year mean that loss reserve amount currently established will continue to develop favorably for our significant other casualty and general liability reserve cell including medical malpractice umbrella auto and general liability an increase of five point in the tail of the expected emergence pattern and an increase of five percent in expected loss ratio one percent for large international proportional reserve cell would produce net increase in our nominal ibnr reserve and corresponding reduction in pre tax earnings of approximately million we believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and expected loss ratio to increase at these rate in any of the individual aforementioned reserve cell however given the diversification in worldwide business more likely outcome are believed to be le than million overall our property loss were lower than expected in result of fewer catastrophe loss during the year our reported claim for prior year property loss were le than expected by million from december however the nature of property loss experience tends to be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophe and large individual property loss in certain reserve cell within excess director and officer and error and omission and coverage ibnr reserve are based on estimated ultimate loss without consideration of expected emergence pattern these cell often involve spike in loss activity arising from recent industry development making it difficult to select an expected loss emergence pattern for our large and reserve cell an increase of ten point in the tail of the expected emergence pattern for those cell where emergence pattern are considered and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratio would produce net increase in nominal ibnr reserve and corresponding reduction in pre tax earnings of approximately million we believe it is reasonably possible for the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and expected loss ratio to increase at these rate overall industry wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability such in setting the estimate for mass tort asbestos and hazardous waste collectively mass tort claim gross unpaid mass tort liability at december and were approximately billion at december and mass tort liability net of reinsurance were approximately billion mass tort net claim paid were million in in ultimate loss estimate for asbestos and environmental claim were increased by million in addition to the previously described methodology we consider survival ratio based on net claim payment in recent year versus net unpaid loss rough guide to reserve adequacy the survival ratio based on claim payment made over the last three year wa approximately year of december the reinsurance industry survival ratio for asbestos and pollution reserve wa approximately year based on the three year ending december estimating mass tort loss is very difficult due to the changing legal environment although such reserve are believed to be adequate significant reserve increase may be required in the future if new exposure or claimant are identified new claim are reported or new theory of liability emerge table of content management discussion continued property and casualty loss continued bhrg bhrg unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense of december are summarized follows amount are in million property casualty total reported case reserve ibnr reserve retroactive gross reserve deferred charge and ceded reserve net reserve in general the methodology we use to establish loss reserve vary widely and encompass many of the common methodology employed in the actuarial field today certain traditional methodology such paid and incurred loss development technique incurred and paid loss bornhuetter ferguson technique and frequency and severity technique are utilized well ground up technique where appropriate additional judgment must also be employed to consider change in contract condition and term well the incidence of litigation or legal and regulatory change of december our gross loss reserve related to retroactive reinsurance policy were predominately for casualty or liability loss our retroactive policy include excess of loss contract in which loss relating to loss event occurring before specified date on or before the contract date above contractual retention are indemnified or contract that indemnify all loss paid by the counterparty after the policy effective date we paid retroactive reinsurance loss and loss adjustment expense of approximately billion in the classification reported case reserve ha no practical analytical value with respect to retroactive policy since the amount is often derived from report in bulk from ceding company who may have inconsistent definition of case reserve we review and establish loss reserve estimate including estimate of ibnr reserve in the aggregate by contract in establishing retroactive reinsurance reserve we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment pattern and project loss into the future under various scenario the claim tail is expected to be very long for many policy and may last several decade we assign judgmental probability factor to these aggregate loss payment scenario and an expectancy outcome is determined we monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company report and other information concerning the underlying loss since the claim tail is expected to be very long for such contract we reassess expected ultimate loss significant event related to the underlying loss are reported or revealed during the monitoring and review process in change in retroactive reserve related to contract written in prior year were not significant bhrg liability for environmental asbestos and latent injury loss and loss adjustment expense were approximately billion at december and billion at december and were concentrated within retroactive reinsurance contract we paid loss in attributable to these exposure of approximately million bhrg reinsurer doe not receive consistently reliable information regarding asbestos environmental and latent injury claim from all ceding company particularly with respect to multi line treaty or aggregate excess of loss policy periodically we conduct ground up analysis of the underlying loss data of the reinsured to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured loss when detailed loss information is unavailable our estimate can only be developed by applying recent industry trend and projection to aggregate client data judgment in these area necessarily include the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which these claim will be adjudicated potential legal reform and legislation could also have significant impact on establishing loss reserve for mass tort claim in the future the maximum loss payable under our retroactive policy is not expected to exceed approximately billion of december which is based on aggregate contract limit applicable to most of the contract absent significant judicial or legislative change affecting asbestos environmental or latent injury exposure we currently believe it unlikely that gross unpaid loss of december billion will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than table of content management discussion continued property and casualty loss continued bhrg continued significant number of our reinsurance contract are expected to have low frequency of claim occurrence combined with potential for high severity of claim these include property loss from catastrophe and aviation risk under catastrophe and individual risk contract loss reserve related to catastrophe and individual risk contract were approximately billion at december decrease of about million from december in change in estimated loss for prior year event had an insignificant effect on pre tax earnings reserving technique for catastrophe and individual risk contract generally rely more on per policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development pattern of past loss catastrophe loss reserve are provided when it is probable that an insured loss ha occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated absent litigation affecting the interpretation of coverage term the expected claim tail is relatively short and thus the estimation error in the initial reserve estimate usually emerges within month after the loss event other reinsurance reserve amount are generally based upon loss estimate reported by ceding company and ibnr reserve that are primarily function of reported loss from ceding company and anticipated loss ratio established on an individual contract basis supplemented by management judgment of the impact on each contract of major catastrophe event they become known anticipated loss ratio are based upon management judgment considering the type of business covered analysis of each ceding company loss history and evaluation of that portion of the underlying contract underwritten by each ceding company which are in turn ceded to bhrg range of reserve amount result of change in underlying assumption is not prepared derivative contract liability our consolidated balance sheet include significant amount of derivative contract liability that are measured at fair value of december our most significant derivative contract exposure relate to equity index put option contract written between and these contract were entered into in over the counter market and certain element in the term and condition of such contract are not standard in particular we are not required to post collateral under most of our contract furthermore there is no source of independent data available to showing trading volume and actual price of completed transaction result the value of these liability are based on valuation model that are believed to be used by market participant such model or other valuation technique may use input that are observable in the marketplace while others are unobservable unobservable input require to make certain projection and assumption about the information that would be used by market participant in establishing price change in assumption may have significant effect on value we determine the estimated fair value of equity index put option contract using black scholes based option valuation model input to the model include the current index value strike price interest rate dividend rate and contract expiration date the weighted average interest and dividend rate used of december were and respectively and were approximately and respectively of december the interest rate of december and were approximately basis point and basis point on weighted average basis respectively over benchmark interest rate and represented our estimate of our nonperformance risk we believe however that the most significant economic risk under these contract relate to change in the index value component and to lesser degree to the foreign currency component the black scholes based model also incorporates volatility estimate that measure potential price change over time our contract have an average remaining maturity of about year the weighted average volatility used of december wa approximately compared to of december the weighted average volatility are based on the volatility input for each equity index put option contract weighted by the notional value of each equity index put option contract compared to the aggregate notional value of all equity index put option contract the volatility input for each equity index put option contract reflects our expectation of future price volatility the impact on fair value of december billion from change in the volatility assumption is summarized in the table that follows the value of contract in an table of content management discussion continued derivative contract liability continued actual exchange are affected by market condition and perception of the buyer and seller actual value in an exchange may differ significantly from the value produced by any mathematical model dollar are in million hypothetical change in volatility percentage point hypothetical fair value increase percentage point increase percentage point decrease percentage point decrease percentage point in addition we have exposure relating to number of credit default contract written involving corporate and state municipality issuer of december all credit default contract involving corporate issuer will expire in value associated with these contract are no longer significant the risk of loss are no longer significant our state municipality exposure begin to expire in the fair value of our state municipality issuer credit default contract are generally based on bond pricing data on the underlying bond issue and credit spread estimate we monitor and review pricing data and spread estimate for consistency well reasonableness with respect to current market condition we make no significant adjustment to the pricing data or input obtained price in current market trade involving identical or sufficiently similar risk and contract term our equity index put option or credit default contract could differ significantly from the fair value used in the financial statement we do not operate derivative dealer and currently do not utilize offsetting strategy to hedge these contract we intend to allow these contract to run off to their respective expiration date other critical accounting policy we record deferred charge with respect to liability assumed under retroactive reinsurance contract at the inception of these contract the deferred charge represent the excess if any of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid loss over the consideration received deferred charge are amortized using the interest method over an estimate of the ultimate claim payment period with the periodic amortization reflected in earnings component of loss and loss adjustment expense deferred charge balance are adjusted periodically to reflect new projection of the amount and timing of remaining loss payment adjustment to deferred charge balance resulting from change to these assumption are determined retrospectively from the inception of the contract unamortized deferred charge were approximately billion at december significant change in the estimated amount and payment timing of unpaid loss may have significant effect on unamortized deferred charge and the amount of periodic amortization our consolidated balance sheet of december includes goodwill of acquired business of billion which includes billion arising from our various acquisition in we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of such test include determining the estimated fair value of our reporting unit there are several method of estimating reporting unit fair value including market quotation underlying asset and liability fair value determination and other valuation technique such discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flow and multiple of earnings we primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow method the key assumption and input used in such method may include forecasting revenue and expense operating cash flow and capital expenditure well an appropriate discount rate and other input significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of reporting unit and performing goodwill impairment test due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flow and earnings actual future result may vary significantly from the forecast if the carrying amount of reporting unit including goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value then individual asset including identifiable intangible asset and liability of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of net asset would establish the implied value of goodwill the excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is then charged to earnings an impairment loss market risk disclosure our consolidated balance sheet include substantial amount of asset and liability whose fair value are subject to market risk our significant market risk are primarily associated with interest rate equity price foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price the fair value of our investment portfolio and equity index put option contract remain subject to considerable volatility the following section address the significant market risk associated with our business activity table of content management discussion continued interest rate risk we regularly invest in bond loan or other interest rate sensitive instrument our strategy is to acquire such security that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk management recognizes and accepts that loss may occur with respect to asset we also strive to maintain high credit rating so that the cost of our debt is minimized we rarely utilize derivative product such interest rate swap to manage interest rate risk the fair value of our fixed maturity investment and note payable and other borrowing will fluctuate in response to change in market interest rate in addition change in interest rate assumption used in our equity index put option contract model cause change in reported liability with respect to those contract increase and decrease in prevailing interest rate generally translate into decrease and increase in fair value of those instrument additionally fair value of interest rate sensitive instrument may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer prepayment option relative value of alternative investment the liquidity of the instrument and other general market condition the fair value of fixed interest rate instrument may be more sensitive to interest rate change than variable rate instrument the following table summarizes the estimated effect of hypothetical change in interest rate on our asset and liability that are subject to interest rate risk it is assumed that the interest rate change occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risk and that there are no significant change to other factor used to determine the value of the instrument the hypothetical change in interest rate do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenario variation in interest rate could produce significant change in the timing of repayment due to prepayment option available for these reason actual result might differ from those reflected in the table dollar are in million estimated fair value afterhypothetical change in

security strategically we strive to invest in business that posse excellent economics with able and honest management and at sensible price and table of content management discussion continued equity price risk continued prefer to invest meaningful amount in each investee consequently equity investment are concentrated in relatively few investees at december approximately of the total fair value of equity investment wa concentrated in five investees we often hold equity investment for long period of time so we are not troubled by short term price volatility with respect to our investment provided that the underlying business economic and management characteristic of the investees remain favorable we strive to maintain above average level of shareholder capital to provide margin of safety against short term price volatility market price for equity security are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value fluctuation in the market price of security may result from perceived change in the underlying economic characteristic of the investee the relative price of alternative investment and general market condition we are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contract while our ultimate potential loss with respect to these contract is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date fair value of these contract are also affected by change in other factor such interest rate expected dividend rate and the remaining duration of the contract these contract expire between and and may not be unilaterally settled before their respective expiration

price change primarily because of the natural hedging that occurs between asset and liability denominated in foreign currency in our consolidated financial statement in addition we hold investment in major multinational company that have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own such the coca cola company our net asset subject to translation are primarily in our insurance and utility and energy business and to lesser extent in our manufacturing and service business the translation impact is somewhat offset by transaction gain or loss on net reinsurance liability of certain subsidiary that are denominated in foreign currency well the equity index put option liability of subsidiary relating to contract that would be settled in foreign currency commodity price risk our diverse group of operating business use commodity in various way in manufacturing and providing service such we are subject to price risk related to various commodity in most instance we attempt to manage these risk through the pricing of our product and service to customer to the extent that we are unable to sustain price increase in response to commodity price increase our operating result will likely be adversely affected we utilize derivative contract to limited degree in managing commodity price risk most notably at midamerican midamerican exposure to commodity include variation in the price of fuel required to generate electricity wholesale electricity that is purchased and sold and natural gas supply for customer commodity price are subject to wide price swing supply and demand are impacted by among many other unpredictable item weather market liquidity generating facility availability customer usage storage and transmission and transportation constraint to mitigate portion of the risk midamerican us derivative instrument including forward future option swap and other agreement to effectively secure future supply or sell future production generally at fixed price the settled cost of these contract is generally recovered from customer in regulated rate financial result would be negatively impacted if the cost of wholesale electricity fuel or natural gas are higher than what is permitted to be recovered in rate midamerican also us future option and swap agreement to economically hedge gas and electric commodity price for physical delivery to non regulated

on non binding price indication obtained from third party source management reviewed these value relative to the term of the contract the current fact circumstance and market condition and concluded they were reasonable we did not adjust these price and therefore they have been excluded from the preceding table our other investment that are carried at fair value consist of few relatively large private placement transaction and include perpetual preferred stock and common stock warrant these investment are subject to contractual restriction on transferability and or provision that prevent from economically hedging our investment in applying discounted estimated cash flow technique in valuing the perpetual preferred stock we made assumption regarding the expected duration of the investment the issuer may have the right to redeem or convert these investment we also made estimate regarding the impact of subordination the preferred stock have lower priority in liquidation than the investment grade debt instrument of the issuer which affected the discount rate in valuing the common stock warrant we used warrant valuation model while most of the input to the model are observable we are subject to the aforementioned contractual restriction we have applied discount with respect to the contractual restriction increase or decrease to these input would result in decrease or increase to the fair value our equity index put option and credit default contract are not exchange traded and certain contract term are not standard in derivative market for example we are not required to post collateral under most of our contract and many contract have long duration and therefore are illiquid for these and other reason we classified these contract level the method we use to value these contract are those that we believe market participant would use in determining exchange price with respect to our contract we value equity index put option contract based on the black scholes option valuation model input to this model include current index price contract duration dividend and interest rate input which include berkshire non performance input which are observable however the valuation of long duration option is inherently subjective given the lack of observable transaction and price and acceptable value may be subject to wide range expected volatility input represent our expectation after considering the remaining duration of each contract and that the contract will remain outstanding until the expiration date without offsetting transaction occurring in the interim increase or decrease in the volatility input will produce increase or decrease in the fair value our state and municipality credit default contract value reflect credit spread contract duration interest rate bond price and other input believed to be used by market participant in estimating fair value we utilize discounted cash flow valuation model which incorporate the aforementioned input well our own estimate of credit spread for state and municipality where there is no observable input increase or decrease to the credit spread will produce
