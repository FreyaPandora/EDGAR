provider of prepaid service plan in the measured by customer our competitor include other national carrier such at inc at verizon communication inc verizon and sprint corporation sprint at and verizon are significantly larger than and may enjoy greater resource and scale advantage compared to in addition our competitor include numerous smaller regional carrier and mvnos such tracfone wireless inc many of which offer no contract prepaid service plan competitor also include provider who offer similar communication service such voice and messaging using alternative technology or service competitive factor within the wireless telecommunication industry include pricing market saturation service and product offering customer experience network investment and quality development and deployment of technology availability of additional spectrum license and regulatory change competitor have shown willingness to use aggressive pricing source of differentiation taken together the competitive factor we face continue to put pressure on margin company compete to retain the current customer base and continue to add new customer of contentsemployeesas of december we employed approximately full time and part time employee including network retail administrative and customer support function of which approximately employee were covered by collective bargaining agreement of december regulation the fcc regulates many key aspect of our business including licensing construction the operation and use of our network modification of our network control and ownership of our business the sale of certain business asset domestic roaming arrangement and interconnection agreement pursuant to it authority under the communication act of amended communication act the fcc ha number of complex requirement and proceeding that affect our operation and that could increase our cost or diminish our revenue for example the fcc ha rule regarding provision of and service porting telephone number interconnection roaming internet openness or net neutrality and the universal service and lifeline program many of these and other issue are considered in ongoing proceeding and we can not predict whether or how such action will affect our business financial condition or result of operation our ability to provide service and generate revenue could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or change to existing law and regulation in addition regulation of company that offer competing service can impact our business indirectly wireless communication provider must be licensed by the fcc to provide communication service at specified spectrum frequency within specified geographic area and must comply with the rule and policy governing the use of the spectrum adopted by the fcc the fcc issue each license for fixed period of time typically year in the case of cellular pc and point to point microwave license aws license have an initial term of year with successive year term thereafter while the fcc ha generally renewed license given to operating company like the fcc ha authority to both revoke license for cause and to deny license renewal if renewal is not in the public interest furthermore we could be subject to fine forfeiture and other penalty for failure to comply with fcc regulation even if any such non compliance wa unintentional in extreme case penalty can include revocation of our license the loss of any license or any related fine or forfeiture could adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition additionally congress and the fcc allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service cmrs which includes cellular pc and specialized mobile radio could significantly increase competition we can not ass the impact that any development that may occur in the economy or any future spectrum allocation by the fcc may have on license value fcc spectrum auction and other market development may adversely affect the market value of our license in the future significant decline in the value of our license could adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation in addition the fcc periodically review it policy on how to evaluate carrier spectrum holding change in these policy could affect spectrum resource and competition among and other carrier congress and the fcc have imposed limitation on foreign ownership of cmrs licensee that exceed direct ownership or indirect ownership the fcc ha ruled that higher level of indirect foreign ownership even up to are presumptively consistent with the public interest albeit subject to review consistent with that established policy the fcc ha issued declaratory ruling authorizing up to ownership of our company by deutsche telekom this declaratory ruling and our license are conditioned on deutsche telekom and the company compliance with network security agreement with the department of justice the federal bureau of investigation and the department of homeland security failure to comply with the term of this agreement could result in fine injunction and other penalty including potential revocation of our spectrum license while the communication act generally preempt state and local government from regulating the entry of or the rate charged by wireless communication provider certain state and local government regulate other term and condition of wireless service including billing termination of service arrangement and the imposition of early termination fee advertising network outage the use of handset while driving zoning and land use further the fcc and the federal aviation administration regulate the siting lighting and construction of transmitter tower and antenna tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning well federal statute regarding environmental and historic preservation the future cost to comply with all relevant regulation are to some extent unknown and regulation could result in higher operating expense in the future of contentsavailable informationt mobile form and all other report and amendment filed with or furnished to the sec are

carefully in evaluating mobile our business financial condition liquidity or result of operation well the price of our common stock and other security could be materially adversely affected by any of these risk risk related to our business and the wireless industrythe scarcity and cost of additional wireless spectrum and regulation relating to spectrum use may adversely affect our business strategy and financial planning we will need to acquire additional spectrum in order to continue our customer growth expand into new metropolitan area maintain our quality of service meet increasing customer demand and deploy new technology we will be at competitive disadvantage and possibly experience erosion in the quality of service in certain market if we fail to gain access to necessary spectrum reaching capacity especially low band spectrum the continued interest in and aggregation of spectrum may reduce our ability to acquire spectrum from other carrier or otherwise negatively impact our ability to gain access to spectrum through other mean result we may need to acquire spectrum through government auction and or enter into spectrum sharing arrangement which are subject to certain risk and uncertainty although the fcc ha scheduled an auction of low band spectrum to begin in it is possible the auction may be delayed any material delay could adversely impact our ability to implement our plan and effort to improve our network additionally we may be unable to secure the spectrum we need in the upcoming auction or in any other government auction we may elect to participate in on favorable term or at all in addition the fcc ha encountered resistance to it plan to make additional spectrum available which ha created uncertainty about the timing and availability of spectrum through government auction the fcc may impose condition on the use of new wireless broadband mobile spectrum including new restriction or rule governing the use or access to current or future spectrum this could increase pressure on capacity additional condition that may be imposed by the fcc include heightened build out requirement limited renewal right clearing obligation or open access or net neutrality requirement that may make it le attractive or le economical to acquire spectrum in addition rule may be established for future government spectrum auction that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configuration or coverage area if we can not acquire needed spectrum from the government or otherwise if competitor acquire spectrum that will allow them to provide service competitive with our service or if we can not deploy service over acquired spectrum on timely basis without burdensome condition at reasonable cost and while maintaining network quality level then our ability to attract and retain customer and our associated financial performance could be materially adversely affected of contentswe operate in competitive wireless industry which could limit our ability to attract and retain customer and adversely affect our business operation and financial result we have multiple wireless competitor in each of our service area some of which have greater resource than and compete for customer based principally on service device offering price call quality data use experience coverage area and customer service in addition we are facing growing competition from provider offering service using alternative wireless technology and ip based network well traditional cable satellite tv and wireline network we expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industry customer growth rate to be moderate in comparison with historical growth rate or possibly negative leading to increased competition for customer customer attrition also known churn may increase the wireless industry shift away from service contract we also expect that our customer growing appetite for data service will place increased demand on our network capacity this competition and our capacity issue will continue to put pressure on pricing and margin company compete for potential customer our ability to compete will depend on among other thing continued absolute and relative improvement in network quality and customer service effective marketing and selling of product and service attractive pricing and cost management all of which will involve significant expense joint venture merger acquisition and strategic alliance in the wireless industry have resulted in and are expected to result in larger competitor competing for limited number of customer the two largest national wireless communication provider currently serve significant percentage of all wireless customer and hold significant spectrum and other resource our largest competitor may be able to enter into exclusive handset device or content arrangement execute pervasive advertising and marketing campaign or otherwise improve their cost position relative to in addition the refusal of our large competitor to provide critical access to resource and input such roaming service on reasonable term may improve their position within the wireless broadband mobile service industry furthermore industry are converging video mobile and broadband company compete to deliver content the next generation of offering company like comcast and at directv will have the scale and asset to aggressively compete in converged wireless industry these factor together with the effect of the increasing aggregate penetration of wireless service in all metropolitan area and the ability of our larger competitor to use resource to build out their network and to quickly deploy advanced technology have made it more difficult for smaller carrier like to continue to attract and retain customer and may adversely affect our competitive position and ability to grow which would have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result if we are unable to take advantage of technological development on timely basis then we may experience decline in demand for our service or face challenge in implementing or evolving our business strategy in order to grow and remain competitive with new and evolving technology in our industry we will need to adapt to future change in technology continually invest in our network enhance our existing offering and introduce new offering to address our current and potential customer changing demand enhancing our network is subject to risk from equipment change and migration of customer from existing spectrum band adopting new and sophisticated technology may result in implementation issue such scheduling and supplier delay unexpected or increased cost technological constraint regulatory permitting issue subscriber dissatisfaction and other issue that could cause delay in launching new technological capability which in turn could result in significant cost or reduce the anticipated benefit of the upgrade in general the development of new service in the wireless telecommunication industry will require to anticipate and respond to the continuously changing demand of our customer which we may not be able to do accurately or timely we could experience material adverse effect on our business operation financial position and operating result if our new service fail to retain or gain acceptance in the marketplace or if cost associated with these service are higher than anticipated if our effort or those of third party service provider to maintain the privacy and security of our customer confidential or sensitive information are not successful at preventing significant data breach or cyber attack we could incur substantial additional cost become subject to litigation enforcement action or regulatory investigation and suffer reputational damage our business like that of most retailer and wireless company involves the

third party service provider have been subject to cyber attack in the past including breach at experian in september in which subset of record containing current and potential customer information wa compromised although we regularly review our process and procedure to protect against unauthorized access to or use of sensitive data and to prevent data loss the ever evolving threat landscape requires to continually evaluate and adapt our system and process we can not assure that the security measure and preventive action we take will be adequate to repel significant attack prevent information security breach or the misuse of data unauthorized access by third party or employee or exploit against third party supplier environment if we are subject to such attack or compromise we may incur significant cost be subject to regulatory investigation sanction and private litigation experience disruption to our operation or may suffer damage to our reputation that negatively impact customer confidence although the cyber attack that we and our third party service provider have been subjected to in the past have not caused significant harm to our company future cyber attack may materially adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition we are in the process of transferring our customer billing system from our existing third party vendor to new third party vendor any unanticipated difficulty disruption or significant delay could have adverse operational financial and reputational effect on our business we are currently implementing new customer billing system which involves moving to new third party billing service vendor and platform through utilization of phased deployment approach the first release phase which is limited to prepaid service is scheduled for post implementation we plan to operate both the existing and new billing system in parallel to aid in the transition to the new system until all phase of the conversion are complete the implementation may cause major system or business disruption or we may fail to implement the new billing system in timely or effective manner in addition the third party billing service vendor may experience error cyber attack or other operational disruption that could negatively impact and over which we may have limited control interruption and or failure of this new billing service system could disrupt our operation and impact our ability to provide or bill for our service retain customer attract new customer or negatively impact overall customer experience any occurrence of the foregoing could cause material adverse effect on our operation and financial condition material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and reputational damage our reputation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by system failure business disruption and unauthorized use of or interference with our network and other system to be successful we must provide our customer with reliable trustworthy service and protect the communication location and personal information shared or generated by our customer we rely upon our system and network and the system and network of other provider and supplier to provide and support our service and in some case to protect our customer and our information failure of our or others system network and

terrorist attack and act of war theft of customer and or proprietary information offered for sale for competitive advantage or corporate extortion unauthorized access to our information technology billing customer care and provisioning system and network and those of our supplier and other provider supplier failure or delay and other system failure or outage such event could cause to lose customer lose revenue incur expense suffer reputational and goodwill damage and subject to litigation or governmental investigation remediation cost could include liability for information loss repairing infrastructure and system and or cost of incentive offered to customer our insurance may not cover or be adequate to fully reimburse for cost and loss associated with such event of contentswe rely on third party to provide specialized product or service for the operation of our business and failure or inability by such party to provide these product or service could adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition we depend heavily on supplier and other third party in order for to efficiently operate our business our business is complex and it is not unusual for multiple vendor located in multiple location to help to develop maintain and troubleshoot product and service such network component software development service and billing and customer service support our supplier often provide service outside of the which carry associated additional regulatory and legal obligation we generally rely upon the supplier to provide contractual assurance and accurate information regarding risk associated with their provision of product or service in accordance with our expectation and standard and they may fail to do generally there are multiple source for the type of product and service we purchase or use however we currently rely on limited number of supplier for billing service voice and data communication transport service network infrastructure equipment handset and other device and payment processing service among other product and service we rely on disruption with respect to such supplier or failure of such supplier to adequately perform could have material adverse on our financial performance in the past our supplier contractor and third party retailer have not always performed at the level we expect or at the level required by their contract our business could be severely disrupted if key supplier contractor service provider or third party retailer fail to comply with their contract or become unable to continue the supply due to patent or other intellectual property infringement action or other disruption our business could also be disrupted if we experience delay or service degradation during any transition to new outsourcing provider or other supplier or we were required to replace the supplied product or service with those from another source especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice any such disruption could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition economic and market condition may adversely affect our business and financial performance well our access to financing on favorable term or at all our business and financial performance are sensitive to change in general economic condition including interest rate consumer credit condition consumer debt level consumer confidence rate of inflation or concern about deflation unemployment rate economic growth energy cost and other macro economic factor difficult or worsening general economic condition could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation market volatility economic uncertainty and weak economic condition may materially adversely affect our business and financial performance in number of way our service are available to broad customer base significant segment of which may be more vulnerable to weak economic condition we may have greater difficulty in gaining new customer within this segment and existing customer may be more likely to terminate service due to an inability to pay weak economic condition and credit condition may also adversely impact our supplier and dealer some of which have filed for or may be considering bankruptcy or may experience cash flow or liquidity problem or are unable to obtain or refinance credit such that they may no longer be able to operate any of these could adversely impact our ability to distribute market or sell our product and service in addition instability in the global financial market could lead to periodic volatility in the credit equity and fixed income market this volatility could limit our access to the credit market leading to higher borrowing cost or in some case the inability to obtain financing on term that are acceptable to or at all the agreement governing our indebtedness include restrictive covenant that limit our operating flexibility the agreement governing our indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restriction on these restriction subject in certain case to customary basket exception and

management underlying estimate of useful life evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset for impairmentwe ass the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset spectrum license for potential impairment annually of december or more frequently if event or change in circumstance indicate that asset might be impaired we may elect to first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is le than it carrying amount basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test if we do not perform qualitative assessment or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is le than it carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment based on two step test in the first step we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying value the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using market approach which is based on market capitalization we recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor change in market capitalization to determine whether decline if any necessitate an interim impairment review in the event market capitalization doe decline below it book value we will consider the length severity and reason for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists including considering whether control premium should be added to the market capitalization we believe short term fluctuation in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value prior to the business combination we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flow approach due to the absence of comparable observable market data the discounted cash flow method utilizes future cash flow assumption based on estimate of revenue ebitda margin and long term growth rate taking into consideration expected industry and market condition the cash flow are then discounted using weighted average cost of capital reflecting the risk associated with the business and the projected cash flow if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value the second step of the test is performed of contentsin the second step we determine the fair value of all of the asset and liability of the reporting unit including those that currently may not be recorded the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the sum of the fair value of all of those asset and liability represents the implied goodwill amount if the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than the carrying amount of goodwill then an impairment loss is recognized for the difference we test spectrum license for impairment on an aggregate basis consistent with the management of the overall business at national level we may elect to first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset group is le than it carrying value if we do not perform the qualitative assessment or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset group is le than it carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group if the carrying amount of spectrum license exceeds the fair value an impairment loss is recognized we estimate the fair value of the spectrum license using the greenfield approach which is an income approach that estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participant at the measurement date under current market condition the greenfield approach value the spectrum license by calculating the cash flow generating potential of hypothetical start up company that go into business with no asset except the asset to be valued in this case spectrum license the value of the spectrum license can be considered equal to the present value of the cash flow of this hypothetical start up company we base the assumption underlying the greenfield approach on combination of market participant data and our historical result trend and business plan future cash flow in the greenfield approach are based on estimate and assumption of market participant revenue ebitda margin network build out period and long term growth rate for market participant the cash flow are discounted using weighted average cost of capital the valuation approach utilized to estimate fair value for the purpose of the impairment test of goodwill and spectrum license require the use of assumption and estimate which involve degree of uncertainty if actual result or future expectation are not consistent with the assumption this may result in the recording of significant impairment charge on goodwill or spectrum license the most significant assumption within the valuation model are the discount rate revenue ebitda margin and the long term growth rate see note summary of significant accounting policy and note goodwill spectrum license and other intangible asset of the note to the consolidated

rent expense most of the lease on our tower site have fixed rent escalation which provide for periodic increase in the amount of rent payable over time we calculate straight line rent expense for each of these lease based on the fixed non cancellable term of the lease plus all period if any for which failure to renew the lease imposes penalty on in such amount that renewal appears at lease inception or significant modification to be reasonably assured we make significant assumption at lease inception in determining and assessing the factor that constitute penalty in doing so we primarily consider cost incurred in acquiring and developing new site the useful life of site improvement and equipment cost future economic condition and the extent to which improvement in wireless technology can be incorporated into current assessment of whether an economic compulsion will exist in the future to renew lease income taxeswe recognize deferred tax asset and liability based on temporary difference between the financial statement and tax basis of asset and liability using enacted tax rate expected to be in effect when these difference are realized valuation allowance of contentsis maintained against deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction within the carryforward period available we consider many factor when determining whether valuation allowance is needed including recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction expectation of future income the carryforward period available for tax reporting purpose and other relevant factor we account for uncertainty in income tax recognized in the financial statement in accordance with the accounting guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return we ass whether it is more likely than not that tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the

to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date the three tier hierarchy for input used in measuring fair value which prioritizes the input based on the observability of the measurement date is follows level price in active market for identical asset or liability level input other than the quoted price in active market for identical asset and liability andlevel input for which there is little or no market data which require mobile to develop assumption of market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability asset and liability are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the company assessment of the significance of
