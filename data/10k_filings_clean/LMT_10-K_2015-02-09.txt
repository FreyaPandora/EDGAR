financial condition and result of operation and note information on business segment of our consolidated financial statement competition our broad portfolio of product and service competes both domestically and internationally the product and service of other large aerospace defense and information technology company well numerous smaller competitor particularly in certain of our service business we often form team with our competitor in effort to provide our customer with the best mix of capability to address specific requirement in area of our business customer requirement are changing to encourage expanded competition such information technology contract there may be wide range of small to large contractor bidding on procurement additionally information technology procurement are increasingly focusing on price other factor of competition principal factor of competition include the value of our product and service to the customer technical and management capability the ability to develop and implement complex integrated system architecture total cost of ownership our demonstrated ability to execute and perform against contract requirement and our ability to provide timely solution table of content the competition for international sale is generally subject to government stipulation export restriction market access technology transfer industrial cooperation and contracting practice we may compete against and non company or team for contract award by international government international competition also may be subject to different law or contracting practice of international government that may affect we structure our bid for the procurement in many international procurement the purchasing government relationship with the and it industrial cooperation program are also important factor in determining the outcome of competition is common for international customer to require contractor to comply with industrial cooperation regulation sometimes referred to offset requirement and we have entered into foreign offset agreement part of securing some international business for information concerning offset agreement see contractual commitment and balance sheet arrangement in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation patent we routinely apply for and substantial number of and international patent related to the product and service we provide in addition to owning large portfolio of intellectual property we also license intellectual property to and from third party the government ha license in our patent that are developed in performance of government contract and it may use or authorize others to use the invention covered by our patent for government purpose unpatented research development and engineering skill also make an important contribution to our business although our intellectual property right in the aggregate are important to the operation of our business we not believe that any existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that it loss or termination would have material adverse effect on our business taken whole raw material and seasonality certain of our product require relatively scarce raw material historically we have been successful in obtaining the raw material and other supply needed in our manufacturing process we seek to manage raw material supply risk through long term contract and by maintaining stock of key material in inventory aluminum and titanium are important raw material used in certain of our aeronautics and space system program long term agreement have helped enable continued supply of aluminum and titanium carbon fiber is an important ingredient in composite material used in our aeronautics program such the aircraft aluminum lithium which we use for aircraft structural component is currently only available from limited source we have been advised by some supplier that pricing and the timing of availability of material in some commodity market fluctuate widely these fluctuation may negatively affect the price and availability of certain material while we do not anticipate material problem regarding the supply of our raw material and believe that we have taken appropriate measure to mitigate these variation if key material become unavailable or if pricing fluctuates widely in the future it could result in delay of one or more of our program increased cost or reduced operating profit no material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal various factor can affect the distribution of our sale accounting period including the timing of government award the availability of government funding product delivery and customer acceptance government contract and regulation our business is heavily regulated we contract with numerous government agency and entity including all branch of the military the department of defense homeland security justice commerce health and human service transportation and energy the postal service the social security administration the federal aviation administration nasa the environmental protection agency and veteran affair similar government authority exist in other country and regulate our international effort we must comply with and are affected by law and regulation relating to the formation

type of contract negotiation impose specific and unique cost accounting practice that may differ from generally accepted accounting principle impose acquisition regulation which may change or be replaced over time that define allowable and unallowable cost and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost based government contract table of content require specific security

performance if contract is terminated for convenience we generally are protected by provision covering reimbursement for cost incurred on the contract and profit on cost if contract is terminated for default we generally are entitled to payment for our work that ha been accepted by the government however the government could make claim to reduce the contract value or recover it procurement cost

business is classified by the government and can not be specifically described the operating result of these classified contract are included in our consolidated financial statement the business risk associated with classified contract historically have not differed materially from those of our other government contract our internal control addressing the financial reporting of classified contract are consistent with our internal control for our non classified contract our operation are subject to and affected by various federal state local and foreign environmental protection law and regulation regarding the discharge of material into the environment or otherwise regulating the protection of the environment while the extent of our financial exposure can not in all case be reasonably estimated the cost of environmental compliance have not had and we do not expect that these cost will have material adverse effect on our earnings financial position and cash flow primarily most of our environmental cost are allowable in establishing the price of our product and service under our contract with the government for information regarding these matter including current

an investment in our common stock or debt security involves risk and uncertainty we seek to identify manage and mitigate risk to our business risk and uncertainty can not be eliminated or necessarily predicted you should carefully consider the following factor in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form deciding to purchase our common stock or debt security table of content we depend heavily on contract with the government we derived of our consolidated net sale from the government in including from the department of defense we expect to continue to derive most of our sale from work performed under government contract those contract are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriation congress usually appropriates fund on fiscal year basis even though contract performance may extend over many year consequently contract are often partially funded initially and additional fund are committed only congress make appropriation if we incur cost in excess of fund obligated on contract we may be at risk for reimbursement of those cost unless and additional fund are obligated to the contract the program in which we participate must compete with other program and policy imperative for consideration during the budget and appropriation process concern about increased deficit spending along with ongoing economic challenge continue to place pressure on government budget while we believe that our program are well aligned with national defense and other priority shift in the and international spending and tax policy change in security defense and intelligence priority the affordability of our product and service general economic condition and development and other factor may affect decision to fund or the level of funding for existing or proposed program discussed within the industry consideration in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation the government continues to face significant deficit reduction pressure and it is likely that discretionary spending by the government will remain constrained for number of year under such condition large or complex program which consist of multiple contract and phase are potentially subject to increased scrutiny our largest program the represented of our total consolidated net sale in and is expected to represent higher percentage of our sale in future year decision to cut spending or reduce planned order could have an adverse impact on our result of operation for more information regarding the program see status of the program in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation based upon our diverse range of defense homeland security and information technology product and service we believe that this make it le likely that cut in any specific contract or program will have long term effect on our business however termination of multiple or large program or contract could adversely affect our business and future financial performance we could incur expense beyond those that would be reimbursed if one or more of our existing contract were terminated for convenience due to lack of funding or other reason potential change in funding priority may afford new or additional opportunity for our business in term of existing follow on or replacement program while we would expect to compete and be well positioned the incumbent on existing program we may not be successful or the replacement program may be funded at lower level generally we expect that the impact of budget reduction on our operating result will lag in certain of our business with longer cycle such our aeronautics and space system business segment and in our product business within our missile and fire control mfc and mission system and training mst business segment due to our production contract backlog however our business with smaller short term contract are the most susceptible to the impact of budget reduction such our information system global solution is business segment and certain service business within our mfc and mst business segment we have also experienced increased market pressure in these service business including lower in theater support troop level are drawn down and increased re competition on existing contract coupled with the fragmentation of large contract into multiple smaller contract that are awarded primarily on the basis of price additionally our service business across most of our business segment have experienced lower volume due to improved product field performance that require le service support on december the government passed the government fiscal year gfy omnibus spending bill to finance most federal activity through september the end of it current fiscal year after operating under continuing resolution temporary funding measure from october to december currently the department of homeland security remains funded through continuing resolution until february the omnibus spending bill provides for revised defense spending limit of billion for gfy and eliminates much of the uncertainty and inefficiency in procuring product and service under the continuing resolution under continuing resolution partial year funding is available at prior year level subject to certain restriction but new spending initiative are not authorized in year the government not complete it budget process before the end of it fiscal year government operation typically are funded through continuing resolution that authorizes agency of the government to continue to operate but doe not authorize new spending initiative when the government operates under continuing resolution delay can occur in contract award due to lack of funding historically this ha not had material effect on our business should continuing resolution be used to fund government operation after gfy or decision regarding sequestration remain pending table of content it may cause additional government contract award to be delayed canceled or funded at lower level and cause our result of operation to vary between period in some circumstance we may continue to work without funding and use our fund in order to meet our customer desired delivery date for product or service such fund could be at risk if the government doe not provide authorization and additional funding to our program we are subject to number of procurement law and regulation our business and our reputation could be adversely affected if we fail to comply with these law we must comply with and are affected by law and regulation relating to the award administration and performance of government contract government contract law and regulation affect how we do business with our customer and impose certain risk and cost on our business violation of specific law and regulation could harm our reputation and result in the imposition of fine and penalty the termination of our contract suspension or debarment from bidding on or being awarded contract loss of our ability to export product or service and civil or criminal investigation or proceeding in some instance these law and regulation impose term or right that are different from those typically found in commercial transaction for example the government may terminate any of our government contract and subcontract either at it convenience or for default based on our performance upon termination for convenience of fixed price type contract we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered item reimbursement for allowable cost for work in process and an allowance for profit on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in loss upon termination for convenience of cost reimbursable contract we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable cost plus portion of the fee allowable cost would include our cost to terminate agreement with our supplier and subcontractor the amount of the fee recovered if any is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation we attempt to ensure that adequate fund are available by notifying the customer when it estimated cost including those associated with possible termination for convenience approach level specified being allotted to it program fund are typically appropriated on fiscal year basis and the cost of termination for convenience may exceed the cost of continuing program in given fiscal year occasionally program do not have sufficient fund appropriated to cover the termination cost were the government to terminate them for convenience under such circumstance the government could assert that it is not required to appropriate additional funding termination arising of our default may expose to liability and have material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contract and order in addition on those contract for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor the government could terminate prime contract under which we are subcontractor notwithstanding the quality of our service subcontractor in the case of termination for default the government could make claim to reduce the contract value or recover it procurement cost and could ass other special penalty however under such circumstance we have right and remedial action under law and the federal acquisition regulation far in addition certain of our government contract span one or more base year and multiple option year the government generally ha the right not to exercise option period and may not exercise an option period for various reason however the government may exercise option period even for contract for which it is expected that our cost may exceed the contract price or ceiling government agency including the defense contract audit agency the defense contract management agency and various agency inspector general routinely audit and investigate government contractor these agency review contractor performance under it contract it cost structure it business system and compliance with applicable law regulation and standard any cost found to be misclassified may be subject to repayment we have unaudited and or unsettled incurred cost claim related to past year which place risk on our ability to issue final billing on contract for which authorized and appropriated fund may be expiring certain deficiency identified during government audit of contractor business system may result in the government withholding payment on our billing such deficiency have not impacted our internal control over financial reporting withholding payment on billing are capped at of billing when deficiency impact single business system and when deficiency impact multiple system such withholding are typically reduced to after the contractor corrective action plan ha been accepted and progress to implement the corrective action ha been demonstrated and are withdrawn upon satisfactory completion and verification of the corrective action plan table of content if an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activity we may be subject to civil or criminal penalty and administrative sanction including reduction of the value of contract contract modification or termination forfeiture of profit suspension of payment penalty fine and suspension or prohibition from business with the government in addition we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegation of impropriety were made against similar government oversight exists in most other country where we conduct business our profitability and cash flow may vary based on the mix of our contract and program our performance our ability to control cost and evolving government procurement policy our profitability and cash flow may vary materially depending on the type of long term government contract undertaken the nature of the product produced or service performed under those contract the cost incurred in performing the work the achievement of other performance objective and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fee is determined particularly under award and incentive fee contract our backlog includes variety of contract type which are intended to address changing risk and reward profile program matures contract type include cost reimbursable fixed price incentive fee fixed price and time and material contract contract for development program with complex design and technical challenge are typically cost reimbursable under cost reimbursable contract we are reimbursed for allowable cost and paid fee which may be fixed or performance based in these case the associated financial risk primarily relate to reduction in fee and the program could be cancelled if cost schedule or technical performance issue arise other contract in backlog are for the transition from development to production low rate initial production lrip contract which includes the challenge of starting and stabilizing manufacturing production and test line while the final design is being validated these generally are cost reimbursable or fixed price incentive fee contract under fixed price incentive fee contract the allowable cost incurred are eligible for reimbursement but are subject to cost share arrangement which affect profitability generally if our cost exceed the contract target cost or are not allowable under the applicable regulation we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all cost and may have our fee reduced or eliminated there are also contract for production well operation and maintenance of the delivered product that have the challenge of achieving stable production and delivery rate while maintaining operability of the product after delivery these contract are mainly fixed price although some operation and maintenance contract are time and material type under fixed price contract we receive fixed price regardless of the actual cost we incur we have to absorb any cost in excess of the fixed price under time and material contract we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rate and for certain expense the failure to perform to customer expectation and contract requirement may result in reduced fee or loss and affect our financial performance in that period under each type of contract if we are unable to control cost our operating result could be adversely affected particularly if we are unable to justify an increase in contract value to our customer cost overrun or the failure to perform on existing program also may adversely affect our ability to retain existing program and win future contract award the government is currently pursuing and implementing policy that could negatively impact our profitability change in procurement policy favoring more incentive based fee arrangement different award fee criterion or government contract negotiation offer that indicate our cost should be may affect the predictability of our profit rate our customer are subject to pressure that may result in change in contract type referenced above earlier in program maturity is traditional an example of this is the use of fixed price incentive fee contract for recent lrip contract on the program while the development contract is being performed concurrently our customer also may pursue non traditional contract provision in negotiation of contract for example change resulting from the development contract may need to be implemented on the production contract concept referred to concurrency which may require to pay for portion of the concurrency cost an example of customer budget pressure includes the government requiring that bid and proposal cost be included in general and administrative cost rather than charged directly to contract in certain circumstance other policy could negatively impact our working capital and cash flow for example the government ha expressed preference for requiring progress payment rather than performance based payment on new fixed price contract which if implemented delay our ability to recover significant amount of cost incurred on contract and thus affect the timing of our cash flow table of content increased competition and bid protest in budget constrained environment may make it more difficult to maintain our financial performance and customer relationship we are facing increased competition particularly in information technology and cyber security at our is business segment from non traditional competitor outside of the aerospace and defense industry in addition to our customer determining to source work internally rather than hiring contractor at the time our customer are facing budget constraint trying to do more with le by cutting cost identifying more affordable solution and reducing product development cycle we have also experienced increased market pressure in our service business due to the fragmentation of large contract into multiple smaller contract that are awarded primarily on the basis of price it is critical we maintain strong customer relationship and seek to understand the priority of their requirement in this price competitive environment in international sale we face substantial competition from both manufacturer and international manufacturer whose government sometimes provide research and development assistance marketing subsidy and other assistance for their product additionally our competitor are also focusing on increasing their international sale to partially mitigate the effect of reduced government budget to remain competitive we consistently must maintain strong customer relationship and provide superior performance advanced technology solution and service at an affordable cost and with the agility that our customer require to satisfy their mission objective leader in defense and global security we have large number of program for which we are the incumbent contractor substantial portion of our business is awarded through competitive bidding the government increasingly ha relied upon competitive contract award type including indefinite delivery indefinite quantity gsa schedule and other multi award contract which ha the potential to create pricing pressure and increase our cost by requiring that we submit multiple bid and proposal in addition multi award contract require that we make sustained effort to obtain task order under the contract the competitive bidding process entail substantial cost and managerial time to prepare bid and proposal for contract that may not be awarded to or may be split among competitor following award we may encounter significant expense delay contract modification or bid protest from unsuccessful bidder on new program award unsuccessful bidder are more frequently protesting in the hope of being awarded subcontract for portion of the work in return for withdrawing the protest bid protest could result in significant expense to contract modification or even loss of the contract award even where bid protest doe not result in the loss of contract award the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin and therefore delay our recognizing sale we are the prime contractor on most of our contract and if our subcontractor supplier or teaming agreement or venture partner fail to perform their obligation our performance and our ability to win future business could be harmed for most of our contract we rely on other company to provide material major component and product and to perform portion of the service that we provide to our customer such arrangement may involve subcontract teaming arrangement venture or supply agreement with other company upon which we rely contracting party there is risk that we may have dispute with our contracting party including dispute regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed the workshare provided to that party customer concern about the other party performance our failure to extend existing task order or issue new task order or our hiring of the personnel of subcontractor teammate or venture partner or vice versa in addition change in the economic environment including defense budget and constraint on available financing may adversely affect the financial stability of our contracting party and their ability to meet their performance requirement or to provide needed supply on timely basis failure for whatever reason by one or more of our contracting party to provide the agreed upon supply or perform the agreed upon service on timely basis may affect our ability to perform our obligation and require that we transition the work to other company for example on february one of our supplier experienced fire in it factory which produce propeller for our aircraft that supplier is the sole source of these propeller we are working with that supplier to ass whether the supplier will be able to meet it commitment to and the potential disruption if it is not contracting party performance deficiency may affect our operating result and could result in customer terminating our contract for default or convenience default termination could expose to liability and affect our ability to compete for future contract and order additionally our effort to increase the efficiency of our operation and improve the affordability of our product and service could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain supplier international sale may pose different risk in of our net sale were from international customer we have strategy to grow international sale over the next several year inclusive of sale of aircraft to our international partner and other country international sale are subject to numerous political and economic factor regulatory requirement significant competition and other risk associated with doing business in foreign country our exposure to such risk may increase if our international sale grow we anticipate table of content our international business is conducted through foreign military sale fm contracted through the government or direct commercial sale dc with international customer in approximately half of our sale to international customer were fm while the other

frequently have term le favorable to than the far export and import tax and currency risk also may be increased for dc with international customer while these risk are potentially greater than those encountered in our business the pricing of our product and service is commensurate with the risk profile on dc with international customer our international business is highly sensitive to change in regulation political environment or security risk that may affect our ability to conduct business outside of the including those regarding investment procurement taxation and repatriation of earnings our international business also may be impacted by change in foreign national priority foreign government budget and global economic condition and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate sale of military product are also affected by defense budget and foreign policy additionally the timing of order from our international customer can be le predictable than for our customer and may lead to fluctuation in the amount reported each year for our international sale in conjunction with defense procurement some international customer require contractor to comply with industrial cooperation regulation including entering into industrial cooperation agreement sometimes referred to offset agreement offset agreement may require in country purchase technology transfer local manufacturing support investment in foreign joint venture and financial support project an incentive or condition to contract award in some country these offset agreement may require the establishment of venture

funding of our plan and recovery of cost on our contract described also may be subject to change caused by legislative or regulatory action we have taken certain action over the last year to mitigate the volatility the plan may have on our cash flow and earnings including amendment made in june to certain of our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plan for non union employee to freeze future retirement benefit however the impact of these action may be le than anticipated or may be offset by other pension cost increase due to factor such change in actuarial assumption with regard to cash flow in the past few year we have made substantial cash contribution to our plan in excess of the amount required by the employee retirement income security act of erisa amended by the pension protection act of ppa we generally are able to recover these contribution related to our plan allowable cost on our government contract including fm but there is lag between when we contribute cash to our plan under pension funding rule and recover it under government cost accounting standard ca effective february the ca rule were revised to harmonize the measurement and period assignment of the pension cost allocable to government contract with the ppa ca harmonization in the cost impact of ca harmonization started being phased in with the goal of better aligning the ca pension cost and erisa funding requirement being fully achieved in the enactment of the highway and transportation funding act of increased the interest rate assumption used to determine our ca pension cost which

successful in hiring or retaining personnel with the requisite skill or clearance we increasingly compete with commercial technology company outside of the aerospace and defense industry for qualified technical cyber and scientific position the number of qualified domestic engineer is decreasing and the number of cyber professional is not keeping with demand to the extent that these company grow at faster rate or face fewer cost and product pricing constraint they may be able to offer more attractive compensation and other benefit to candidate or our existing employee to the extent that the

unsuccessful in those effort we could incur additional cost and experience work stoppage union action at supplier can also affect any delay or work stoppage could adversely affect our ability to perform under our contract which could negatively impact our result of operation cash flow and financial condition our estimate and projection may prove to be inaccurate the accounting for some of our most significant activity is based on judgment and estimate which are complex and subject to many variable for example accounting for sale using the percentage of completion method requires that we ass risk and make assumption regarding schedule cost technical and performance issue for each of our thousand of contract many of which are long term in nature another example is the billion of goodwill asset recorded on our balance sheet of december from previous acquisition that were made over time which represent greater than of our total asset and are subject to annual impairment testing and more frequent testing upon the occurrence of certain event or significant change in circumstance that indicate goodwill may be impaired if we experience change or factor arise that negatively affect the expected cash flow of reporting unit we may be required to write off all or portion of the reporting unit related goodwill asset change in or foreign tax law including possibly with retroactive effect and audit by tax authority could result in unanticipated increase in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flow for example proposal to lower the corporate income tax rate would require to reduce our net deferred tax asset upon enactment of the related tax legislation with corresponding material one time increase to income tax expense but our income tax expense and

global security and continuing economic pressure in the and globally significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our product and service and placing security capability quickly into the hand of our and international customer at affordable price recognizing that our customer are resource constrained we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in disciplined manner with focus on adjacent market close to our core capability well growing our international sale we continue to focus on affordability initiative we also expect to continue to invest in technology to fulfill new mission requirement for our customer and invest in our people so that we have the technical skill necessary to succeed without limiting our ability to return substantially all of our free cash to our investor in the form of dividend and share repurchase over the next three year we expect net sale will decline in the low single digit range from level we continue to see downward pressure from the effect of government budget reduction primarily in our service business we expect our segment operating profit will decline in the mid to high single digit range from level due to an expected decrease in segment operating profit at all five business segment accordingly we expect segment operating profit margin will be below the level in the to range our outlook for assumes the government continues to support and fund our key program consistent with the government fiscal year gfy budget change in circumstance may require to revise our assumption which could materially change our current estimate of net sale and operating profit margin for additional information related to trend in net sale and operating profit at our business segment see the business segment result of operation section below industry consideration government funding constraint the government our principal customer continues to face significant fiscal and economic challenge such financial deficit budget uncertainty increasing debt level and an economy with restrained growth to address these challenge the government continues to focus on discretionary spending entitlement program tax and other initiative to stimulate the economy create job and reduce the deficit in doing so the administration and congress must balance decision regarding defense homeland security and other federal spending priority in constrained fiscal environment largely imposed by the budget control act of budget control act the budget control act established limit on discretionary spending which provided for reduction to planned defense spending of billion over year period that began with gfy government fiscal year start on october and end on september the budget control act also provided for additional automatic spending reduction known sequestration which went into effect on march that would have reduced planned defense spending by an additional billion over nine year period that began in gfy in december the government enacted the bipartisan budget act of bipartisan budget act which increased the limit on discretionary spending for gfy among other fiscal change although the bipartisan budget we define free cash flow cash from operation determined under generally accepted accounting principle gaap le capital expenditure presented on our statement of cash flow table of content act allows for more certainty in the budget planning process for gfy it retained sequestration cut for gfys through including the across the board spending reduction methodology provided for in the budget control act result there remains uncertainty regarding how sequestration cut beyond gfy will be applied the dod and other agency may have significantly le flexibility in how to apply budget cut in future year while the defense budget sustained the largest single reduction under the budget control act other civil agency and program have also been impacted by significant spending reduction in light of the budget control act and deficit reduction pressure it is likely that discretionary spending by the government will remain constrained for number of year on december the government passed the gfy omnibus spending bill to finance most federal activity through september the end of it current fiscal year after operating under continuing resolution temporary funding measure from october to december currently the department of homeland security remains funded through continuing resolution until february the omnibus spending bill provides for revised defense spending limit of billion for gfy and eliminated much of the uncertainty and inefficiency in procuring product and service under the continuing resolution under continuing resolution partial year funding is available at prior year level subject to certain restriction but new spending initiative are not authorized on february the president submitted budget proposal for gfy which included billion for defense spending about billion more than the spending limit under the budget control act the budget also provides for billion in additional war spending we anticipate there will continue to be significant debate within the government over defense spending throughout the budget process for gfy and beyond the outcome of these debate could have long term consequence for our industry and company described below however we continue to believe that our portfolio of product and service will continue to be well supported in strategically focused allocation of budget resource potential impact of budget reduction while recent budget action provide more measured and strategic approach to addressing the government fiscal challenge sequestration remains long term concern if not further modified sequestration could have significant negative impact on our industry and company in future period there may be disruption of ongoing program impact to our supply chain contractual action including partial or complete termination potential facility closure and thousand of personnel reduction across the industry that will severely impact advanced manufacturing operation and engineering expertise and accelerate the loss of skill and knowledge sequestration or other budgetary cut in lieu of sequestration could have material negative effect on our company despite the continued uncertainty surrounding government budget the investment and acquisition we have made in recent year have sought to align our business with what we believe are the most critical national priority and mission area additionally we are seeking to lessen our dependence on contract with the government by focusing on expanding into adjacent market close to our core capability and growing international sale but we may not be successful in this strategy the possibility remains however that our program could be materially reduced extended or terminated result of the government continuing assessment of priority change in government priority or budget reduction including sequestration particularly in those circumstance where sequestration is implemented across the board without regard to national priority additionally decrease in production volume associated with budget cut including sequestration will increase unit cost making our product le affordable for both our and international customer in particular sequestration may also result in significant rescheduling or termination activity with our supplier base such activity could result in claim from our supplier which may include the amount established in any settlement agreement the cost of evaluating the supplier settlement proposal and the cost of negotiating settlement agreement budget cut including sequestration could result in restructuring charge impairment of asset including goodwill or other charge we expect cost associated with claim from our supplier and restructuring charge will be recovered from our customer generally we expect that the impact of budget reduction on our operating result will lag in certain of our business with longer cycle such our aeronautics and space system business segment and our product business within our mfc and mst business segment due to our production contract backlog however our business with smaller short term contract are the most susceptible to the impact of budget reduction such our is business segment and certain service business within our mfc and mst business segment we have also experienced increased market pressure in these service business including lower in theater support troop level are drawn down and increased re competition on existing contract coupled with the fragmentation of large contract into multiple smaller contract that are awarded primarily on the basis of price additionally our service business across most of our business segment have experienced lower volume due to improved product field performance that require le service support table of content other business consideration international business key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sale to accomplish this growth we continue to focus on expanding our in country presence and strengthening our relationship internationally through partnership and local production joint technology office since we have acquired amor group united kingdom based company and we have opened new in country office including israel united kingdom the united arab emirate uae and saudi arabia that will enable development of partnership to create product and enhance our offering in technology aerospace and security sector we conduct business with international customer primarily through our aeronautics mfc and mst business segment in our aeronautics business segment there remains strong international interest in the program the program includes commitment from eight international partner country and three international customer well expression of interest from other country the government and the eight partner country continue to work together on the design testing production and sustainment of the the international role on the program is growing we installed the autonomic logistics information system central point of entry kit at the final assembly and checkout facility in italy we also delivered the first two australian aircraft in the number of aircraft for international customer in recent low rate initial production lrip contract continues to increase with the recent lrip contract including aircraft order for israel and japan other area of international expansion at our aeronautics business segment include the and program the award from iraq in for additional aircraft extends production into also we delivered super hercules aircraft to various international customer in our mfc business segment produce the patriot advanced capability pac and terminal high altitude area defense thaad air and missile defense system which continue to generate significant international interest the pac is an advanced missile defense system designed to intercept incoming airborne threat during we received an award to provide pac missile defense equipment to qatar other international customer include japan germany the netherlands taiwan kuwait and the uae other country in the middle east and the asia pacific region have also expressed interest in our air and missile defense system additionally we continue to see international demand for our tactical missile and fire control product in our mst business segment we continue to experience international interest in the aegis ballistic missile defense system we perform activity in the development production ship integration and test and lifetime support for ship of international customer such japan spain korea and australia we have an ongoing program in canada for combat system equipment upgrade on halifax class frigate in our training and logistics solution portfolio we have active program and pursuit in united kingdom saudi arabia canada singapore qatar and australia also we integrate mission avionics on the mh program for australia and denmark status of the program the program consists of development contract and multiple production contract including sustainment activity the development contract is being performed concurrent with the production contract concurrent performance of development and production contract is used for complex program to test aircraft shorten the time to field system and achieve overall cost saving we expect the development portion of the program will be substantially complete in with le significant effort continuing into production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many year given the government current inventory objective of aircraft for the air force marine corp and navy commitment from our eight international partner and three international customer well expression of interest from other country the government continues to complete various operational test including ship trial mission system evaluation and weapon testing with the aircraft fleet recently surpassing flight hour in november the government successfully completed testing of the carrier variant at sea aboard the us nimitz progress continues to be made on the production of aircraft of december we have delivered production aircraft to our and international partner including delivery of the final lrip contract aircraft and have production aircraft in backlog including order from our international partner table of content given the size and complexity of the program we anticipate that there will be continual review related to aircraft performance program schedule cost and requirement part of the dod congressional and international partner oversight and budgeting process current program challenge include but are not limited to supplier and partner performance software development level of cost associated with life cycle operation and sustainment and warranty receiving funding for production contract on timely basis executing future flight test finding resulting from testing and operating the aircraft portfolio shaping activity we continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of product and service to meet the current and future need of our customer we accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activity and through acquisition divestiture and internal realignment activity internal realignments are designed to more fully leverage existing capability and enhance development and delivery of product and service we selectively pursue the acquisition of business and investment at attractive valuation that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customer or technology we have made number of niche acquisition of business and

and not by type or amount of operating expense consequently our discussion of business segment performance focus on net sale and operating profit consistent with our approach for managing the business this approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contract management ass the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sale and operating profit and monitor performance on our contract in similar manner through their completion table of content we regularly provide customer with report of our cost the contract progress the cost information in the report is accumulated in manner specified by the requirement of each contract for example cost data provided to customer for product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product such wing box on an aircraft and for service would align to the type of work being performed such help desk support our contract generally are cost based which allows for the recovery of cost in the pricing of our product and service most of our contract are bid and negotiated with our customer under circumstance in which we are required to disclose our estimated total cost to provide the product or service this approach for negotiating contract with our government customer generally allows for the recovery of our cost we also may enter into long term supply contract for certain material or component to coincide with the production schedule of certain product and to ensure their availability at known unit price many of our contract span several year and include highly complex technical requirement at the outset of contract we identify and monitor risk to the achievement of the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract and ass the effect of those risk on our estimate of total cost to complete the contract the estimate consider the technical requirement newly developed product versus mature product the schedule and associated task the number and type of milestone event and cost material labor subcontractor overhead and the estimated cost to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreement required under certain contract with international customer the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risk surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirement schedule and cost in the initial estimated total cost to complete the contract profit booking rate may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risk surrounding the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract which decrease the estimated total cost to complete the contract conversely our profit booking rate may decrease if the estimated total cost to complete the contract increase all of the estimate are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate we have number of program that are designated classified by the government which can not be specifically described the operating result of these classified program are included in our consolidated and business segment result and are subjected to the same oversight and internal control our other program our net sale are primarily derived from long term contract for product and service provided to the government well fm contracted through the government we account for these contract well product contract with non government customer using the percentage of completion method of accounting which represent substantially all of our net sale we derive our remaining net sale from contract to provide service to non government customer which we account for under the service method of accounting under the percentage of completion method of accounting we record sale on contract based upon our progress towards completion on particular contract well our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion cost reimbursable contract provide for the payment of allowable cost plus fee for fixed priced contract net sale and cost of sale are recognized product are delivered or cost are incurred due to the nature of the percentage of completion method of accounting change in our cost of sale are typically accompanied by related change in our net sale change in net sale and operating profit generally are expressed in term of volume change in volume refer to increase or decrease in sale or operating profit resulting from varying

take advantage of new business opportunity when they arise consistent with that strategy we have continued to invest in our business including capital expenditure independent research and development and made selective business acquisition while returning cash to stockholder through dividend and share repurchase and managing our debt level maturity and interest rate we have generated strong operating cash flow which have been the primary source of funding for our operation capital expenditure acquisition debt service and repayment dividend share repurchase and postretirement benefit plan contribution our strong operating cash flow enabled our board of director to approve two key cash deployment initiative in september first we increased our quarterly dividend rate by to per share second the board of director approved billion increase to our share repurchase program inclusive of this increase the total remaining authorization for future common share repurchase under our program wa billion of december further based on our current cash projection in october we announced new cash deployment initiative in which we plan to reduce our total outstanding share count to below million share over the next three year market condition and our fiduciary obligation permitting we have accessed the capital market on limited occasion needed or when opportunistic we expect our cash from operation will continue to be sufficient to support our operation and anticipated capital expenditure for the foreseeable future mentioned in the capital resource section below we have financing resource available to fund potential cash outflow that are le predictable or more discretionary should they occur we also have access to credit market if needed for liquidity or general corporate purpose including but not limited to our revolving credit facility or the ability to issue commercial paper and letter of credit to support customer advance payment and for other trade finance purpose such guaranteeing our performance on particular contract cash received from customer either from the payment of invoice for work performed or for advance in excess of cost incurred is our primary source of cash we generally do not begin work on contract until funding is appropriated by the customer billing timetable and payment term on our contract vary based on number of factor including the contract type we generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost reimbursable and time and material contract which together represent approximately half of the sale we recorded in we are authorized to bill the cost are incurred or work is performed number of our fixed price contract may provide for performance based payment which allow to bill and collect cash we perform on the contract the amount of performance based payment and the related milestone are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract the timing of such payment may differ from our incurrence of cost related to our contract performance thereby affecting our cash flow the government ha indicated that it would consider progress payment the baseline for negotiating payment term on fixed price contract rather than performance based payment in contrast to negotiated performance based table of content payment term progress payment provision correspond to percentage of the amount of cost incurred during the performance of the contract while the total amount of cash collected on contract is the same performance based payment have had more favorable impact on the timing of our cash flow in addition our cash flow may be affected if the government decides to withhold payment on our billing while the impact of withholding payment delay the receipt of cash the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract will not vary the majority of our capital expenditure for and those planned for are for equipment facility infrastructure and information technology expenditure for equipment and facility infrastructure are generally incurred to support new and existing program across all of our business segment for example we have project underway in our aeronautics business segment for facility and equipment to support higher production of the combat aircraft in addition we have project underway to modernize certain of our facility inclusive of our effort to consolidate and reduce

the type amount and maturity of our indebtedness we may at time refinance existing indebtedness vary our mix of variable rate and fixed rate debt or seek alternative financing source for our cash and operational need our stockholder equity wa billion at december decrease of billion from december the decrease wa due to the re measurement of our postretirement benefit plan of billion primarily due

the preceding table include approximately billion related to contractual commitment entered into result of contract we have with our government customer the government generally would be required to pay for any cost we incur relative to these commitment if they were to terminate the related contract for convenience under the federal acquisition regulation far subject to available funding this also would be true in case where we perform subcontract work for prime contractor under government contract the termination for convenience language also may be included in contract with foreign state and local government we also have contract with customer that do not include termination for convenience provision including contract with commercial customer table of content purchase obligation in the preceding table for capital expenditure generally include facility infrastructure equipment and information technology we also may enter into industrial cooperation agreement sometimes referred to offset agreement condition to obtaining order for our product and service from certain customer in foreign country these agreement are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country offset agreement may be satisfied through activity that do not require to use cash including transferring technology providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in country project and the purchase by third party our vendor of supply from in country vendor these agreement also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activity purchasing supply from in country vendor providing financial support for in country project establishment of venture with local company and building or leasing facility for in country operation we typically do not commit to offset agreement until order for our product or service are definitive the amount ultimately applied against our offset agreement are based on negotiation with the customer and typically require cash outlay that represent only fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement the cost to satisfy our offset obligation are included in the estimate of our total cost to complete the contract and may impact our profitability and cash flow the ability to recover investment that we make are generally dependent upon the successful operation of venture that we do not control and may involve product and service that are dissimilar to our business activity at december the remaining obligation under our outstanding offset agreement totaled billion which primarily relate to our aeronautics mfc and mst business segment some of which extend through to the extent we have entered into purchase obligation at december that also satisfy offset agreement those amount are included in the preceding table offset program usually extend over several year and may provide for penalty estimated at approximately billion at december in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirement while historically we have not been required to pay material penalty resolution of offset requirement are often the result of negotiation and subjective judgment in connection with our ownership interest of ula we and the boeing company boeing have each received distribution from ula including distribution of million that we and boeing have each received since ula formation in december which are subject to agreement between boeing and ula whereby if ula doe not have sufficient cash resource or credit capacity to make required payment under the inventory supply agreement it ha with boeing both we and boeing would provide to ula in the form of an additional capital contribution the level of funding required for ula to make those payment any such capital contribution would not exceed the amount of the distribution subject to the agreement based on current expectation of ula cash flow need we currently believe that ula should have sufficient operating cash flow and credit capacity including access to it million revolving credit agreement from third party financial institution to meet it obligation such that we would not be required to make contribution under these agreement in addition both we and boeing have cross indemnified each other for guarantee by and boeing of the performance and financial obligation of ula under certain launch service contract we believe ula will be able to fully perform it obligation it ha done through december and that it will not be necessary to make payment under the cross indemnity or guarantee we have entered into standby letter of credit surety bond and third party guarantee with financial institution and other third party primarily relating to advance received from customer and the guarantee of future performance on certain contract letter of credit and surety bond generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform in some case we may guarantee the contractual performance of third party such venture partner at december we had the following outstanding letter of credit surety bond and third party guarantee in million commitment expiration by

category are expected to renew for additional period until completion of the contractual obligation table of content at december third party guarantee totaled million of which approximately related to guarantee of contractual performance of venture to which we currently are or previously were party this amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non performance of the venture partner in addition we generally have cross indemnity in place that may enable to recover amount that may be paid on behalf of venture partner we believe our current and former venture partner will be able to perform their obligation they have done through december and that it will not be necessary to make payment under the guarantee in determining our exposure we evaluate the reputation technical capability and credit quality of our current and former venture partner critical accounting policy contract accounting sale recognition substantially all of our net sale are accounted for using the percentage of completion method which requires that significant estimate and assumption be made in accounting for the contract our remaining net sale are derived from contract to provide service to non government customer which we account for under service accounting model we evaluate new or significantly modified contract with customer other than the government to the extent the contract include multiple element to determine if the individual deliverable should be accounted for separate unit of accounting when we determine that accounting for the deliverable separate unit is appropriate we allocate the contract value to the deliverable based on their relative estimated selling price the contract or contract modification we evaluate for multiple element typically are long term in nature and include the provision of both product and service based on the nature of our business we generally account for component of such contract using the percentage of completion accounting model or the service accounting model appropriate we classify net sale product or service on our statement of earnings based on the predominant attribute of the underlying contract most of our long term contract are denominated in dollar including contract for sale of military product and service to international government contracted through the government we record sale for both product and service under cost reimbursable fixed price and time and material contract contract type cost reimbursable contract cost reimbursable contract which accounted for about of our total net sale in and of our total net sale in and provide for the payment of allowable cost incurred during performance of the contract plus fee up to ceiling based on the amount that ha been funded we generate revenue under two general type of cost reimbursable contract cost plus award fee incentive fee which represent substantial majority of our cost reimbursable contract and cost plus fixed fee contract cost plus award fee contract provide for an award fee that varies within specified limit based on the customer assessment of our performance against predetermined set of criterion such target based on cost quality technical and schedule criterion cost plus incentive fee contract provide for reimbursement of cost plus fee which is adjusted by formula based on the relationship of total allowable cost to total target cost incentive based on cost or reimbursement of cost plus an incentive to exceed stated performance target incentive based on performance the fixed fee in cost plus fixed fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed fee doe not vary with actual cost fixed price and other contract under fixed price contract which accounted for about of our total net sale in and of our total net sale in and we agree to perform the specified work for pre determined price to the extent our actual cost vary from the estimate upon which the price wa negotiated we will generate more or le profit or could incur loss some fixed price contract have performance based component under which we may earn incentive payment or incur financial penalty based on our performance under time and material contract which accounted for about of our total net sale in and we are paid fixed hourly rate for each direct labor hour expended and we are reimbursed for allowable material cost and allowable out of pocket expense to the extent our actual direct labor and associated cost vary in relation to the fixed hourly billing rate provided in the contract we will generate more or le profit or could incur loss table of content percentage of completion method of accounting we record net sale and an estimated profit on percentage of completion basis for cost reimbursable and fixed price contract for product and service contract with the government the percentage of completion method for product contract depends on the nature of the product provided under the contract for example for contract that require to perform significant level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract and or to deliver minimal quantity sale are recorded using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion under the cost to cost method we recognize sale and an estimated profit cost are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred cost bear to total estimated cost for contract that require to provide substantial number of similar item without significant level of development we record sale and an estimated profit on percentage of completion basis using unit of delivery the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract for contract to provide service to the government sale are generally recorded using the cost to cost method award and incentive fee well penalty related to contract performance are considered in estimating sale and profit rate on contract accounted for under the percentage of completion method estimate of award fee are based on past experience and anticipated performance we record incentive or penalty when there is sufficient information to ass anticipated contract performance incentive provision that increase or decrease earnings based solely on single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs accounting for contract using the percentage of completion method requires judgment relative to assessing risk estimating contract sale and cost including estimating award and incentive fee and penalty related to performance and making assumption for schedule and technical issue due to the number of year it may take to complete many of our contract and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contract the estimation of total sale and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variable and accordingly is subject to change when adjustment in estimated total contract sale or estimated total cost are required any change from prior estimate are recognized in the current period for the inception to date effect of such change our estimate of cost at completion of the contract are based on assumption we make for variable such labor productivity and availability the complexity of the work to be performed the availability of material the length of time to complete the contract to estimate increase in wage and price for material performance by our subcontractor and the availability and timing of funding from our customer among other variable when estimate of total cost to be incurred on contract exceed total estimate of sale to be earned provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined many of our contract span several year and include highly complex technical requirement at the outset of contract we identify and monitor risk to the achievement of the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract and ass the effect of those risk on our estimate of total cost to complete the contract the estimate consider the technical requirement newly developed product versus mature product the schedule and associated task the number and type of milestone event and cost material labor subcontractor overhead and the estimated cost to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreement sometimes referred to offset agreement required under certain contract with international customer the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risk surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirement schedule and cost in the initial estimated total cost to complete the contract profit booking rate may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risk surrounding the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract which decrease the estimated total cost to complete the contract conversely our profit booking rate may decrease if the estimated total cost to complete the contract increase all of the estimate are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate in addition comparability of our segment sale operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by change in profit booking rate on our contract accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting increase in the profit booking rate typically referred to risk retirement usually relate to revision in the estimated total cost that reflect improved condition on particular contract conversely condition on particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated total cost to complete and reduction in the profit booking rate increase or decrease in profit booking rate are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception to date effect of such change segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other item favorable item may include the positive resolution of contractual matter cost recovery on restructuring charge and insurance recovery unfavorable item may include the adverse resolution of contractual matter certain asset impairment table of content restructuring charge except for significant severance action mentioned above which are excluded from segment operating result and reserve for dispute segment operating profit and item such risk retirement reduction of profit booking rate or other matter are presented net of state income tax service method of accounting under fixed price service contract we are paid predetermined fixed amount for specified scope of work and generally have full responsibility for the cost associated with the contract and the resulting profit or loss we record net sale under fixed price service contract to non government customer on straight line basis over the period of contract performance unless evidence suggests that net sale are earned or the obligation are fulfilled in different pattern for cost reimbursable contract for service to non government customer that provide for award and incentive fee we record net sale service are performed exclusive of award and incentive fee award and incentive fee are recorded when they are fixed or determinable generally at the date the amount is communicated to by the customer this approach result in the recognition of such fee at contractual interval typically every six month throughout the contract and is dependent on the customer process for notification of award and issuance of formal notification cost for all service contract are expensed incurred other contract accounting consideration the majority of our sale are driven by pricing based on cost incurred to produce product or perform service under contract with the government cost based pricing is determined under the far the far provides guidance on the type of cost that are allowable in establishing price for good and service under government contract for example cost such those related to charitable contribution interest expense and certain advertising and public relation activity are unallowable and therefore not recoverable through sale in addition we may enter into advance agreement with the government that address the subject of allowability and allocability of cost to contract for specific matter for example most of the environmental cost we incur for environmental remediation related to site operated in prior year are allocated to our current operation general and administrative cost under far provision and supporting advance agreement reached with the government we closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policy related to contract accounting cost incurred and allocated to contract are reviewed for compliance with government regulation by our personnel and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency postretirement benefit plan overview many of our employee participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plan retiree medical and life insurance plan and other postemployment plan collectively postretirement benefit plan see note the majority of our accrued benefit obligation relate to our qualified defined benefit pension plan and retiree medical and life insurance plan we recognize on plan by plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plan under gaap either an asset or liability on our balance sheet there is corresponding non cash adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax benefit recorded deferred tax asset in stockholder equity the gaap funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan asset and the benefit obligation of the plan the gaap benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefit we currently expect to pay to plan participant based on past service in june we amended certain of our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plan for non union employee to freeze future retirement benefit the freeze will take effect in two stage beginning on january the pay based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefit will be frozen so that future pay increase annual incentive bonus or other amount earned for or related to period after december will not be used to calculate retirement benefit on january the service based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefit will also be frozen so that participant will no longer earn further credited service for any period after december when the freeze is complete the majority of our salaried employee will have transitioned to an enhanced defined contribution retirement saving plan result of these plan amendment we were required to re measure the asset and benefit obligation for the affected defined benefit pension plan in june we also elected to re measure the asset and benefit obligation of substantially table of content all other defined benefit pension plan in june to align the measurement date across substantially all of our defined benefit pension plan result of the re measurement in june we recorded net increase of billion to our qualified defined benefit pension obligation and net increase of million to our nonqualified defined benefit pension obligation which combined resulted in corresponding increase of million to other comprehensive loss during net of million of tax benefit additionally in recent year we have taken other action to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plan on our financial result including no longer offering defined benefit pension plan to non union represented employee hired after december and negotiating similar change with various labor organization such that new union represented employee do not participate in our defined benefit pension plan further during lump sum settlement payment of million were made from the defined benefit pension trust to certain former employee who had not commenced receiving their vested benefit payment and the corresponding benefit obligation wa reduced by million notwithstanding these action the impact of these plan and benefit on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plan may materially change from year to year because those calculation are sensitive to funding level well change in several key economic assumption including interest rate rate of return on plan asset and other actuarial assumption including participant longevity estimate expected rate of increase in future compensation level through december for our non union plan and employee turnover well the timing of cash funding actuarial assumption the plan asset and benefit obligation are measured at the end of each year or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain event such plan amendment described above settlement or curtailment the amount we record are measured using actuarial valuation which are dependent upon key assumption such discount rate employee turnover participant longevity the expected rate of increase in future compensation level through december for our non union plan the expected long term rate of return on plan asset and the health care cost trend rate for our retiree medical plan the assumption we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligation of the measurement date and the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in subsequent period when reassessing these assumption we consider past and current market condition and make judgment about future market trend we also consider factor such the timing and amount of expected contribution to the plan and benefit payment to plan participant we utilized discount rate of when calculating our benefit obligation related to our defined benefit pension plan at december compared to at december and at december we utilized discount rate of when calculating our benefit obligation related to our retiree medical plan at december compared to at december and at december we evaluate several data point in order to arrive at an appropriate discount rate including result from cash flow model quoted rate from long term bond index and change in long term bond rate over the past year part of our evaluation we calculate the approximate average yield on corporate bond rated aa or better selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flow longevity assumption are used to estimate the life expectancy of plan participant during which they are expected to receive benefit payment recent actuarial study indicate life expectancy are longer and would have the resultant effect of increasing the total expected benefit payment to plan participant our benefit obligation at december reflect the new longevity assumption which had the effect of increasing the qualified defined benefit pension benefit obligation by billion we utilized an expected long term rate of return on plan asset of at december consistent with the rate used at december and december the long term rate of return assumption represents the expected long term rate of return on the fund invested or to be invested to provide for the benefit included in the benefit obligation this assumption is based on several factor including historical market index return the anticipated long term allocation of plan asset the historical return data for the trust fund plan expense and the potential to outperform market index return the difference between the long term rate of return on plan asset assumption we select and the actual return on plan asset in any given year affect both the funded status of our benefit plan and the calculation of fa pension expense in subsequent period although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption the average expected return over long term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption result change in this assumption are le frequent than change in the discount rate our stockholder equity ha been reduced cumulatively by billion from the annual year end measurement of the funded status of postretirement benefit plan inclusive of the billion for the remeasurement the cumulative non table of content cash after tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial loss resulting from decline in discount rate from at the end of to at the end of and investment loss incurred during which will be amortized to expense over the average future service period of employee expected to receive benefit under the plan of approximately year during million of these amount wa recognized component of postretirement benefit plan expense and about million is expected to be recognized expense in the discount rate and long term rate of return on plan asset assumption we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimate and judgment change of plus or minus basis point in the discount rate assumption at december with all other assumption held constant would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of by approximately billion which would result in an after tax increase or decrease in stockholder equity at the end of the year of approximately billion if the discount rate at december that wa used to compute the expected fa pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plan had been basis point higher or lower with all other assumption held constant the amount of fa pension expense projected for would be lower or higher by approximately million if the expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumption at december that wa used to compute the expected fa pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plan had been basis point higher or lower with all other assumption held constant the amount of fa pension expense projected for would be lower or higher by approximately million funding consideration we made contribution related to our qualified defined benefit pension plan of billion in billion in and billion in inclusive of amount in excess of our required contribution funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plan is determined in manner consistent with ca and in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of erisa amended by the pension protection act of ppa our goal ha been to fund the pension plan to level of at least determined under the ppa this erisa funded status is calculated on different basis than under gaap in july the government passed the moving ahead for progress in the century act of map which included provision that changed the methodology for calculating the interest rate assumption used in determining the minimum funding requirement under the ppa result of map there wa an increase in the interest rate assumption which in turn lowered the minimum funding requirement the impact of map decreased each year and wa scheduled to phase out by on august the hatfa wa enacted which extends the methodology put in place by map to calculate the interest rate assumption so that the impact will begin to decrease in and phase out by accordingly the hatfa ha the effect of lowering our minimum funding requirement during the affected period from what they otherwise would have been had the map methodology not been extended the erisa funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plan wa about and of december and the gaap funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plan wa about and funded at december and contribution to our defined benefit pension plan are recovered over time through the pricing of our product and service on government contract including fm and are recognized in our cost of sale and net sale ca govern the extent to which our pension cost are allocable to and recoverable under contract with the government including fm we recovered billion in both and and billion in ca pension cost effective february ca rule were revised to better align the recovery of pension cost including prepayment credit on government contract with the minimum funding requirement of the ppa referred to ca harmonization specifically ca harmonization shortened the amortization period for allocating gain and loss to government contract from to year and requires the use of an interest rate to determine ca pension cost consistent with the interest rate used to determine minimum pension funding requirement under the ppa while the change in the amortization period wa applicable beginning in there is transition period for the impact of the change in the ca liability measurement due to the revised interest rate that will be phased in with the full impact occurring in we expect the incremental impact of ca harmonization will increase successively over year through primarily due to the liability measurement transition period included in the amended rule the enactment of the hatfa also increased the interest rate assumption used to determine our ca pension cost which ha the effect of lowering the recovery of pension contribution during the affected period it decrease our ca pension cost pension cost recovery under ca occur in different period from when pension contribution are made under the ppa amount contributed in excess of the ca pension cost recovered under government contract are considered to be prepayment credit under the ca rule of december our prepayment credit were approximately billion inclusive of the impact of hatfa compared to billion at december the prepayment balance will increase or decrease based on our actual investment return on plan asset table of content trend we do not plan to make contribution to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in through because none are required using current assumption however we anticipate recovering approximately billion of ca pension cost in and our ca recovery in and to be sequentially higher than in we begin to recover the billion of prepayment credit at december under the ca rule we expect our fa pension expense to be billion which is le than our fa pension expense of billion primarily due to the plan amendment announced in june offset by the impact of the new longevity assumption and the decline in the discount rate also we expect fa ca pension income in of about million compared to fa ca pension income of million in primarily due to higher ca pension cost due to ca harmonization fa ca pension income is expected to increase sequentially from at an approximate rate annually in and environmental matter we are party to various agreement proceeding and potential proceeding for environmental cleanup issue including matter at various site where we have been designated potentially responsible party prp by the environmental protection agency epa or by state agency at december and the total amount of liability recorded on our balance sheet for environmental matter wa million and million we have recorded receivables totaling million and million at december and for the portion of environmental cost that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our product and service for agency of the government discussed below the amount that is expected to be allocated to our non government contract or that is determined to not be recoverable under government contract ha been expensed through cost of sale we project cost and recovery of cost over approximately year we enter into agreement administrative order consent decree that document the extent and timing of our environmental remediation obligation we also are involved in remediation activity at environmental site where formal agreement either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation environmental cleanup activity usually span many year which make estimating the cost more judgmental due to for example changing remediation technology to determine the cost related to cleanup site we have to ass the extent of contamination effect on natural resource the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation and evolving regulatory environmental standard we perform quarterly review of environmental remediation site and record liability and receivables in the period it becomes probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated see the discussion under environmental matter in note significant accounting policy and note legal proceeding commitment and contingency to our consolidated financial statement we consider the above factor in our quarterly estimate of the timing and amount of any future cost that may be required for remediation activity which result in the calculation of range of estimate for particular environmental site we do not discount the recorded liability the amount and timing of future cash payment are not fixed or can not be reliably determined given the required level of judgment and estimation it is likely that materially different amount could be recorded if different assumption were used or if circumstance were to change change in environmental standard or change in our estimate of the extent of contamination on july regulation became effective in california setting the maximum level of the contaminant hexavalent chromium in drinking water at part per billion ppb in may the manufacturer and technology association filed suit alleging the ppb threshold is lower than is required to protect public health and thus imposes unjustified cost on the regulated community we can not predict the outcome of this suit or whether other challenge may be advanced by the regulated community or environmental group which had sought significantly higher and lower standard respectively if the new standard remains at ppb it will not have material impact on our existing remediation cost in california in addition california is reevaluating it existing drinking water standard with respect to second contaminant perchlorate and the epa is also considering whether to regulate perchlorate and hexavalent chromium in drinking water if substantially lower standard are adopted in either california or at the federal level for perchlorate or if the epa were to adopt standard for hexavalent chromium lower than ppb we expect material increase in our estimate for environmental liability and the related asset for the portion of the increased cost that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our product and service for the government the amount that would be allocable to our non government contract or that is determined to not be recoverable under government contract would be expensed which may have material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period table of content under agreement reached with the government most of the amount we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operation general and administrative cost under existing government regulation these and other environmental expenditure relating to our government business after deducting any recovery received from insurance or other prps are allowable in establishing price of our product and service result most of the expenditure we incur are included in our net sale and cost of sale according to government agreement or regulation regardless of the contract form cost reimbursable fixed price we continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing among other factor government regulation our government business base and contract mix and our history of receiving reimbursement of such cost disclosed above we may record change in the amount of environmental remediation liability result of our quarterly review of the status of our environmental remediation site which would result in change to the corresponding environmental receivable and charge to earnings for example if we were to determine that the liability should be increased by million the corresponding receivables would be increased by approximately million with the remainder recorded charge to earnings this allocation is determined annually based upon our existing and projected business activity with the government we reasonably can not determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental site with which we are involved there are number of former operating facility we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation in some case although loss may be probable it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activity because of uncertainty assessing the extent of the contamination during any particular quarter such uncertainty may be resolved allowing to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate particular former operating site the amount of the liability could be material upon recognition of the liability portion will be recognized receivable with the remainder charged to earnings which may have material effect in any particular interim reporting period if we are ultimately found to have liability at those site where we have been designated prp we expect that the actual cost of remediation will be shared with other liable prps generally prps that are ultimately determined to be responsible party are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among to share on an allocated basis the cost and expense for investigation and remediation under existing environmental law responsible party are jointly and severally liable and therefore we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation in the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation the statutory framework provides that we may pursue right of cost recovery or contribution from the other prps the amount we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental cost we have incurred through insurance or from other prps which we are required to pursue by agreement and government regulation goodwill our goodwill balance were billion and billion at december and we perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired such event or change in circumstance may include significant deterioration in overall economic condition change in the business climate of our industry decline in our market capitalization operating performance indicator competition reorganization of our business government budget restriction or the disposal of all or portion of reporting unit our goodwill ha been allocated to and is tested for impairment at level referred to the reporting unit which is our business segment level or level below the business segment the level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires to determine whether the operation below the business segment constitute self sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly review the operating result when testing goodwill for impairment we initially compare the fair value of each reporting unit to it carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if the carrying value of reporting unit exceeds it fair value we then compare the implied value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of it goodwill the implied value of the reporting unit goodwill is calculated by creating hypothetical balance sheet if the reporting unit had been acquired this balance sheet contains all asset and liability recorded at fair value including any assumed intangible asset that may not have any corresponding carrying value in our balance sheet the implied value of the reporting unit goodwill is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the net asset from the fair value of the reporting unit if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess table of content we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using combination of discounted cash flow dcf analysis and market based valuation methodology such comparable public company trading value and value observed in business acquisition determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including the amount and timing of expected future cash flow long term growth rate discount rate and relevant comparable public company earnings multiple and transaction multiple the cash flow employed in the dcf analysis are based on our best estimate of future sale earnings and cash flow after considering factor such general market condition government budget existing firm order expected future order contract with supplier labor agreement change in working capital long term business plan and recent operating performance the discount rate utilized in the dcf analysis are based on the respective reporting unit weighted average cost of capital which take into account the relative weight of each component of capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flow of the respective reporting unit the carrying value of each reporting unit includes the asset and liability employed in it operation goodwill and allocation of amount held at the business segment and corporate level corporate allocation include our postretirement benefit plan liability determined in accordance with ca in order to align the basis of the carrying value with the determination of the fair value of our reporting unit which are measured using ca pension cost ca pension cost is recovered through the pricing of our product and service on government contract and therefore affect the fair value of each reporting unit the amount of ca pension liability allocated to each reporting unit is significantly influenced by number of factor including the discount rate used to estimate the obligation on august the hatfa wa enacted which extended the pension interest rate relief of the prior map result the interest rate used to calculate ca pension cost recovered under our contract with the government increased with the resulting effect of decreasing the amount of ca pension liability allocated to each reporting unit contributing to an increase in the carrying value of each reporting unit in the fourth quarter of we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting unit the result of these test indicated that the estimated fair value of our reporting unit exceeded their carrying value with the exception of our technical service reporting unit within our mfc business segment technical service for which we recorded million goodwill impairment in experienced further decline in fair value during technical service which typically ha smaller customer contract of shorter duration ha been adversely impacted by market pressure such lower in theater support troop level are drawn down and increased re competition on existing contract that are awarded primarily on the basis of price result we compared the implied value of that reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of it goodwill and since the carrying value exceeded the implied value we recorded non cash impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of equal to that differential we continue to experience uncertainty in our business environment due to significant fiscal and economic challenge facing the government our primary customer well market pressure while initiative such the bipartisan budget act provide more measured and strategic approach to addressing the government fiscal challenge budget reduction including sequestration remain long term concern the bipartisan budget act retained sequestration cut for gfys through and the across the board spending reduction methodology provided for in the budget control act generally our business with smaller short term contract are the most susceptible to the impact of budget reduction such our civil reporting unit within our is business segment technical service reporting unit within our mfc business segment and certain service business within our mst business segment the civil reporting unit ha been impacted by the continued downturn in certain federal agency information technology budget and increased re competition on existing contract coupled with fragmentation of large contract into multiple smaller contract that are awarded primarily on the basis of price the carrying value of our civil reporting unit included goodwill of billion of december currently we estimate that the fair value of our civil reporting unit exceeds it carrying value by margin of approximately budget reduction contract cancellation and termination or market pressure could cause our sale earnings and cash flow to further decline below our current projection similarly market factor utilized in the impairment analysis including long term growth rate discount rate and relevant comparable public company earnings multiple and transaction multiple could negatively impact the fair value of our reporting unit based on our current assessment of these circumstance we have determined that our civil reporting unit is at risk of future goodwill impairment should there be further deterioration of projected cash flow negative change in market factor or significant increase in the carrying value of this reporting unit impairment assessment inherently involve management judgment regarding number of assumption described above due to the many variable inherent in the estimation of reporting unit fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill difference in assumption could have material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting unit and could result in goodwill impairment charge in future period table of content recent accounting pronouncement in may

changing foreign currency exchange rate we enter into foreign currency hedge such forward and option contract that change in value foreign currency exchange rate change our most significant foreign currency exposure relate to the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar these contract hedge forecasted foreign currency transaction in order to mitigate fluctuation in our earnings and cash flow associated with change in foreign currency exchange rate we designate foreign currency hedge cash flow hedge we also are exposed to the impact of interest rate change primarily through our borrowing activity for fixed rate borrowing we may use variable interest rate swap effectively converting fixed rate borrowing to variable rate borrowing indexed to libor in order to reduce the amount

logistics and information service we serve both and international customer with product and service that have defense civil and commercial application with our principal customer being agency of the government basis of presentation our consolidated financial statement include the account of subsidiary we control and variable interest entity if we are the primary beneficiary we eliminate intercompany balance and transaction in consolidation our receivables inventory customer advance and amount in excess of cost incurred and certain amount in other current liability primarily are attributable to long term contract or program in progress for which the related operating cycle are longer than one year in accordance with industry practice we include these item in current asset and current liability unless otherwise noted we present all per share amount cited in these consolidated financial statement on per diluted share basis use of estimate we prepare our consolidated financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle gaap in doing so we are required to make estimate and assumption that affect the amount reported in the consolidated financial statement and accompanying note we base these estimate on historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying amount of asset and liability that are not readily apparent from other source our actual result may differ materially from these estimate significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement include but are not limited to accounting for sale and cost recognition postretirement benefit plan environmental receivables and liability evaluation of goodwill and other asset for impairment income tax including deferred tax asset fair value measurement and contingency sale and earnings we record net sale and estimated profit for substantially all of our contract using the percentage of completion method for cost reimbursable and fixed price contract for product and service with the government sale are recorded on all time and material contract the work is performed based on agreed upon hourly rate and allowable cost we account for our service contract with non government customer using the service method of accounting we classify net sale product or service on our statement of earnings based on the attribute of the underlying contract percentage of completion method of accounting the percentage of completion method for product contract depends on the nature of the product provided under the contract for example for contract that require to perform significant level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract and or to deliver minimal quantity sale are recorded using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion under the cost to cost method of accounting we recognize sale and an estimated profit cost are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred cost bear to total estimated cost for contract that require to provide substantial number of similar item without significant level of development we record sale and an estimated profit on percentage of completion basis using unit of delivery the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract for contract to provide service to the government sale are generally recorded using the cost to cost method award and incentive fee well penalty related to contract performance are considered in estimating sale and profit rate on contract accounted for under the percentage of completion method estimate of award fee are based on past experience and anticipated performance we record incentive or penalty when there is sufficient information to ass anticipated contract performance incentive provision that increase or decrease earnings based solely on single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs accounting for contract using the percentage of completion method requires judgment relative to assessing risk estimating contract sale and cost including estimating award and incentive fee and penalty related to performance and making assumption for schedule and technical issue due to the number of year it may take to complete many of our contract and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contract the estimation of total sale and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variable and accordingly is subject to change when adjustment in estimated total contract sale or estimated total cost are required any change from prior estimate are recognized in the table of content current period for the inception to date effect of such change when estimate of total cost to be incurred on contract exceed estimate of total sale to be earned provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined many of our contract span several year and include highly complex technical requirement at the outset of contract we identify and monitor risk to the achievement of the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract and ass the effect of those risk on our estimate of total cost to complete the contract the estimate consider the technical requirement newly developed product versus mature product the schedule and associated task the number and type of milestone event and cost material labor subcontractor overhead and the estimated cost to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreement sometimes referred to offset agreement required under certain contract with international customer the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risk surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirement schedule and cost in the initial estimated total cost to complete the contract profit booking rate may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risk surrounding the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract which decrease the estimated total cost to complete the contract conversely our profit booking rate may decrease if the estimated total cost to complete the contract increase all of the estimate are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate in addition comparability of our segment sale operating profit and operating margin may be impacted by change in profit booking rate on our contract accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting increase in the profit booking rate typically referred to risk retirement usually relate to revision in the estimated total cost that reflect improved condition on particular contract conversely condition on particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated total cost to complete and reduction in the profit booking rate increase or decrease in profit booking rate are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception to date effect of such change segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other item favorable item may include the positive resolution of contractual matter cost recovery on restructuring charge and insurance recovery unfavorable item may include the adverse resolution of contractual matter asset impairment restructuring charge except for significant severance action such those mentioned below in note which are excluded from segment operating result and reserve for dispute segment operating profit and item such risk retirement reduction of profit booking rate or other matter are presented net of state income tax our consolidated net adjustment not related to volume including net profit booking rate adjustment and other matter net of state income tax increased segment operating profit by approximately billion in billion in and billion in these adjustment increased net earnings by approximately billion per share in billion per share in and billion per share in service method of accounting for cost reimbursable contract for service to non government customer we record net sale service are performed except for award and incentive fee award and incentive fee are recorded when they are fixed or determinable generally at the date the amount is communicated to by the customer this approach result in the recognition of such fee at contractual interval typically every six month throughout the contract and is dependent on the customer process for notification of award and issuance of formal notification under fixed price service contract we are paid predetermined fixed amount for specified scope of work and generally have full responsibility for the cost associated with the contract and the resulting profit or loss we record net sale under fixed price service contract with non government customer on straight line basis over the period of contract performance unless evidence suggests that net sale are earned or the obligation are fulfilled in different pattern cost for all service contract are expensed incurred research and development and similar cost except for certain arrangement described below we account for independent research and development cost part of the general and administrative cost that are allocated among all of our contract and program in progress under government contractual arrangement and charged to cost of sale under certain arrangement in which customer share in product development cost our portion of unreimbursed cost is expensed incurred in cost of sale independent research and development cost charged to cost of sale totaled million in million in and million in cost we incur under customer sponsored research and development program pursuant to contract are included in net sale and cost of sale stock based compensation compensation cost related to all share based payment is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award we generally recognize the compensation cost ratably over three year vesting period table of content income tax we calculate our provision for income tax using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax asset and liability are recognized based on the future tax consequence attributable to temporary difference that exist between the financial statement carrying amount of asset and liability and their respective tax base well from operating loss and tax credit carry forward we measure deferred tax asset and liability using enacted tax rate that will apply in the year in which we expect the temporary difference to be recovered or paid we periodically ass our tax filing exposure related to period that are open to examination based on the latest available information we evaluate our tax position to determine whether the position will more likely than not be sustained upon examination by the internal revenue service irs if we can not reach more likely than not determination no benefit is recorded if we determine that the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained we record the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized when the tax position is settled we record interest and penalty related to income tax component of income tax expense on our statement of earnings interest and penalty were not material cash and cash equivalent cash equivalent include highly liquid instrument with original maturity of day or le receivables receivables include amount billed and currently due from customer and unbilled cost and accrued profit primarily related to sale on long term contract that have been recognized but not yet billed to customer pursuant to contract provision agency of the government and certain other customer have title to or security interest in asset related to such contract result of advance performance based payment and progress payment we reflect those advance and payment an offset to the related receivables balance for contract that we account for on percentage of completion basis using the cost to cost method to measure progress towards completion inventory we record inventory at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value cost on long term contract and program in progress represent recoverable cost incurred for production or contract specific facility and equipment allocable operating overhead advance to supplier and in the case of contract with the government and substantially all other government research and development and general and administrative expense pursuant to contract provision agency of the government and certain other customer have title to or security interest in inventory related to such contract result of advance performance based payment and progress payment we reflect those advance and payment an offset against the related inventory balance for contract that we account for on percentage of completion basis using unit of delivery the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract we determine the cost of other product and supply inventory by the first in first out or average cost method property plant and equipment we record property plant and equipment at cost we provide for depreciation and amortization on plant and equipment generally using accelerated method during the first half of the estimated useful life of the asset and the straight line method thereafter the estimated useful life of our plant and equipment generally range from to year for building and five to year for machinery and equipment no depreciation expense is recorded on construction in progress until such asset are placed into operation depreciation expense related to plant and equipment wa million in million in and million in we review the carrying amount of long lived asset for impairment if event or change in the fact and circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable we ass impairment by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flow of the related asset grouping to it carrying amount if an asset is determined to be impaired we recognize an impairment charge in the current period for the difference between the fair value of the asset and it carrying amount capitalized software we capitalize certain cost associated with the development or purchase of internal use software the amount capitalized are included in other noncurrent asset on our balance sheet and are amortized on straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the resulting software which range from two to six year of december and capitalized software totaled million and million net of accumulated amortization of billion and billion no amortization expense is recorded until the software is ready for it intended use amortization expense related to capitalized software wa million in million in and million in goodwill we perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter and more frequently whenever certain event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired such event or change in circumstance may include significant deterioration in overall economic condition change in the business climate of our industry decline in our market capitalization operating performance indicator competition reorganization of our business or the disposal of all or portion of reporting unit our goodwill ha been allocated to and is tested for table of content impairment at level referred to the reporting unit which is our business segment level or level below the business segment the level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires to determine whether the operation below the business segment constitute business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly review the operating result when testing goodwill for impairment we initially compare the fair value of each reporting unit to it carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if the carrying value of reporting unit exceeds it fair value we then compare the implied value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of it goodwill the implied value of the reporting unit goodwill is calculated by creating hypothetical balance sheet if the reporting unit had just been acquired this balance sheet contains all asset and liability recorded at fair value including any intangible asset that may not have any corresponding carrying value in our balance sheet the implied value of the reporting unit goodwill is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the net asset from the fair value of the reporting unit if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using combination of discounted cash flow dcf analysis and market based valuation methodology such comparable public company trading value and value observed in business acquisition determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgment about the amount and timing of expected future cash flow long term growth rate discount rate and relevant comparable public company earnings multiple and transaction multiple the cash flow employed in the dcf analysis are based on our best estimate of future sale earnings and cash flow after considering factor such general market condition government budget existing firm order expected future order contract with supplier labor agreement change in working capital long term business plan and recent operating performance the discount rate utilized in the dcf analysis are based on the respective reporting unit weighted average cost of capital which take into account the relative weight of each component of capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flow of the respective reporting unit in the fourth quarter of we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting unit the result of these test indicated that the estimated fair value of our reporting unit exceeded their carrying value with the exception of our technical service reporting unit within our missile and fire control mfc business segment the impact of market pressure such lower in theater support troop level are drawn down and increased re competition on existing contract that are awarded primarily on the basis of price adversely impacted the fair value of this reporting unit result we compared the implied value of that reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of it goodwill and since the carrying value exceeded the implied value we recorded non cash impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of equal to that differential this charge reduced our net earnings by million per share during the fourth quarter of due to the continuing impact of defense budget reduction and related competitive pressure on the technical service business we recorded non cash goodwill impairment charge of million this charge reduced our net earnings by million per share customer advance and amount in excess of cost incurred we receive advance performance based payment and progress payment from customer that may exceed cost incurred on certain contract including contract with agency of the government we classify such advance other than those reflected reduction of receivables or inventory discussed above current liability postretirement benefit plan many of our employee are covered by defined benefit pension plan and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefit to eligible retiree collectively postretirement benefit plan gaap requires that the amount we record related to our postretirement benefit plan be computed based on service to date using actuarial valuation that are based in part on certain key economic assumption we make including the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan asset and other actuarial assumption including participant longevity also known mortality estimate the expected rate of increase in future compensation level through december for our non union plan health care cost trend rate and employee turnover each appropriate based on the nature of the plan we recognize on plan by plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plan under gaap either an asset recorded within other noncurrent asset or liability recorded within noncurrent liability on our balance sheet there is corresponding non cash adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax benefit recorded deferred tax asset in stockholder equity the gaap funded status is measured the difference between the fair value of the plan asset and the benefit obligation of the plan the funded status under the employee retirement income security act of erisa amended by the pension protection act of ppa is calculated on different basis than under gaap table of content environmental matter we record liability for environmental matter when it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the cost to be incurred for remediation at particular site we do not discount the recorded liability the amount and timing of future cash payment are not fixed or can not be reliably determined our environmental liability are recorded on our balance sheet within other liability both current and noncurrent we expect to include substantial portion of environmental cost in our net sale and cost of sale in future period pursuant to government agreement or regulation at the time liability is recorded for future environmental cost we record receivable for estimated future recovery considered probable through the pricing of product and service to agency of the government regardless of the contract form cost reimbursable fixed price we continuously evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing among other factor government regulation our government business base and contract mix and our history of receiving reimbursement of such cost we include the portion of those environmental cost expected to be allocated to our non government contract or that is determined to not be recoverable under government contract in our cost of sale at the time the liability is established our environmental receivables are recorded on our balance sheet within other asset both current and noncurrent we project cost and recovery of cost over approximately year investment in marketable security investment in marketable security consist of debt and equity security and are classified trading security of december and the fair value of our trading security totaled billion and billion

to exercise significant influence but do not control are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are included in other noncurrent asset on our balance sheet significant influence typically exists if we have to ownership interest in the investee under this method of accounting our share of the net earnings or loss of the investee is included in operating profit in other income net on our statement of earnings since the activity of the investee are closely aligned with the operation of the business segment holding the investment we evaluate our equity method investment for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of such investment may be impaired if decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other than temporary loss is recorded in earnings in the current period of december and our equity method investment totaled million and million which primarily are composed of our space system

hedge such forward and option contract that change in value foreign currency exchange rate change these contract hedge forecasted foreign currency transaction in order to mitigate fluctuation in our earnings and cash flow associated with change in foreign currency exchange rate we designate foreign currency hedge cash flow hedge we also are exposed to the impact of interest rate change primarily through our borrowing activity for fixed rate borrowing we may use variable interest rate swap effectively converting fixed rate borrowing to variable rate borrowing in order to reduce the amount of

to mitigate the impact of interest rate change on earnings these swap are designated cash flow hedge we also may enter into derivative instrument that are not designated hedge and do not qualify for hedge accounting which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposure we record derivative at their fair value the classification of gain and loss resulting from change in the fair value of

per common share by dividing net earnings by the respective weighted average number of common share outstanding for the period presented our calculation of diluted earnings per common share also includes the dilutive effect for the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock unit and exercise of outstanding stock option based on the treasury stock method the computation of diluted

of legal or other proceeding with certainty gaap requires to disclose an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss or make statement that such an estimate can not be made for contingency where there is at least reasonable possibility that loss may have been incurred we have thorough process to determine an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss before we conclude and disclose that an estimate can not be made accordingly unless otherwise indicated below in our discussion of legal proceeding reasonably possible loss or range of loss associated with any individual legal proceeding can not be estimated table of content legal proceeding on april we filed declaratory judgment action against the new york metropolitan transportation authority and it capital construction company collectively the mta asking the district court for the southern district of new york to find that the mta is in material breach of our agreement based on the mta failure to provide access to site where work must be performed and the customer furnished equipment necessary to complete the contract the mta filed an answer and counterclaim alleging that we breached the contract and subsequently terminated the contract for alleged default the primary damage sought by the mta are the cost to complete the contract and potential re procurement cost while we are unable to estimate the cost of another contractor to complete the contract and the cost of re procurement we note that our contract with the mta had total value of million of which million wa paid to and that the mta is seeking damage of approximately million we dispute the mta allegation and are defending against them additionally following an investigation our surety on performance bond related to this matter who were represented by independent counsel concluded that the mta termination of the contract wa improper finally our declaratory judgment action wa later amended to include claim for monetary damage against the mta of approximately million this matter wa taken under submission by the district court on december after five week bench trial and the filing of post trial pleading by the party we expect decision in the second or third quarter of on august the department of justice doj filed complaint in partial intervention in two lawsuit filed under the civil qui tam provision of the false claim act in the district court for the western district of kentucky united state ex rel natural resource defense council et al lockheed martin corporation et al and united state ex rel john tillson lockheed martin energy system inc et al the doj alleges that we committed violation of the resource conservation and recovery act at the paducah gaseous diffusion plant by not properly handling storing and transporting hazardous waste and that we violated the false claim act by misleading department of energy official and state regulator about the nature and extent of environmental noncompliance at the plant the complaint doe not allege specific calculation of damage in april the party attended settlement conference ordered by the magistrate judge the conference focused on the party sharply differing view of the merit of the case and did not significantly contribute to our understanding of the damage sought the party participated in confidential mediation pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure rule in december the plaintiff made settlement demand at this mediation but these were not tied to any theory of damage were not apportioned between the false claim act and resource conservation and recovery act allegation to which our defense differ and did not provide insight into what damage plaintiff would seek to prove if this matter proceeds to trial consequently we continue to be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss which could be incurred if the plaintiff were to prevail but we believe we have substantial defense we anticipate filing motion for summary judgment in the second quarter of environmental matter we are involved in environmental proceeding and potential proceeding relating to soil and groundwater contamination disposal of hazardous waste and other environmental matter at several of our current or former facility or at third party site where we have been designated potentially responsible party prp substantial portion of environmental cost will be included in our net sale and cost of sale in future period pursuant to government regulation at the time liability is recorded for future environmental cost we record receivable for estimated future recovery considered probable through the pricing of product and service to agency of the government regardless of the contract form cost reimbursable fixed price we continuously evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing among other factor government regulation our government business base and contract mix and our history of receiving reimbursement of such cost we include the portion of those environmental cost expected to be allocated to our non government contract or that is determined to not be recoverable under government contract in our cost of sale at the time the liability is established at december and the aggregate amount of liability recorded relative to environmental matter wa million and million most of which are recorded in other noncurrent liability on our balance sheet we have recorded receivables totaling million and million at december and most of which are recorded in other noncurrent asset on our balance sheet for the estimated future recovery of these cost we consider the recovery probable based on the factor previously mentioned we project cost and recovery of cost over approximately year environmental cleanup activity usually span several year which make estimating liability matter of judgment because of uncertainty with respect to assessing the extent of the contamination well such factor changing remediation technology and continually evolving regulatory environmental standard there are number of former operating facility that we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation we perform quarterly review of the status of our environmental remediation site and the related liability and receivables additionally in our quarterly table of content review we consider these and other factor in estimating the timing and amount of any future cost that may be required for remediation activity and record liability when it is probable that loss ha occurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the cost to be incurred for remediation at particular site we do not discount the recorded liability the amount and timing of future cash payment are not fixed or can not be reliably determined we reasonably can not determine the extent of our financial exposure in all case although loss may be probable or reasonably possible in some case it is not possible at this time to estimate the loss or reasonably possible loss or range of loss we also are pursuing claim for recovery of cost incurred or contribution to site cleanup cost against other prps including the government and are conducting remediation activity under various consent decree and order relating to soil groundwater sediment or surface water contamination at certain site of former or current operation under an agreement related to our burbank and glendale california site the government reimburses an amount equal to approximately of expenditure for certain remediation activity in it capacity prp under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla on july regulation became effective in california setting the maximum level of the contaminant hexavalent chromium in drinking water at part per billion ppb in may the manufacturer and technology association filed suit alleging the ppb threshold is lower than is required to protect public health and thus imposes unjustified cost on the regulated community we can not predict the outcome of this suit or whether other challenge may be advanced by the regulated community or environmental group which had sought significantly higher and lower standard respectively if the new standard remains at ppb it will not have material impact on our existing remediation cost in california in addition california is reevaluating it existing drinking water standard with respect to perchlorate and the environmental protection agency epa is also considering whether to regulate perchlorate and hexavalent chromium in drinking water if substantially lower standard are adopted in either california or at the federal level for perchlorate or if the epa were to adopt standard for hexavalent chromium lower than ppb we expect material increase in our estimate for environmental liability and the related asset for the portion of the increased cost that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our product and service for the government the amount that would be allocable to our non government contract or that is determined to not be recoverable under government contract would be expensed which may have material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period operating lease we rent certain equipment and facility under operating lease certain major plant facility and equipment are furnished by the government under short term or cancelable arrangement our total

generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform in some case we may guarantee the contractual performance of third party such venture partner we had total outstanding letter of credit surety bond and third party guarantee aggregating billion each at december and at december and third party guarantee totaled million and million of which approximately and related to guarantee of contractual performance of venture to which we currently are or previously were party this amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non performance of the venture partner in addition we generally have cross indemnity in place that may enable to recover amount that may be paid on behalf of venture partner we believe our current and former venture partner will be able to perform their obligation they have done through december and that it will not be necessary to make payment under the guarantee in determining our exposure we evaluate the reputation technical capability and credit quality of our current and former venture partner united launch alliance in connection with our ownership interest of ula we and the boeing company boeing have each received distribution from ula including distribution of million that we and boeing have each received since ula formation in december which are subject to agreement between boeing and ula whereby if ula doe not have table of content sufficient cash resource or credit capacity to make required payment under the inventory supply agreement it ha with boeing both we and
