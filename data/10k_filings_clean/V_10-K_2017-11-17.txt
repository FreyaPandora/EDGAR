landscape is changing how we compete creating local network or enabling processing competition we compete all form of payment this includes paper based payment primarily cash and check and all form of electronic payment our electronic payment competitor principally include global or multi regional network which typically offer range of branded general purpose card payment product that can be used at million of merchant location around the world example include mastercard american express discover jcb and unionpay these competitor may be more concentrated in specific geographic region such jcb in japan and discover in the united state or have leading position in certain country for example unionpay operates the sole domestic acceptance mark in china and is expanding into other global market see item risk factor regulatory risk government imposed restriction on payment system may prevent from competing against provider in certain country including significant market such china and russia based on available data visa is one of the largest retail electronic fund transfer network used throughout the world the following chart compare our network with these network competitor for calendar year unionpay which operates primarily within the chinese domestic market is not included in this table visa currently doe not compete in that market under local law although we are uncertain how

product local and regional network that operate in many country often with the support of government influence or mandate in some case they are owned by financial institution these network typically focus on debit payment product have functionality or their brand mark present with the visa brand on the card or payment device and may have strong local acceptance and recognizable brand example include star nyce and pulse in the united state interac in canada eftpos in australia and mir in russia alternate payment provider which often have primary focus of enabling payment through ecommerce and mobile channel but which are expanding or may expand their offering to the physical point of sale these company may process payment using in house account transfer between party electronic fund transfer network like the automated clearing house ach or global or local network like visa in some case these entity are both partner and competitor to visa example of alternate payment provider include paypal alipay and wechat alipay and wechat pay are among the fastest growing mobile payment provider in the world and may pose competitive challenge to visa and other international network outside of china of contentsother electronic payment network like the ach in the united state are often regulated by local government historically focused on interbank transfer many are adding capability that may make them more competitive for retail payment mastercard acquired vocalink holding limited in which provides faster payment technology that competes with our visa direct offering we also compete with closed loop payment system emerging payment network like zelle wire transfer and electronic benefit transfer payment processor which we compete with for the processing of visa transaction or which may benefit from mandate requiring them to handle processing under local regulation for example result of regulation in europe under the interchange fee regulation ifr we may face competition from other network processor and other third party could process visa transaction directly with issuer and acquirer we also face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the price we charge our financial institution client we believe our fundamental value proposition of acceptance security convenience speed and reliability offer key competitive advantage we succeed in part we

regulationas global payment technology company we are subject to complex and evolving global regulation in the various jurisdiction in which our product and service are used the most significant government regulation that impact our business are discussed for further discussion of how global regulation may impact our business see item risk factor regulatory risk supervisory oversight of the payment industry visa is subject to financial sector oversight and regulation in substantially all of the jurisdiction in which we operate in the united state for example the federal financial institution examination council ffiec ha supervisory oversight over visa under applicable federal banking law and policy technology service provider to financial institution the federal banking agency comprising the ffiec are the federal reserve board the comptroller of the currency the federal deposit insurance corporation the national credit union administration and the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb visa also may be separately examined by the cfpb service provider to the bank that issue visa branded consumer credit and debit card product central bank in other country including russia ukraine hong kong and the united kingdom discussed below have recognized or designated visa for purpose of various degree of financial stability regulation retail payment system visa is also subject to oversight by banking and financial sector authority in other jurisdiction such brazil mexico uruguay and colombia government imposed market participation and restriction certain government including china russia indonesia and india have taken action to advantage domestic payment system and or certain issuer payment network or processor including by imposing regulation that favor domestic provider impose local ownership requirement on processor or mandate domestic processing be done entirely in that country of contentsinterchange rate and fee an increasing number of jurisdiction around the world regulate or influence debit and credit interchange reimbursement rate in their region for example the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer act dodd frank act in the united state limit interchange reimbursement rate for certain debit card transaction the european union eu ifr limit interchange rate in europe discussed below and the reserve bank of australia regulates average permissible level of interchange network exclusivity and routing in the united state the dodd frank act limit network exclusivity and preferred routing arrangement for the debit and prepaid market segment other jurisdiction impose similar limitation such the ifr prohibition on restriction that prevent multiple payment brand or functionality on the same card no surcharge rule we have historically enforced rule that prohibit merchant from charging higher price to consumer who pay using visa product instead of other mean however merchant ability to surcharge varies by geographic market well visa product type and continues to be impacted by litigation regulation and legislation privacy and data protection aspect of our operation or business are subject to privacy data use and data security regulation which impact the way we use and handle data operate our product and service and even impact our ability to offer product or service in addition regulator are proposing new law or regulation which could require visa to adopt certain cybersecurity and data handling practice in many jurisdiction consumer must be notified in the event of data breach and such notification requirement continue to increase in scope and cost the changing privacy law in the united state europe and elsewhere including the adoption by the european union of the general data protection regulation which will become effective in may create new individual privacy right and impose increased obligation on company handling personal data anti corruption anti money laundering anti terrorism and sanction we are subject to anti corruption law and regulation including the foreign corrupt practice act fcpa the uk bribery act and other law that generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payment to foreign government official and political figure for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to gain an unfair business advantage we are also subject to anti

engage in transaction using our service internet transaction many jurisdiction have adopted regulation that require payment system participant to monitor identify filter restrict or take other action with regard to certain type of payment transaction on the internet such gambling and the purchase of cigarette or alcohol additional regulatory development various regulatory agency also continue to examine wide variety of other issue including mobile payment transaction tokenization access right for non financial institution money transfer identity theft account management guideline disclosure rule security and marketing that could affect our financial institution client and european regulation and supervisory oversight in addition following the visa europe acquisition in june we are

addition to following sec filing and publicly available conference call the information contained on or accessible through our corporate website including the information contained on our investor relation website is not incorporated by reference into this report or any other report filed with or furnished to the sec item risk factor regulatory risksincreased regulation of the global payment industry including with respect to interchange reimbursement fee operating rule and related practice could harm our business regulator around the world have been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate certain aspect of the payment industry see item business government regulation for more information in the united state and many other jurisdiction we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fee even though we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fee in payment transaction those fee are paid by the acquirer to the issuer interchange reimbursement fee are factor on which we compete with other payment provider and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transaction we process consequently change to these fee whether voluntarily or by mandate can substantially affect our overall payment volume and revenue interchange reimbursement fee certain operating rule and related practice continue to be subject to increased government regulation globally and regulatory authority and central bank in number of jurisdiction have reviewed or are reviewing these fee rule and practice for example the federal reserve cap the maximum debit interchange reimbursement rate received by large financial institution at cent plus basis point per transaction plus possible fraud adjustment of cent the dodd frank act also limit issuer and our ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid area which also impact our business the eu ifr place an effective cap on consumer credit and consumer debit interchange fee for both domestic and cross border transaction within europe basis point and basis point respectively eu member state have the ability to further restrict these interchange level within their territory more recently in march argentina central bank passed regulation that cap interchange fee on credit and debit transaction in addition to the regulation of interchange reimbursement fee number of regulator impose restriction on other aspect of our payment business for example government regulation or pressure may require to allow other payment network to support visa product or service or to have the other network functionality or brand mark on our product innovation in payment technology have enabled to expand into new product and service they have also expanded the potential scope of regulatory influence in addition the european union requirement to separate scheme and processing add cost and continues to impact the efficient integration of visa europe the execution of our commercial innovation and product strategy our ability to provide effective account holder service the amount of data available for use in fraud and risk system and loyalty service of contentswe are also subject to central bank oversight in some market including the united kingdom and within the european union this oversight could result in new governance reporting licensing cybersecurity processing infrastructure capital or credit risk management requirement we could also be required to adopt policy and practice designed to mitigate settlement and liquidity risk including increased requirement to maintain sufficient level of capital and financial resource locally well localized risk management or governance increased central bank oversight could also lead to new or different criterion for participation in and access to our payment system including allowing non traditional financial technology company to act issuer or acquirer additionally regulator in other jurisdiction are considering or adopting approach based on similar regulatory principle regulator around the world increasingly take note of each other approach to regulating the payment industry consequently development in one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approach in another the risk created by new law or regulation in one jurisdiction have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another jurisdiction or in other product offering similarly new regulation involving one product offering may prompt regulator to extend the regulation to other product offering for example credit payment could become subject to similar regulation debit payment additionally regulation in an individual country could expand for example the reserve bank of australia initially capped credit interchange but subsequently capped debit interchange well when we can not set default interchange reimbursement rate at optimal level issuer and acquirer may find our payment system le attractive this may increase the attractiveness of other payment system such our competitor closed loop payment system with direct connection to both merchant and consumer we believe some issuer may react to such regulation by charging new or higher fee or reducing certain benefit to consumer which make our product le appealing to consumer some acquirer may elect to charge higher merchant discount rate regardless of the visa interchange reimbursement rate causing merchant not to accept our product or to steer customer to alternate payment system or form of payment in addition in an effort to reduce the expense of their payment program some issuer and acquirer have obtained and may continue to obtain incentive from including reduction in the fee that we charge which may directly impact our revenue for these reason increased global regulation of the payment industry may make our product le desirable diminish our ability to compete reduce our transaction volume and harm our business government imposed restriction on payment system may prevent from competing against provider in certain country including significant market such china and russia government in number of jurisdiction shield domestic payment card network brand and processor from international competition by imposing market access barrier and preferential domestic regulation to varying degree these policy and regulation affect the term of competition in the marketplace and undermine the competitiveness of international payment network in the future public authority may impose regulatory requirement that favor domestic provider or mandate that domestic payment processing be performed entirely within that country which would prevent from managing the end to end processing of certain transaction in russia legislation effectively prevents from processing domestic transaction the central bank controlled national payment card system nspk is the only entity allowed to process domestically in china unionpay remains the sole processor of domestic payment card transaction and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark although we have filed an application with the people bank of china pboc to operate bank card clearing institution bcci in china the timing and the procedural step remain uncertain the approval process might require several year and there is no guarantee that the license to operate bcci will be approved or if we obtain such license that we will be able to successfully compete with domestic payment network furthermore due to our inability to manage the end to end processing of transaction for card in certain country we depend on our close working relationship with our client or third party processor to ensure transaction involving our product are processed effectively our ability to do may be adversely affected by regulatory requirement and policy pertaining to transaction routing or on shore processing co badging and co residency regulation may pose additional challenge in market where visa competes with national scheme for issuance and routing for example in china certain bank have issued dual branded card for which domestic transaction in china are processed by unionpay and transaction outside of china are processed by or other international payment network the pboc is contemplating that dual branded card could be phased over time new license are issued to international company to participate in china domestic payment market accordingly we have been working with chinese issuer to issue visa only branded card for international travel and later for domestic transaction after we obtain bcci license however notwithstanding such effort the phase out of dual branded card may decrease our payment volume and impact the revenue we generate in china of contentsmir and unionpay have grown rapidly in russia and china respectively and are actively pursuing international expansion plan although regulatory barrier shield mir and unionpay from competition in russia and china respectively alternate payment provider such alipay and wechat pay have rapidly expanded into commerce offline and cross border payment which could make it difficult for to compete even if our license is approved in china earlier this year with strong backing from china government new digital transaction routing system known netlink wa established the pboc allowed alipay and other digital payment provider to invest in netlink it and other such system could have competitive advantage in comparison with other international payment network in general national law that protect domestic processing may increase our cost decrease our payment volume and impact the revenue we generate in those country decrease the number of visa product issued or processed impede from utilizing our global processing capability and controlling the quality of the service supporting our brand restrict our activity limit our growth and the ability to introduce new product service and innovation force to leave country or prevent from entering new market and create new competitor all of which could harm our business we are subject to complex and evolving global regulation that could harm our business and financial result global payment technology company we are subject to complex and evolving regulation that govern our operation see item business government regulation for more information on the most significant area of regulation that affect our business the impact of these regulation on our client and other third party could limit our ability to enforce our payment system rule require to adopt new rule or change existing rule affect our existing contractual arrangement increase our compliance cost require to make our technology or intellectual property available to third party including competitor in an undesirable manner and reduce our revenue opportunity we may face differing rule and regulation in matter like interchange reimbursement rate preferred routing domestic processing requirement currency conversion point of sale transaction rule and practice privacy data use or protection and associated product technology result the visa rule and our other contractual commitment may differ from country to country or by product offering complying with these and other regulation increase our cost and could reduce our revenue opportunity if widely varying regulation come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offering service fee and other important aspect of our business in the various region where we operate our compliance program and policy are designed to support our compliance with wide array of regulation and law such anti money laundering sanction and anti corruption and we continually enhance our compliance program regulation evolve however we can not guarantee that our practice will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authority in the event our control should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reason we could be subject to monetary damage civil and criminal penalty litigation investigation and proceeding and damage to our global brand and reputation furthermore the evolving and increased regulatory focus on the payment industry could negatively impact or reduce the number of visa product our client issue the volume of payment we process our revenue our brand our competitive positioning our ability to use our intellectual property to differentiate our product and service the quality and type of product and service we offer the country in which our product are used and the type of consumer and merchant who can obtain or accept our product all of which could harm our business law and regulation regarding the handling of personal data and information may impede our service or result in increased cost legal claim or fine against our business relies on the processing of data in many jurisdiction and the movement of data across national border legal requirement relating to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data continue to evolve and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world significant uncertainty exists privacy and data protection law may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirement for example the gdpr which becomes effective in may extends the scope of the eu data protection law to all company processing data of eu resident regardless of the company location the law requires company to meet new requirement regarding the handling of personal data including new right such the portability of personal data although we have an extensive program underway to address gdpr requirement our effort to comply with gdpr and other privacy and data protection law may entail substantial expense may divert resource from other initiative and project and could limit the service we are able to offer furthermore enforcement action and investigation by regulatory authority related to data security incident and privacy violation continue to increase the enactment of more restrictive law rule regulation or future enforcement action or investigation could impact through increased cost or restriction on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalty and significant legal liability of contentswe may be subject to tax examination or dispute or change in tax law we exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income tax and other tax liability although we believe our tax estimate are reasonable many factor may limit their accuracy we are currently under examination by or in dispute with the internal revenue service the uk hm revenue custom well tax authority in other jurisdiction and we may be subject to additional examination or dispute in the future relevant tax authority may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material item and thereby increase our tax liability failure to sustain our position in these matter could harm our cash flow and financial position in addition change in existing law such recent proposal for fundamental and international tax reform or those resulting from the base erosion and profit shifting project conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development may also increase our effective tax rate substantial increase in our tax payment could have material adverse effect on our financial result see also note income tax to our consolidated financial statement included in item financial statement and supplementary data of this report litigation riskswe may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or investigation despite certain protection that are in place we are involved in numerous litigation matter investigation and proceeding asserted by civil litigant government and enforcement body alleging violation of competition and antitrust law consumer protection law and intellectual property law among others these are referred to action in this section detail of the most significant action we face are described more fully in note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item financial statement and supplementary data of this report these action are inherently uncertain expensive and disruptive to our operation in the event we are found liable in any material action particularly in large class action lawsuit or an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damage or arising from government investigation we may be required to pay significant award settlement or fine in addition settlement term judgment or pressure resulting from action may harm our business by requiring to modify the default interchange reimbursement rate we set revise the visa rule or the way in which we enforce our rule modify our fee or pricing or modify the way we do business the outcome of these action may also influence regulator investigator government or civil litigant in the same or other jurisdiction which may lead to the assertion of additional action against visa finally we are required by some of our commercial agreement to indemnify other entity for litigation asserted against them even if visa is not defendant for certain action like the covered litigation and the territory covered litigation which are described in note and europe retrospective responsibility plan and note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item financial statement and supplementary data of this report we have certain protection provided in the respective retrospective responsibility plan the two retrospective responsibility plan are different in the protection they provide and the mechanism by which we are able to either fund settlement or judgment in the case of the covered litigation or recoup covered loss in the case of the ve territory covered litigation the failure of one or both of the retrospective responsibility plan to adequately insulate from the impact of such settlement judgment loss or liability could materially harm our financial condition or cash flow or even cause to become insolvent business riskswe face intense competition in our industry the global payment space is intensely competitive technology evolves new competitor emerge and existing client and competitor assume different role our product compete with cash check electronic fund virtual currency payment global or multi regional network other closed loop payment system and alternate payment provider primarily focused on enabling payment through ecommerce and mobile channel the global payment space becomes more complex we face increasing competition from our client emerging payment provider and other digital and technology company many of these provider have developed payment system enabled through online activity in ecommerce and mobile channel and are seeking to expand into other channel that compete with or replace our product and service of contentsadditionally some of our competitor may develop substantially better technology more widely adopted delivery channel or have greater financial resource they may offer more innovative or wider range of program product and service they may use more effective advertising and marketing strategy that result in broader brand recognition and greater issuance and merchant acceptance they may also develop better security solution or more favorable pricing arrangement moreover even if we successfully adapt to technological change and the proliferation of alternative type of payment service by developing and offering our own service in these area such service may provide le favorable financial term for than we currently receive from visanet transaction which could hurt our financial result and prospect certain of our competitor operate with different business model have different cost structure or participate in different market segment those business model may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to regulatory technological and other development in some case these competitor have the support of government mandate that prohibit limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for transaction within certain country and region some of our competitor including american express discover private label card network virtual currency provider technology company that enable the exchange of digital asset and certain alternate payment system operate closed loop payment system with direct connection to both merchant and consumer government action or initiative such the dodd frank act or the federal reserve faster payment initiative may provide them with increased opportunity to derive competitive advantage from these business model similarly regulation in europe under and the ifr and in the united kingdom through the psr may require to open up access to and allow participation in our network to additional participant and reduce the infrastructure investment and regulatory burden on potential competitor we also run the risk of disintermediation due to factor such emerging technology including mobile payment alternate payment credential other ledger technology or payment form and by virtue of increasing bilateral agreement between entity that prefer not to use our payment network for processing transaction for example merchant could process transaction directly with issuer or processor could process transaction directly with issuer and acquirer we expect the competitive landscape to continue to shift and evolve for example competitor client and others are developing alternate payment network or product that could disintermediate from the transaction processing or the value added service we provide to support such processing example include initiative from the clearing house an association comprised of large financial institution that is developing it own faster payment system and early warning service which operates zelle bank offered alternative network that provides another platform for faster fund or real time payment across variety of payment type including corporate and government disbursement bill pay and deposit check transaction similarly multiple country are developing or promoting real time payment system or mandating local network with client that also present risk of disintermediation to our business competition may increase from alternate type of payment service such mobile payment service ecommerce payment service payment service faster payment initiative and payment service that permit ach or direct debit from consumer checking account party that process our transaction may try to minimize or eliminate our position in the payment value chain party that access our payment credential token and technology including client technology solution provider or others might be able to migrate account holder and other client to alternate payment method or use our payment credential token and technology to establish or help bolster alternate payment method and platform we may need to adjust our local rule and practice to remain competitive amidst evolving regulatory landscape and competitor practice we may be asked to develop or customize certain aspect of our payment service for use by consumer processor or other third party thereby increasing operational cost of content we may need to agree to business arrangement that may be le protective of visa proprietary technology and interest in order to compete and we may face increasing risk of litigation concerning intellectual property more technology company compete with our offering participant in the payment industry may merge form joint venture or enable or enter into other business combination that strengthen their existing business proposition or create new competing payment service this landscape is quickly evolving we may not be able to foresee or respond sufficiently to emerging risk associated with new business product service and practice or new or revised industry standard related to emv chip payment technology cloud based payment tokenization or other technology set by organization such the international organization for standardization american national standard institute and emvco may result in additional cost and expense for visa and it client or otherwise negatively impact the functionality and competitiveness of our product and service our failure to compete effectively in light of any such development could harm our business and prospect for future growth our revenue and profit are dependent on our client and merchant base which may be costly to win retain and maintain our financial institution client and merchant can reassess their commitment to at any time or develop their own competitive service while we have certain contractual protection our client including some of our largest client generally have flexibility to issue non visa product further in certain circumstance our financial institution client may decide to terminate our contractual relationship on relatively short notice without paying significant early termination fee because significant portion of our operating revenue is concentrated among our largest client the loss of business from any one of these larger client could harm our business result of operation and financial condition in order to stay competitive we offer incentive to our client to increase payment volume enter new market segment and expand their use and acceptance of visa product and service these include up front cash payment fee discount rebate credit performance based incentive marketing and other support payment that impact our revenue and profitability in addition we offer incentive to certain merchant or acquirer to win routing preference in situation where other network functionality is enabled on our product and there is choice of network routing option market pressure on providing incentive fee discount and rebate could moderate our growth if we are not able to implement cost containment and productivity initiative in other area of our business or increase our volume in other way to offset the financial impact of these incentive fee discount and rebate it may harm our net revenue and profit in addition it may be difficult or costly for to acquire or conduct business with financial institution or merchant that have longstanding exclusive or nearly exclusive relationship with our competitor these financial institution or merchant may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing client or merchant in addition if there is consolidation or acquisition of one or more of our largest client or co brand partner by financial institution client or merchant with strong relationship with one of our competitor it could result in our business shifting to competitor which could put at competitive disadvantage and harm our business merchant and processor continued push to lower acceptance cost and challenge industry practice could harm our business we rely in part on merchant and their relationship with our client to maintain and expand the acceptance of visa product certain large retail merchant have been exercising their influence in the global payment system in certain jurisdiction such the united state to attempt to lower their acceptance cost by lobbying for new legislation seeking regulatory enforcement filing lawsuit and in some case refusing to accept visa product if they are successful in their effort we may face increased compliance and litigation expense and issuer may decrease their issuance of our product for example in the united state the cost of payment card acceptance ha emerged in the context of payment security number of merchant trade association claim that emv card without pin cardholder verification are not worth the investment the october liability shift and ongoing transition to emv resulted in call for pin verification mandate merchant affiliated group and processor have expressed concern regarding the emv certification process some policymakers have called upon competition authority to consider potential of contentsconcerns arising from the role of industry body such emvco and the payment card industry security standard council additionally some merchant and processor have advocated for change to industry practice and visa acceptance requirement at the point of sale including the ability for merchant to accept only certain type of visa product to mandate only pin authenticated transaction to differentiate or steer among visa product type issued by different financial institution and to impose surcharge on customer presenting visa product their form of payment if successful these effort could adversely impact consumer usage of our product lead to regulatory enforcement and or litigation increase our compliance and litigation expense and harm our business we depend on relationship with our financial institution client acquirer merchant and other third party we depend significantly on relationship with our financial institution client and on their relationship with account holder and merchant to support our program and service and thereby compete effectively in the marketplace our relationship with industry participant are complex and require to balance the interest of multiple third party for example in the united state the emv migration ha been resisted by certain merchant leading to conflict and litigation concerning the timing and scope of the liability shift chargebacks and debit routing among others we engage in discussion with merchant acquirer and processor to provide incentive to promote routing preference and acceptance growth we engage in many payment card co branding effort with merchant who receive incentive from these and other relationship become more prevalent and take on greater importance to our business our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationship in addition we depend on third party including supplier and our financial institution client to provide various service associated with our payment network on our behalf to the extent that such party fail to perform or deliver adequate service our business and reputation could be harmed if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand if event occur that damage our reputation or brand or we experience brand disintermediation it could harm our business our brand are globally recognized and are key asset of our business we believe that our client and account holder associate our brand with acceptance security convenience speed and reliability our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the value of our brand and reputation of our product and service in the payment ecosystem elevate the brand through new and existing product service and partnership and uphold our corporate reputation the increased use or popularity of product that we have developed in partnership with large technology and financial institution company could result in consumer confusion or brand disintermediation and decrease the value of our brand we may not succeed in addressing consumer confusion and brand disintermediation due to the challenge of evolving digital form factor and ecommerce technology our brand and reputation may be negatively impacted by number of factor including data security breach compliance failure negative perception of our industry or the industry of our client action by client or other third party such sponsorship partner that do not reflect our view or are inconsistent with our own business practice and fraudulent controversial or illegal activity using our payment product if we are unable to maintain our reputation our reputation is damaged or any threatened or resulting claim arise result the value of our brand may be impaired which could harm our relationship with client account holder and the public well impact our business global economic political market and social event or condition may harm our business our revenue are dependent on the volume and number of payment transaction made by consumer government and business whose spending pattern may be affected by prevailing economic condition in addition almost half of our operating revenue are earned outside the united state international transaction revenue represent significant part of our revenue and are an important part of our growth strategy therefore adverse macroeconomic condition including recession inflation high unemployment currency fluctuation actual or anticipated large scale default or failure or slowdown of global trade could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer government and corporate spending which have direct impact on our revenue in addition outbreak of illness pandemic or other local or global health issue political uncertainty international hostility armed conflict or unrest and natural disaster could impact our operation our client our activity in particular location and cross border travel and spend geopolitical trend towards nationalism protectionism and restrictive visa requirement well continued activity and uncertainty around economic sanction could also reduce cross border travel and spend any such decline in cross border activity could impact the number of cross border transaction we process and our currency exchange activity which in turn would reduce our international transaction revenue of contentsa decline in economic condition could impact our client well and their decision to reduce the number of card account and credit line of their account holder which ultimately impact our revenue they may also implement cost reduction initiative that reduce or eliminate marketing budget and decrease spending on optional or enhanced value added service from any event or condition that impair the functioning of the financial market tighten the credit market or lead to downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing cost and impair our ability to access the capital and credit market on favorable term which could affect our liquidity and capital resource or significantly increase our cost of capital if client default on their settlement obligation it may also impact our liquidity any of these event could adversely affect the growth of our volume and revenue our indemnification obligation to fund settlement loss of our client expose to significant risk of loss and may reduce our liquidity we indemnify issuer and acquirer for settlement loss they may suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to honor it settlement obligation in accordance with the visa rule in certain instance we may indemnify issuer or acquirer even in situation in which transaction is not processed by our system this indemnification creates settlement risk for due to the timing difference between the date of payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement our indemnification exposure is generally limited to the amount of unsettled visa payment transaction at any point in time and any subsequent amount that may fall due relating to adjustment for previously processed transaction concurrent settlement failure involving more than one of our largest client several of our smaller client or systemic operational failure could negatively impact our financial position even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover settlement failure we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment this could expose to significant loss and harm our business see note settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statement included in item financial statement and supplementary data of this report the united kingdom withdrawal from the european union could harm our business and financial result in june voter in the united kingdom approved the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union commonly referred to brexit in march the uk government initiated the exit process under article of the treaty of the european union commencing period of up to two year for the united kingdom and the other eu member state to negotiate the term of the withdrawal uncertainty over the term of the united kingdom departure from the european union could cause political and economic uncertainty in the united kingdom and the rest of europe which could harm our business and financial result brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national law and regulation in the united kingdom and european union we well our client who have significant operation in the united kingdom may incur additional cost and expense we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory framework from the rest of the european union and result our visa rule and contractual commitment in the united kingdom may be impacted in addition because we conduct business in and have operation in the united kingdom we may need to apply for regulatory authorization and permission in separate eu member state these factor may impact our ability to operate in the european union and united kingdom seamlessly any of these effect of brexit among others could harm our business and financial result technology and cybersecurity risksfailure to anticipate adapt to or keep pace with new technology in the payment industry could harm our business and impact our future growth the global payment industry is undergoing significant and rapid technological change including mobile and other proximity payment and acceptance technology ecommerce tokenization crypto currency new authentication technology including biometrics distributed ledger and blockchain technology and result we expect new service and technology to continue to emerge and evolve in addition to our own initiative and innovation we work closely with third party including some potential competitor for the development of and access to new technology it is difficult however to predict which technological development or innovation will become widely adopted and how these technology may be regulated moreover some of these new technology could be subject to intellectual property related lawsuit or assertion potentially impacting our development effort and or requiring to obtain license if we or our partner fail to adapt or keep pace with new technology in the payment of contentsspace in timely manner it could harm our ability to compete decrease the value of our product and service to our client impact our intellectual property or licensing right and harm our business and impact our future growth failure in or breach of our network or system including result of cyber attack could harm our business our cybersecurity and processing system well those of financial institution merchant and third party service provider may experience damage or disruption from number of cause including power outage computer and telecommunication failure computer virus malware or other destructive software internal design manual or usage error cyber attack terrorism workplace violence or wrongdoing catastrophic event natural disaster and severe weather condition our visibility and role in the global payment industry may also put at greater risk of being targeted by hacker in the normal course of our business we have been the target of malicious cyber attack attempt we may also be impacted by breach of our financial institution client merchant or third party processor for instance several merchant have encountered substantial data breach affecting their customer some of were visa account holder although these merchant breach have not had direct material impact on we believe these incident are likely to continue and we are unable to predict the direct or indirect impact of these future attack to our business in addition numerous and evolving cybersecurity threat including advanced and persistent cyber attack phishing and social engineering scheme particularly on our internet application could compromise the confidentiality availability and integrity of data in our system the security measure and procedure we our client merchant and third party service provider have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data breach cyber attack or system failure although we devote significant resource to our cybersecurity program and have implemented security measure to protect our system and data and to prevent detect and respond to data security incident there can be no assurance that our effort will prevent these threat because the technique used to obtain unauthorized access or to disable or degrade system change frequently have become increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for period of time we may not anticipate these act or respond adequately or timely these threat continue to evolve and increase we may be required to devote significant additional resource in order to modify and enhance our security control and to identify and remediate any security vulnerability if we are sued in connection with any data security breach or system failure we could be involved in protracted litigation if unsuccessful in defending such lawsuit we may have to pay damage or change our business practice any of which could harm our business in addition any reputational damage resulting from data security breach or system failure at one or more of our client merchant or other third party could decrease the use and acceptance of our product which could harm our payment volume revenue and future growth prospect finally breach or failure may also subject visa to additional regulation or governmental or regulatory investigation which could result in significant compliance cost fine or enforcement action or potential restriction imposed by regulator on our ability to process transaction we may experience error interruption delay or cessation of service in our information technology infrastructure and processing system which could significantly disrupt our operation impact our client and consumer damage our reputation result in litigation violation of applicable privacy and other law and regulatory fine or penalty decrease the overall use and acceptance of our product and be costly time consuming and difficult to remedy in the event of damage or disruption to our business due to these occurrence we may not be able to successfully and quickly recover all of our critical business function asset and data through our business continuity program furthermore while we maintain insurance our coverage may not sufficiently cover all type of loss or claim that may arise structural and organizational risksfailure to maintain interoperability with visa europe system during the integration could damage the business and global perception of our brand in june we acquired visa europe while visa europe system are being integrated with our legacy system we will continue to maintain mostly separate authorization clearing and settlement system result we have to ensure that the two system can process every transaction involving both of our territory regardless of where the transaction originates visa europe independent system operation could present challenge to our business in of contentsthe event of increasing cost or difficulty in maintaining the interoperability of our respective system during the integration phase the separation of payment card scheme and processing may also exacerbate this risk any inconsistency in the payment processing service and product between visa europe and our legacy operation could negatively affect the experience of consumer using visa product globally moreover we are beginning the process of migrating european activity onto visanet system in and successfully integrating our system is expected to be time consuming costly and technologically challenging failure to authorize clear and settle inter territory transaction quickly and accurately could harm our business and impair the global perception of our brand we may not achieve the anticipated benefit of our acquisition or strategic investment and may face risk and uncertainty result part of our overall business strategy we may make acquisition and strategic investment for example we believe the acquisition of visa europe position to create additional value through increased scale efficiency realized by the integration of both business and benefit related to visa europe transition from an association to for profit enterprise although there can be no guarantee that we will realize these benefit our current and future acquisition and strategic investment may involve significant risk and uncertainty including disruption to our ongoing business including diversion of resource and management attention from our existing business greater than expected investment of resource or operating expense failure to develop the acquired business adequately difficulty implementing control procedure and policy at the acquired company challenge of integrating new employee business culture business system and technology failure to retain employee client or partner of the acquired business in the case of foreign acquisition risk related to the integration of operation across different culture and

acquisition not materializing we may be unable to attract hire and retain highly qualified and diverse workforce including key management the talent and effort of our employee particularly our key management are vital to our success our management team ha significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace we may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employee particularly if we do not offer employment term that are competitive with the rest of the labor market change in law and policy regarding immigration and work authorization could make it more difficult for employee to work in or transfer among jurisdiction in which we have operation and could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employee failure to attract hire develop motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent or failure to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team could disrupt our operation and adversely affect our business and our future success of contentsthe conversion of our class and class common stock or series and series preferred stock into share of class common stock would result in voting dilution to and could impact the market price of our existing class common stock the market price of our class common stock could fall result of many factor under our retrospective responsibility plan upon final resolution of our covered litigation all class common stock will become convertible into class common stock in connection with the acquisition of visa europe we issued series and series preferred stock which will become convertible into class common stock in stage based on development in current and potential litigation and will become fully convertible no later than subject to holdback to cover any pending claim conversion of our class and class common stock into class common stock or our series and series preferred stock into class common stock would increase the amount of class common stock outstanding which could adversely affect the market price of our existing class common stock and would dilute the voting power of existing class common stockholder holder of our class and common stock and series and series preferred stock may have different interest than our class common stockholder concerning certain significant transaction although their voting right are limited holder of our class and common stock and in certain specified circumstance holder of our series and series preferred stock can vote on certain significant transaction with respect to our class and common stock these transaction include proposed consolidation or merger decision to exit our core payment business and any other vote required under delaware law with respect to our series and series preferred stock voting right are limited to proposed consolidation or merger in which holder of the series and series preferred stock would either receive share of stock or other equity security with preference right and privilege that are not substantially identical to the preference right and privilege of the applicable series of preferred stock or ii receive security cash or other property that is different from our class common stockholder would receive because the holder of class of capital stock other than class common stock are our current and former financial institution

other client and partner under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain type of loss incurred relating to the service we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement contractual obligation our contractual commitment will have an impact on our future liquidity the contractual obligation identified in the table below include both on and off

presented include payment for both interest and principal also see note debt to our consolidated financial statement included in item financial statement and supplementary data of this report represents agreement to purchase good and service that specify significant term including fixed or minimum quantity to be purchased minimum or variable price provision and the approximate timing of the transaction includes operating lease for premise equipment and software license which range in term from le than one year to twenty year future cash payment for long term contract with financial institution client and other business partner is unknowable due to the inherent unpredictability of payment and transaction volume these agreement which range in term from one to sixteen year can provide card issuance and or conversion support volume growth target and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirement these payment amount are our best estimate and will likely change materially based on actual client performance amendment to existing contract or the execution of new contract related amount disclosed in note commitment and contingency to our consolidated financial statement represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreement which are also estimate that will likely change materially due to the same factor described above visa is party to contractual sponsorship agreement ranging from approximately two to sixteen year these contract are designed to increase visa brand recognition drive visa product

associated with our uncertain tax position therefore no amount related to these obligation have been included in the table we evaluate the need to make contribution to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan movement in the discount rate performance of the plan asset and related tax consequence expected contribution to our pension plan have not been included in the table such amount are dependent upon the consideration discussed above and may result in wide range of amount see note pension postretirement and other benefit to our consolidated

item financial statement and supplementary data of this report we have established policy and control procedure which seek to ensure that estimate and assumption are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period however actual result could differ from our assumption and estimate and such difference could be material we believe that the following accounting estimate are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial result they require our most subjective or complex management judgment resulting from the need to make estimate about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable revenue recognition client incentive of contentscritical estimate we enter into incentive agreement with financial institution client merchant and other business partner for various program designed to build payment volume increase visa product acceptance and win merchant routing transaction over our network these incentive are primarily accounted for reduction to operating revenue however if separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established they are accounted for operating expense we generally capitalize advance incentive payment under these agreement if select criterion are met the capitalization criterion include the existence of future economic benefit to visa the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language early termination clause management ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amount deferred capitalized amount are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit incentive not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management estimate of each client performance these accrual are regularly reviewed and estimate of performance are adjusted appropriate based on change in performance expectation actual client performance amendment to existing contract or the execution of new contract assumption and judgment estimation of client incentive relies on forecast of payment volume card issuance and card conversion performance is estimated using client reported information transactional information accumulated from our system historical information and discussion with our client merchant and business partner impact if actual result differ from assumption if actual performance or recoverable cash flow are not consistent with our estimate client incentive may be materially different than initially recorded increase in incentive payment are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume which drive our net revenue result in the event incentive payment exceed estimate such payment are not expected to have material effect on our financial condition result of operation or cash flow the cumulative impact of revision in estimate is recorded in the period such revision become probable and estimable for the year ended september client incentive represented of gross operating revenue legal and regulatory matter critical estimate we are currently involved in various legal proceeding the outcome of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged period of time management is required to ass the probability of loss and amount of such loss if any in preparing our financial statement assumption and judgment we evaluate the likelihood of potential loss from legal or regulatory proceeding to which we are party we record liability for such claim when loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgment are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceeding the merit of our defense and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claim and may revise our estimate our retrospective responsibility plan only address monetary liability from settlement of or final judgment in the covered litigation the plan mechanism include the use of the litigation escrow account the accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance we did not record an accrual for the covered litigation during fiscal our europe retrospective responsibility plan only cover visa europe territory

any other matter see note and europe retrospective responsibility plan and note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item financial statement and supplementary data of this

evaluate and measure all uncertain tax position taken or to be taken on tax return and to record liability for the amount of such position that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority impact if actual result differ from assumption although we believe that our estimate and judgment are reasonable actual result may differ from these estimate some or all of these judgment are subject to review by the taxing authority if one or more of the taxing authority were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit it could have material adverse effect on our financial result and cash flow item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about
