factorsyou should consider each of the following factor in evaluating our business and our prospect any of which could negatively impact our business result of operation cash flow and financial condition and require significant management time and attention further the risk and uncertainty described below are not the only one we face additional risk and uncertainty not presently known to or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business result of operation cash flow and financial condition and require significant management time and attention in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline you should also consider the other information set forth in this annual report in evaluating our business and our prospect including but not limited to our financial statement and the related note and part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation reference to and or and and or should be read to include the others appropriate risk related to our operating businesseswe derive significant portion of our revenue from small number of customer and licensee and particularly from their sale of premium tier device if revenue derived from these customer or licensee decrease or the timing of such revenue fluctuates our business and result of operation could be negatively affected we derive significant portion of our revenue from small number of customer and licensee and particularly from their sale of premium tier device and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future our industry is experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among few company particularly at the premium tier contributing to this trend certain chinese oems continue to grow their device share in china and are increasing their device share in region outside of china and we derive significant portion of our revenue from small number of these oems well see also note to consolidated financial statement note significant accounting policy concentration in addition number of our largest integrated circuit customer have developed are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit product or may choose our competitor integrated circuit product which they have in the past utilized currently utilize and may in the future utilize in some or all of their device rather than our product which could significantly reduce the revenue we derive from these customer see also the risk factor titled our business particularly our semiconductor business may suffer result of our customer vertically integrating developing their own integrated circuit product further political action including trade and or national security protection policy or other action by government particularly the and chinese government have in the past currently are and could in the future limit or prevent from transacting business with certain of our customer limit prevent or discourage those customer from transacting business with or make it more expensive to do so any of which could also significantly reduce the revenue we derive from these customer see also the risk factor titled significant portion of our business is concentrated in china and the risk of such concentration are exacerbated by china trade and national security tension in addition we spend significant amount of engineering and development time fund and resource in understanding our key customer feedback and or specification and attempt to incorporate such input into our product launch and technology these effort may not require or result in purchase commitment from such customer or we may have lower purchase from such customer than expected and consequently we may not achieve the anticipated revenue from these effort or these effort may result in non recoverable cost the loss of any one of our significant customer reduction in the purchase of our product by any of these customer or the cancellation of significant purchase by any of these customer whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit product or our competitor integrated circuit product government restriction decline in global regional or local economic condition decline in consumer demand elevated inventory level at our customer or otherwise would reduce our revenue and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected result of operation delay of significant purchase even if only temporary would reduce our revenue in the period of the delay any such reduction in revenue would also impact our cash resource available for other purpose such research and development further the concentration of device share among few company and the corresponding purchasing power of these company may result in lower price for our product which if not accompanied by sufficient increase in the volume of purchase of our product could have an adverse effect on our revenue and margin in addition the timing and size of purchase by our significant customer may be impacted by the timing of such customer new or next generation product introduction over which we have no control and the timing and success of such introduction may cause our revenue and result of operation to fluctuate apple purchase our mdm or thin modem product which do not include our integrated application processor technology and which have lower revenue and margin contribution than our combined modem and application processor product consequently to the extent apple take device share from our customer purchase our integrated modem and application processor product our revenue and margin may be negatively impacted our industry ha also experienced slowing growth in the premium tier device segment due to among other factor maturing premium tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launch and innovation cycle reduction in sale of premium tier device reduction in sale of our premium tier integrated circuit product which have higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower tier integrated circuit product or shift in share away oems that utilize our premium tier product would reduce our revenue and margin and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial result any such reduction in revenue would also impact our cash resource available for other purpose such research and development further while our product and revenue diversification strategy have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenue coming from outside of mobile handset from industry such automotive and iot certain product category within those industry may in be subject to high level of customer concentration although we have more than licensee we derive significant portion of our licensing revenue from limited number of licensee which includes number of chinese oems in the event that one or more of our significant licensee fail to meet their reporting and payment obligation or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreement under similar term their existing agreement our revenue result of operation and cash flow would be adversely impacted moreover the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensee to develop introduce and deliver high volume product that achieve and sustain customer acceptance we do not have control over the product development sale effort or pricing of product by our licensee and our licensee might not be successful reduction in sale of our licensee product or reduction in the average selling price of wireless device sold by our licensee without sufficient increase in the volume of such device sold would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenue our business particularly our semiconductor business may suffer result of our customer vertically integrating developing their own integrated circuit product certain of our largest integrated circuit customer for example samsung develop their own integrated circuit product which they have in the past utilized and currently utilize in certain of their device and may in the future utilize in some or all of their device rather than our product and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit product to third party discretely or together with certain of their other product in competition with apple ha utilized modem product of one of our competitor in some of it device rather than our product and solely utilized one of our competitor product in several of it prior device launch in december apple acquired intel modem asset and is developing it own modem product using those asset accordingly we expect apple to use it own modem product rather than our product in some or all of it future device similarly we derive significant portion of our revenue from chinese oems certain of our customer in china have developed and others may in the future develop their own integrated circuit product and use such integrated circuit product in their device rather than our integrated circuit product including due to pressure from or policy of the chinese government whose made in china campaign target semiconductor self sufficiency by concern over losing access to our integrated circuit product result of actual threatened or potential or chinese government action or policy including trade protection or national security policy or other reason see also the risk factor titled significant portion of our business is concentrated in china and the risk of such concentration are exacerbated by china trade and national security tension in addition periodic supply capacity constraint within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our integrated circuit customer to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chain if some or all of our largest customer and or the largest smartphone oems utilize their own integrated circuit modem product in some or all of their device rather than our product our business revenue result of operation cash flow and financial position could be materially adversely impacted see also the risk factor titled we derive significant portion of our revenue from small number of customer and licensee and particularly from their sale of premium tier device if revenue derived from these customer or licensee decrease or the timing of such revenue fluctuates our business and result of operation could be negatively affected significant portion of our business is concentrated in china and the risk of such concentration are exacerbated by china trade and national security tension we derive significant portion of our revenue from chinese oems and from non chinese oems that utilize our integrated circuit product in their device and sell those device into china which ha the largest number of smartphone user in the world we also source certain critical integrated circuit product from supplier in china due to various factor including pressure encouragement or incentive from or policy of the chinese government including it made in china campaign concern over losing access to our integrated circuit product result of actual threatened or potential or chinese government action or policy including trade protection or national security policy or other reason some of our chinese integrated circuit customer have developed and others may in the future develop their own integrated circuit product and use such integrated circuit product in their device or use our competitor integrated circuit product in their device rather than our product which could materially harm our business revenue result of operation cash flow and financial position see also the risk factor titled our business particularly our semiconductor business may suffer result of our customer vertically integrating developing their own integrated circuit product political action including trade protection and national security policy of the and chinese government such tariff ban or placing company on restricted entity list have in the past currently are and could in the future limit or from transacting business with certain of our chinese customer or supplier limit prevent or discourage certain of our chinese customer or supplier from transacting business with or make it more expensive to do so given our revenue concentration in china if due to actual threatened or potential or chinese government action or policy we were further limited in or prohibited from selling our integrated circuit product to chinese oems our non chinese oem customer were limited in or prohibited from selling device into china that incorporate our integrated circuit product chinese oems develop and use their own integrated circuit product or use our competitor integrated circuit product in some or all of their device rather than our integrated circuit product chinese tariff on our integrated circuit product or on device which incorporate our integrated circuit product made purchasing such product or device more expensive to chinese oems or chinese consumer or our chinese licensee delay or cease making payment of license fee they owe our business revenue result of operation cash flow and financial position could be materially harmed similarly if due to or chinese government action or policy we were limited in or prohibited from obtaining critical integrated circuit product from our supplier in china our business revenue result of operation cash flow and financial position could be materially harmed see also the risk factor titled we derive significant portion of our revenue from small number of customer and licensee and particularly from their sale of premium tier device if revenue derived from these customer or licensee decrease or the timing of such revenue fluctuates our business and result of operation could be negatively affected finally government policy in china that regulate the amount and timing of fund that may flow out of the country have impacted and may continue to impact the timing of our receipt of and or ability to receive payment from our customer and licensee in china which may negatively impact our cash flow risk related to new initiativesour growth depends in part on our ability to extend our technology and product into new and expanded product area and industry and application beyond mobile handset our research development and other investment in these new and expanded product area industry and application and related technology and product well in our existing technology and product and new technology may not generate operating income or contribute to future result of operation that meet our expectation while we continue to invest significant resource toward advancement primarily in support based technology we also invest in new and expanded product area and industry and application beyond mobile handset by utilizing our existing technical and business expertise and through acquisition or other strategic transaction in particular our future growth depends in part on new and expanded product area and industry and application beyond mobile handset such automotive and iot our ability to develop leading and cost effective technology and product for these new and expanded product area industry and application and third party incorporating our technology and product into device used in these product area industry and application accordingly we intend to continue to make substantial investment in these new and expanded product area industry and application and in developing new product and technology for these product area industry and application our growth also depends significantly on our ability to develop and patent technology and to develop and commercialize product using technology however our research development and other investment in these new and expanded product area industry and application and corresponding technology and product well in our existing technology and product and new technology in mobile handset may not succeed among other reason we may not be issued patent on the technology we develop the technology we develop may not be incorporated into relevant standard new and expanded product area industry and application beyond mobile handset and consumer demand therein may not develop or grow anticipated we may be unable to attract or retain employee with the necessary skill in such new and expanded product area industry and application our strategy or the strategy of our customer licensee or partner may not be successful alternate technology or product may be better or may reduce the advantage we anticipate from our investment competitor technology or product may be more cost effective have more capability or fewer limitation or be brought to market faster than our new technology or product we may not be able to develop or our competitor may have more established and or stronger customer vendor distributor or other channel relationship and competitor may have longer operating history in industry and application that are new to we may also underestimate the cost of or overestimate the future revenue or margin that could result from these investment and these investment may not or may take many year to generate material return further the automotive industry is subject to long design in time frame long product life cycle and high degree of regulatory and safety requirement necessitating supplier to the industry to comply with stringent qualification process very low defect rate and high reliability standard all of which result in significant barrier to entry and increased cost if our product fail to perform to specification compete with the product quality of our competitor or meet quality and or regulatory standard of particular industry or application including product safety and information security standard which may differ by region geography and industry and which are particularly stringent in the automotive industry we may be unable to successfully expand our business in that industry or application and our growth could be limited in addition in order to successfully extend our technology and product into new and expanded product area and industry and application beyond mobile handset we may need to transition to new business model and transform aspect of our organization and we may not be successful in so we are not successful in extending our technology and product into new and expanded product area and industry and application beyond mobile handset if our new technology and product are not successful or if we are not successful in the time frame we anticipate we may incur significant cost and asset impairment our business and revenue may not grow or grow anticipated our revenue and margin may be negatively impacted our stock price may decline and our reputation may be harmed we may engage in acquisition and other strategic transaction or make investment or be unable to consummate planned strategic acquisition which could adversely affect our result of operation or fail to enhance stockholder value we engage in acquisition and other strategic transaction including joint venture and make investment which we believe are important to the future of our business with the goal of maximizing stockholder value we routinely acquire business and other asset including patent technology and other intangible asset enter into joint venture or other strategic transaction and purchase minority equity interest in or make loan to company including those that may be private and early stage our strategic activity are generally focused on opening or expanding opportunity for our product and technology and supporting the design and introduction of new product or enhancing existing product for mobile handset and for industry and application beyond mobile handset many of our strategic activity entail high degree of risk and require the use of significant amount of capital and investment may not become liquid for several year after the date of the investment if at all our strategic activity may not be successful generate financial return or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technology or product we may underestimate the cost or overestimate the benefit including product revenue cost and other synergy and growth opportunity that we expect to realize and we may not achieve those benefit in some case we may be required to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or loss of company in which we have acquired ownership or variable interest in addition we have in the past recorded and may in the future record impairment or other charge related to our strategic activity any loss or impairment charge that we incur related to strategic activity will have negative impact on our result of operation and financial condition and we may continue to incur new or additional loss related to strategic asset or investment that we have not fully impaired or exited achieving the anticipated benefit of business acquisition depends in part upon our ability to integrate the business in an efficient and effective manner and achieve anticipated synergy and we may not be successful in these effort such integration is complex and time consuming and involves significant challenge including among others retaining key employee successfully integrating new employee facility technology product process operation including supply and manufacturing operation sale and distribution channel business model and business system retaining customer and supplier of the business consolidating research and development operation minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business matter consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructure and managing the increased scale complexity and globalization of our business operation and employee base we may not derive any commercial value from associated technology or product or from future technology or product based on these technology and we may be subject to liability that are not covered by indemnification protection that we may obtain and we may become subject to litigation additionally we may not be successful in entering or expanding into new sale or distribution channel business or operational model geographic region industry and application served by or adjacent to the associated business or in addressing potential new opportunity that may arise out of our strategic acquisition if we do not achieve the anticipated benefit of business acquisition or other strategic activity our business and result of operation may be adversely affected and we may not enhance stockholder value by engaging in these transaction many of our acquisition and other strategic investment require approval by the united state and or foreign government agency certain agency in the past have and may in the future deny the transaction or fail to approve in timely manner resulting in not realizing the anticipated benefit of the proposed transaction future acquisition or other strategic investment may be more difficult complex or expensive to the extent that our reputation for our ability to consummate acquisition ha been or is in the future harmed further if china relation remain strained our ability to consummate any transaction that would require approval from the relevant regulatory agency in china may be severely impacted in addition acquisition that we have completed could subsequently be reviewed and or challenged by government agency which could result in fine penalty or other liability or requirement to divest all or portion of an acquired business risk related to supply and manufacturingwe depend on limited number of third party supplier for the procurement manufacture assembly and testing of our product manufactured in fable production model if we fail to execute supply strategy that provide supply assurance technology leadership and reasonable margin our business and result of operation may be harmed we are also subject to order and shipment uncertainty that could negatively impact our result of operation we primarily utilize fable production model which mean that we do not own or operate foundry for the production of silicon wafer from which our integrated circuit are made other than the facility we own that manufacture certain of our rffe module and rf radio frequency filter product we rely on third party supplier to perform the manufacturing and assembly and most of the testing of our integrated circuit our supplier are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw material used in the production of our integrated circuit there are limited number of such third party supplier and even fewer who are capable of manufacturing at the leading process technology node or who are willing to operate at older process technology node necessary for certain of our integrated circuit product the semiconductor manufacturing that supply our product are primarily located in asia are the primary warehouse where we store finished good for fulfillment of customer order the following issue related to our third party supplier could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and negatively impact our revenue business operation profitability and cash flow our supplier failure or inability to react to shift in product demand including situation where demand for integrated circuit exceeds supplier capacity to meet that demand failure or inability by our supplier to procure raw material or allocate adequate raw material for our product or an increase in price for raw material or component an inability to procure or utilize raw material component or product from our supplier due to government prohibition or restriction on transaction with certain country and or company and alternative supplier raw material source or raw material are not available or not available in acceptable time frame or upon acceptable term failure by our supplier to allocate adequate manufacturing assembly or test capacity for our product our supplier failure or inability to develop or maintain or delay in developing or building out manufacturing capacity for leading process technology including transition to smaller geometry process technology the loss of supplier or the failure or inability of supplier to meet performance quality or yield specification or delivery schedule additional expense or production delay result of qualifying new supplier and commencing volume production or testing in the event of loss of or decision to add or change supplier natural disaster the effect of climate change act of war or other geopolitical conflict impacting the region in which our supplier and their manufacturing foundry or assembly test or other facility are located health crisis including epidemic or pandemic such the covid pandemic and government and business response thereto which impact our supplier including result of quarantine or closure cyber attack on our supplier information technology it system including those related to their manufacturing foundry or assembly test or other facility trade or national security protection policy particularly or chinese government policy that limit or prevent from transacting business with supplier of critical integrated circuit product or that limit or prevent such supplier from transacting business with or from procuring material machinery or technology necessary to manufacture good for and any other reduction interruption delay or limitation in our product supply source we rely on sole or limited source supplier for certain product which may exacerbate the risk identified above and subject to other significant risk including poor product performance and reduced control over delivery schedule manufacturing capability and yield quality assurance quantity and cost while we have established and may in the future establish alternate supplier for certain product these supplier may require significant amount of time and level of support to bring such product to production both of which may increase for complex or leading process technology result we may invest significant amount of effort and resource and incur higher cost to support and maintain such alternate supplier further the elimination or limitation of foundry supplier ability to manufacture component or product for due to trade or national security protection policy could increase our vulnerability to sole or limited source arrangement and limit or prevent from procuring critical component or product from those supplier future consolidation of foundry supplier could also increase our vulnerability to sole or limited source arrangement and reduce our supplier willingness to negotiate pricing which could negatively impact our ability to achieve cost reduction increase our manufacturing cost and limit the amount of capacity available to our arrangement with our supplier may obligate to incur cost to manufacture assemble and test our product that do not decrease at the same rate decrease in pricing to our customer our ability and that of our supplier to develop or maintain leading process technology including transition to smaller geometry process technology which add risk to manufacturing yield and reliability and to effectively compete with the manufacturing process and performance of our competitor could impact our ability to introduce new product and meet customer demand could increase our cost possibly decreasing our margin and could subject to the risk of excess inventory any of the above could negatively impact our business result of operation and cash flow although we have long term contract with our supplier some of these contract do not provide for long term capacity commitment to the extent we do not have firm commitment from our supplier over specific time period or for any specific quantity our supplier may allocate and in the past have allocated capacity to the manufacture assembly and testing of product for their other customer including our competitor while reducing or limiting capacity to manufacture assemble or test our product and such capacity may be limited based on our supplier ability and willingness to invest in the capital required to manufacture in the leading process technology our supplier or potential alternate supplier may also manufacture their own integrated circuit that compete with our product such supplier have in the past allocated and may allocate raw material and manufacturing capacity to their own product and reduce or limit the production of our to the extent we do obtain long term capacity commitment we may incur additional cost related to those commitment or make non refundable payment for capacity commitment that are not used further certain of our supplier have in the past attempted and may in the future attempt to unilaterally reduce their capacity commitment to accordingly capacity for our product may not be available when we need it finally we may not receive reasonable pricing manufacturing or delivery term from our supplier and our ability to obtain favorable term may be diminished during time of high demand and or limited manufacturing capacity for integrated circuit product we can not guarantee that the action of our supplier will not cause disruption in our operation that could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligation to our customer or increase our cost of sale to the extent we are unable to obtain adequate supply to meet our delivery obligation we may be obligated to make payment to our customer for such shortfall recently the global semiconductor industry experienced demand for integrated circuit that exceeded the industry capacity to meet that demand our ability to meet increased demand for our product ha been and may in the future be limited due to the inability to obtain the additional manufacturing assembly and test capacity necessary to fully meet such demand if we are unable to fully meet customer demand this could result in lost sale opportunity reduced revenue growth and harm to our customer relationship these issue may be exacerbated if customer overstate their expected demand requirement in order to procure additional supply which could negatively impact our ability to forecast and to allocate supply appropriately among our customer the above issue may also be exacerbated with respect to our platform solution which already entail great deal of complexity due to differing lead time technology and supplier for each integrated circuit product included in such solution additionally our supplier have in the past and may in the future increase their price during period of capacity constraint or for other reason thus increasing our cost while capacity constraint have largely abated we continue to see price increase from certain of our key semiconductor manufacturing supplier which without corresponding increase in the price of our product would negatively impact our margin we place order with our supplier using our and our customer forecast of demand for our product which are based on number of assumption and estimate we move to smaller geometry process technology the manufacturing lead time increase result the order we place with our supplier are generally only partially covered by commitment from our customer if we or our customer overestimate demand or if demand is impacted by factor outside of our or our customer control and such demand is not covered by binding commitment from our customer we may experience increased excess or obsolete inventory or reserve charge which would negatively impact our result of operation further to the extent our customer procure supply of our integrated circuit product beyond their current need build up inventory of our integrated circuit product whether due to concern over supply overestimating demand and or decline in macroeconomic condition or otherwise they may not purchase expected quantity of our product in subsequent quarter which may negatively impact our revenue result of operation and cash flow in such quarter see also the risk factor below titled there are numerous risk associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facility including higher portion of fixed cost relative to fable model environmental compliance and liability impact related to climate change exposure to natural disaster health crisis geopolitical conflict and cyber attack timely supply of equipment and material and various manufacturing issue similar risk well additional risk may be applicable to our third party supplier manufacturing facility which could result in disruption to our business or additional cost to and negatively impact our result of operation there are numerous risk associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facility including higher portion of fixed cost relative to fable model environmental compliance and liability impact related to climate change exposure to natural disaster health crisis geopolitical conflict and cyber attack timely supply of equipment and material and various manufacturing issue we operate various facility that manufacture certain of our rffe module and rf filter product our manufacturing facility are characterized by higher portion of fixed cost relative to fable model we may be faced with decline in the utilization rate of our manufacturing facility due to decrease in demand for our product including in le favorable industry or macroeconomic environment or due to our failure to win and or retain design with oems result from time to time our manufacturing facility operate at lower capacity level while the fixed cost associated with such facility continue to be incurred resulting in lower gross profit due to the factor above we are currently experiencing and expect to continue to experience in the near term such underutilization of capacity at our manufacturing facility we are subject to many complex environmental health and safety law regulation and rule in each jurisdiction in which we operate our manufacturing and research and development facility the regulatory landscape in these area continues to evolve and we anticipate additional law regulation and rule in the future in particular new or change in environmental and climate change law regulation or rule including relating to greenhouse gas emission could lead to new or additional investment in production process and could increase environmental compliance expenditure in addition certain environmental law impose strict and in certain circumstance joint and several liability on current or previous owner or operator of real property or party who arranged for hazardous substance to be sent to disposal or treatment facility for the cost of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substance result we may incur clean up cost in connection with any such removal or remediation effort well other third party claim in connection with contaminated site in addition we could be held liable for consequence arising out of human exposure to hazardous substance or other environmental damage if we or company or facility we acquire or have acquired in the past failed or in the future fail to comply with any such law and regulation we could incur regulatory penalty fine and legal suspension of production significant compliance requirement alteration of our manufacturing assembly or test process restriction on our ability to modify or expand our facility damage to our reputation and restriction on our operation or sale we are also required to obtain and maintain environmental permit from governmental authority for certain of our operation we can not make assurance that we will at all time be in compliance with such law regulation rule and permit see also the risk factor titled our business may suffer due to the impact of or our failure to comply with the various existing new or amended law regulation policy or standard to which we are subject climate change concern and the potential resulting environmental impact may result in new environmental health and safety law and regulation that may affect our supplier and our customer such law or regulation could cause to incur additional direct cost for compliance including cost associated with change to manufacturing process or the procurement of raw material used in manufacturing process well increased indirect cost resulting from our customer supplier or both incurring additional compliance cost that are passed on to these cost may adversely impact our result of operation and financial condition in addition climate change could cause certain natural disaster such drought wildfire storm flooding or rising sea level to occur more frequently or with greater intensity which could pose physical risk to our manufacturing facility or our supplier facility could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of such facility and could increase or decrease temperature resulting in increased operating cost and or business disruption we have manufacturing facility in asia and europe and the primary warehouse where we store finished good are located in asia if tsunami flooding earthquake volcanic eruption drought or other natural disaster effect of climate change act of war or other geopolitical conflict were to damage destroy or disrupt any of these facility it could disrupt our operation cease or delay production and shipment of inventory and result in costly repair replacement or other cost and lost business in addition natural disaster effect of climate change act of war or other geopolitical conflict may result in disruption in transportation distribution channel and supply chain and significant increase in the price of raw material further health crisis including epidemic or pandemic such the covid pandemic and government and business response thereto could affect our manufacturing facility including by resulting in quarantine and or closure which would result in disruption to and potential closure of our manufacturing operation our manufacturing operation could also be disrupted by cyber attack on our it system described in the risk factor below titled our business and operation could suffer in the event of security breach of our it system or other misappropriation of our technology intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information our manufacturing operation depend on securing raw material equipment and other supply in adequate quality and quantity in timely manner from multiple supplier and in some case we rely on limited number of supplier including in some case sole supplier particularly in asia there may be case where supply of raw material equipment and other product are interrupted or limited by natural disaster geopolitical conflict accident or some other event affecting supplier or source of raw material supply is suspended due to quality or other issue there is shortage of supply due to rapid increase in demand and or we or our supplier are prohibited from utilizing certain raw material or product or component that incorporate such raw material due to government restriction related to the country from which such raw material originate and acceptable alternative supplier raw material or raw material source are not available or not available in acceptable time frame or upon acceptable term among others which could impact production and prevent from supplying our product to our customer if the supply demand balance is disrupted it may considerably increase cost of manufacturing due to increased price we pay for raw material from time to time supplier may extend lead time limit amount supplied to or increase price due to capacity constraint or other factor additionally supply and cost of raw material equipment and other product may be negatively impacted by trade and or national security protection policy such tariff or action by government that limit or prevent from transacting business with certain country or company or that limit or prevent certain company from transacting business with or trade tension particularly with country in asia further it may be difficult or impossible to substitute one piece of equipment for another or replace one type of material with another failure by our supplier to deliver our requirement could result in disruption to our manufacturing operation our manufacturing process are highly complex require advanced and costly equipment and must be continuously modified to improve yield and performance difficulty in the production process can reduce yield or interrupt production and result we may not be able to deliver our product or do so in timely cost effective or competitive manner further to remain competitive and meet customer demand we may be required to improve our facility and process technology and carry out extensive research and development each of which may require investment of significant amount of capital and may have material adverse effect on our result of operation cash flow and financial condition from time to time we begin to purchase equipment to meet expected customer demand in advance of any purchase order or long term purchase commitment further we typically begin manufacturing our product using our or our customer forecast of demand for our product which are based on number of assumption and estimate and may not be covered by long term purchase commitment result we may incur increased inventory and manufacturing cost and or record impairment charge to the extent anticipated sale ultimately do not materialize or are lower than expected if we or our customer overestimate demand or if demand is impacted by factor outside of our or our customer control and such demand is not covered by binding commitment from our customer we may experience higher inventory carrying and operating cost and or increased excess or obsolete inventory or reserve charge which would negatively impact our result of operation related to cybersecurity or misappropriation of our critical information our business and operation could suffer in the event of security breach of our it system or other misappropriation of our technology intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information third party regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to our it system and many such attack are increasingly more sophisticated these attack which might be related to industrial corporate or other espionage criminal hacker or state sponsored intrusion include trying to covertly introduce malware to our computer and network including those in our manufacturing operation exploiting vulnerability in hardware software or other it infrastructure and impersonating authorized user among others we are also subject to ransom style cyber attack which could expose our confidential or proprietary information request payment of money and or impact our it system and cause widespread disruption to our business including our manufacturing operation third party that store and or process our confidential information or that provide product software or service used in our it infrastructure including application may be subject to similar attack which could also result in malware being introduced into our it infrastructure through the third party software and or software update such attack could result in the misappropriation theft misuse disclosure loss or destruction of the technology intellectual property or the proprietary confidential or personal information of or our employee customer licensee supplier or other third party well damage to or disruption in our it system we believe that we have robust cybersecurity program that is aligned to international cybersecurity framework and that we leverage industry best practice across people process and technology in an attempt to mitigate cybersecurity threat however we can not anticipate detect repel or implement fully effective preventative measure against all cybersecurity threat particularly because the technique used are increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving part of our cybersecurity program we seek to identify and remediate vulnerability in our it system and software including third party software used in our it system that could be exploited by hacker or other malicious actor however we may not be aware of all such vulnerability and we may fail to identify and or remediate such vulnerability they are exploited attempt to gain unauthorized access to our it system or other attack have in the past in certain instance and to certain degree been successful but have not caused significant harm and may in the future be successful and in some case we might be unaware of an incident or it magnitude and effect in addition employee and former employee in particular former employee who become employee of our competitor customer licensee or other third party including state actor have in the past and may in the future misappropriate wrongfully use publish or provide to our competitor customer licensee or other third party including state actor our technology intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information this risk is exacerbated competitor for talent particularly engineering talent increasingly attempt to hire our employee see also the risk factor titled we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employee and our attempt to operate under hybrid work model may not be successful similarly we provide access to certain of our technology intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information to our direct and indirect customer and licensee and certain of our consultant who have in the past and may in the future wrongfully use such technology intellectual property or information or wrongfully disclose such technology intellectual property or information to third party including our competitor or state actor we also provide access to certain of our technology intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information to certain of our joint venture partner including those affiliated with state actor and including in foreign jurisdiction where ownership restriction may require to take minority ownership interest in the joint venture such joint venture partner may wrongfully use such technology intellectual property or information or wrongfully disclose such technology intellectual property or information to third party including our competitor or state actor our technology intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information that we have provided to customer licensee or other business partner could also be wrongfully obtained by third party through cyber attack on such customer licensee or other business partner it system the misappropriation theft misuse disclosure loss or destruction of the technology intellectual property or the proprietary confidential or personal information of or our employee customer licensee supplier or other third party could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiative cause to lose business damage our reputation subject to legal or regulatory proceeding cause to incur other loss or liability and otherwise adversely affect our business we expect to continue to devote significant resource to the security of our it system and our technology intellectual property and proprietary and confidential information further china ha implemented and other country or region may implement cybersecurity law that require our overall it security environment to meet certain standard and or be certified such law may be complex ambiguous and subject to interpretation which may create uncertainty regarding compliance result our effort to comply with such law may be expensive and may fail which could adversely affect our business result of operation and cash flow in addition our contract with certain of our customer require to obtain cybersecurity certification for our it system failure to obtain or maintain the necessary cybersecurity certification could result in loss of future revenue damage to our customer relationship and reputation and shift of business to our competitor related to human capital managementwe may not be able to attract and retain qualified employee and our attempt to operate under hybrid work model may not be successful our future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officer and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to identify attract retain and motivate them implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent our revenue are highly dependent on technological and product innovation in addition in order to extend our business into certain new and expanded product area and industry and application beyond mobile handset we need to attract retain and motivate engineering and other technical personnel with specialized skill in these area and these skill are in high demand among our competitor the market for employee in our industry is extremely competitive and competitor for talent particularly engineering talent increasingly attempt to hire and to varying degree have been successful in hiring our employee or employment candidate including by establishing or expanding local office near our headquarters in san diego california further the increased availability of remote working arrangement ha expanded the pool of company that can compete for our employee and employment candidate number of such competitor for talent are significantly larger than and or offer compensation in excess of what we offer or other benefit that we generally do not offer such the ability to permanently work from home further existing immigration law make it more difficult for to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduate of university in the united state making the pool of available talent even smaller if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employee our business may be harmed the covid pandemic caused to modify our workforce practice including the vast majority of our employee work from home while we have generally reopened our office we are currently operating under hybrid work model meaning that the majority of our employee have the flexibility to work remotely at least some of the time the hybrid work model may impair our ability to maintain our collaborative and innovative culture and may cause disruption among our employee including decrease in productivity challenge in communication between on site and off site employee and potentially employee dissatisfaction and attrition further any future attempt to transition away from the hybrid work model to more stringent on site work requirement may result in employee dissatisfaction and attrition if we fail to retain key employee or maintain employee productivity result of the hybrid work model or an attempt to return to more on site work our business could be adversely impacted risk specific to our licensing businessthe continued and future success of our licensing program requires to continue to evolve our patent portfolio and to renew or renegotiate license agreement that are expiring we own very strong portfolio of issued and pending patent related to and other technology it is critical that we continue to evolve our patent portfolio particularly in if we do not maintain strong portfolio that is applicable to current and future standard product and service our future licensing revenue could be negatively impacted our patent license agreement in effect that generate significant portion of our licensing revenue are effective for specified term to receive royalty after the expiration date of the specified term we will need to extend or modify such license agreement or enter into new license agreement with such licensee we might not be able to extend or modify license agreement or enter into new license agreement in the future without negatively affecting the material term and condition of our license agreement with such licensee and such modification or new agreement may negatively impact our revenue in some circumstance we may extend modify or enter into new license agreement result of arbitration or litigation and term imposed by arbitrator or court may be le favorable to than existing term and may impact the financial or other term of license agreement not subject to the litigation or arbitration if there is delay in extending modifying or entering into new license agreement with licensee there would be delay in our ability to recognize revenue related to that licensee product sale further if we are unable to reach agreement on such modification or new agreement it could result in patent infringement litigation with such licensee effort by some original equipment manufacturer oems to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalty for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resource and may result in legal decision or action by government court regulator or agency standard development organization sdos or other industry organization that harm our business from time to time company initiate various strategy to attempt to negotiate renegotiate reduce and or eliminate their need to pay royalty to for the use of our intellectual property these strategy have included litigation often alleging infringement of patent held by such company patent misuse patent exhaustion patent invalidity or unenforceability of our patent or license alleging that we do not license our patent on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory frand term or alleging some form of unfair competition or competition law violation ii taking position contrary to our understanding and or the plain language of their contract with iii appeal to governmental authority iv collective action including working with wireless operator standard body other like minded company and organization on both formal and informal base to adopt intellectual property policy and practice that could have the effect of limiting return on intellectual property innovation lobbying governmental regulator and elected official for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rate or the base on which royalty are calculated seeking to impose some form of compulsory licensing or weakening patent holder ability to enforce it right or obtain fair return for such right and vi attempt by licensee to shift their royalty obligation to their supplier in order to lower the wholesale licensee selling price on which the royalty is calculated addition certain licensee have disputed underreported underpaid not reported or not paid royalty owed to under their license agreement or reported to in manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligation and certain company have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreement with for their use of our intellectual property and they or others may engage in such behavior in the future the fact that one or more licensee dispute underreport underpay do not report or do not pay royalty owed to may encourage other licensee to take similar action or not renew their existing license agreement and may encourage other licensee or unlicensed company to delay entering into or to not enter into new license agreement further to the extent such licensee and company increase their device share the negative impact of their underreporting underpayment non payment or non reporting on our business revenue result of operation cash flow and financial condition will be exacerbated we have been in the past and are currently subject to various litigation and or governmental investigation and proceeding certain of these matter are described in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency we may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigation or proceeding in the future additionally certain of our direct and indirect customer and licensee have pursued and others may in the future pursue litigation or arbitration against related to our business unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matter have had and could in the future have material adverse effect on our business revenue result of operation cash flow and financial condition see also the risk factor below titled change in our patent licensing practice whether due to governmental investigation legal challenge or otherwise could adversely impact our business and result of operation and our business may suffer result of adverse ruling in governmental investigation or proceeding or other legal proceeding in addition in connection with our participation in sdos we like other patent owner generally have made contractual commitment to such organization to license those of our patent that would necessarily be infringed by standard compliant product set forth in those commitment referred to standard essential patent some manufacturer and user of standard compliant product advance interpretation of these commitment that are adverse to our licensing business including interpretation that would limit the amount of royalty that we could collect on the licensing of our standard essential patent portfolio further some third party have proposed significant change to existing intellectual property policy for implementation by sdos and other industry organization with the goal of significantly devaluing standard essential patent for example some have put forth proposal which would require maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard essential patent owned by all of the member company to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard they have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard essential patent based upon the number of standard essential patent held by such company others have proposed that injunction should not be an available remedy for infringement of standard essential patent and have made proposal that could severely limit damage award and other remedy by court for patent infringement by limiting the base upon which the royalty rate may be applied number of these strategy are purportedly based on interpretation of the policy of certain sdos concerning the licensing of patent that are or may be essential to industry standard and on our or other company alleged failure to abide by these policy some sdos court and governmental agency have adopted and may in the future adopt some or all of these interpretation or proposal in manner adverse to our interest including in litigation to which we may not be party further sdos in certain country may attempt to modify widely accepted standard and claim the resulting standard their own we expect that such proposal interpretation and strategy will continue in the future and if successful our business model would be harmed either by limiting or eliminating our ability to collect royalty or by reducing the royalty we can collect on all or portion of our standard essential patent portfolio limiting our return on investment with respect to new technology limiting our ability to seek injunction against infringers of our standard essential patent constraining our ability to make licensing commitment when submitting our technology for inclusion in future standard which could make our technology le likely to be included in such standard or forcing to work outside of sdos or other industry group to promote our new technology and our revenue result of operation and cash flow could be negatively impacted in addition the legal and other cost associated with asserting or defending our position have been and may in the future be significant we expect that such challenge regardless of their merit will continue into the foreseeable future and will require the investment of substantial management time and financial resource change in our patent licensing practice whether due to governmental investigation legal challenge or otherwise could adversely impact our business and result of operation described in the risk factor below titled our business may suffer result of adverse ruling in governmental investigation or proceeding or other legal proceeding we have been in the past currently are and may in the future be subject to various governmental investigation and or legal proceeding challenging our patent licensing practice certain of these matter are described in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency we believe that one intent of certain of these governmental investigation and legal proceeding ha been to reduce the amount of royalty that licensee are required to pay to for their use of our intellectual property if we were required to reduce the royalty rate in our patent license agreement our revenue earnings and cash flow would be negatively impacted absent sufficient increase in the volume of sale of device upon which royalty are paid if we were required to reduce the base on which our royalty are calculated license at the chipset level rather than at the device level our revenue earnings and cash flow would be negatively impacted unless there wa sufficient increase in the volume of sale of device upon which royalty are paid or we were able to increase our royalty rate to offset the decrease in revenue resulting from such lower royalty base assuming the absolute royalty dollar were below any relevant royalty cap if we were required to grant patent license to chipset manufacturer which could lead to implementing more complex multi level licensing structure in which we license certain portion of our patent portfolio to chipset manufacturer and other portion to oems we would incur additional transaction cost which may be significant and we could incur delay in recognizing revenue license negotiation were completed in addition our licensing revenue and earnings would be negatively impacted if we were not able to obtain in the aggregate equivalent revenue under such multi level licensing structure if we were required to sell chipsets to oems that do not have license to our patent our licensing program could be negatively impacted by patent exhaustion claim raised by such unlicensed oems claim that our sale of chipsets to such oems forecloses from asserting any patent substantially embodied by the chipsets against such oems such sale could provide oems with defense in the event we asserted our patent against them to obtain licensing revenue for those patent this could have material adverse effect on our licensing program and our result of operation cash flow and financial condition to the extent that we were required to implement any of these licensing and or business practice including by modifying or renegotiating our existing license agreement or pursuing other commercial arrangement we would incur additional transaction cost which may be significant we could incur delay in recognizing revenue until license negotiation were completed and our business revenue result of operation cash flow and financial condition could be harmed the impact of any such change to our licensing practice could vary widely and by jurisdiction depending on the specific outcome and the geographic scope of such outcome in addition if we were required to make modification to our licensing practice in one jurisdiction licensee or governmental agency in other jurisdiction may attempt to obtain similar outcome for themselves or for such other jurisdiction applicable which could result in increased legal cost and further harm to our business revenue result of operation cash flow and financial condition risk related to regulatory and legal challengesour business may suffer result of adverse ruling in governmental investigation or proceeding or other legal proceeding we have been in the past and currently are subject to various governmental investigation and proceeding certain of these matter are described in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency key allegation or finding in those matter include or have in the past included among others that we violate frand licensing commitment by refusing to grant license to chipset manufacturer that our royalty rate are high that the base on which our royalty are calculated should be something le than the wholesale licensee selling price of the applicable device minus certain permitted deduction that we unlawfully require customer to execute patent license before we sell them cellular modem chipsets that we have entered into exclusive agreement with chipset customer that foreclose competition that we leverage our position in baseband chipsets in the rffe space and that we violate antitrust law and engage in anticompetitive conduct and unfair method of competition we may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigation or proceeding in the future unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matter have had and could in the future have material adverse effect on our business revenue result of operation cash flow and financial condition depending on the matter various remedy that could result from an unfavorable resolution include among others the loss of our ability to enforce one or more of our patent injunction monetary damage fine or other order to pay money the issuance of order to cease certain conduct or modify our business practice such requiring to reduce our royalty rate reduce the base on which our royalty are calculated grant patent license to chipset manufacturer sell chipsets to unlicensed oems or modify or renegotiate some or all of our existing license agreement and determination that some or all of our license agreement are invalid or unenforceable in addition governmental body in particular country or region may successfully assert and impose remedy with effect that extend beyond the border of that country or region if some or all of our license agreement are declared invalid or unenforceable and or we are required to renegotiate these license agreement we may not receive or may not be able to recognize some or any licensing or royalty revenue under the impacted license agreement unless and until we enter into new license agreement and even licensee whose license agreement are not impacted may demand to renegotiate their agreement or invoke the dispute resolution provision in their agreement and we may not be able to recognize some or any revenue under such agreement the renegotiation of license agreement could result in term that are le favorable to than existing term or lead to arbitration or litigation to resolve the licensing term which could also be le favorable to than existing term and each of which could take month or year licensee may underreport underpay not report or not pay royalty owed to pending the conclusion of such negotiation arbitration or litigation in addition we may be sued for alleged overpayment of past royalty paid to including private antitrust action seeking treble damage under antitrust law the occurrence of any of the above could have material adverse effect on our business revenue result of operation cash flow and financial condition and our stock price could decline possibly significantly in which case we may have to cut cost and other us of cash including in research and development significantly impairing our ability to maintain product and technology leadership and invest in next generation technology further depending on the breadth and severity of the circumstance above we may have to reduce suspend or eliminate our capital return program and our ability to timely pay our indebtedness may be impacted these challenge have required and may in the future require the investment of significant management time and attention and have resulted and may in the future result in significant legal cost risk related to industry dynamic and competitionour revenue depend on our customer and licensee sale of product and service based on cdma ofdma and other communication technology including and customer demand for our product based on these technology we develop patent and commercialize technology and product based on cdma ofdma and other communication technology which are primarily wireless we depend on our customer and licensee to develop device and service based on these technology to drive consumer demand for new multimode and single mode device and to establish the selling price for such device further the timing of our shipment of our product is dependent on the timing of our customer and licensee deployment of new device and service based on these technology increasingly we also depend on operator of wireless network our customer and licensee and other third party to incorporate these technology into new device type and into industry and application beyond mobile handset such automotive and iot among others commercial deployment of network and device have begun and are expected to continue for the foreseeable future however the timing and scale of such deployment in certain region have been delayed due to the covid pandemic and may be further delayed for reason that are beyond our control our revenue and growth in revenue could be negatively impacted our business may be harmed and our substantial investment in these technology may not provide an adequate return if our customer and licensee revenue and sale of product particularly premium tier product and service using these technology and average selling price of such product decline due to for example the maturity of smartphone penetration in developed region including china we do not continue to maintain our intellectual property and technical leadership in including in ongoing standardization effort we are unable to drive the adoption of our product into network and device including device beyond mobile handset or consumer rate of replacement of smartphones and other device decline our industry is subject to intense competition in an environment of rapid technological change our success depends in part on our ability to adapt to such change and compete effectively and such change and competition could result in decreased demand for our product and technology or declining average selling price for our product or those of our customer or licensee our product and technology face significant competition competition may intensify our current competitor expand their product offering improve their product or reduce the price of their product part of strategy to maintain existing business and customer or attract new business and customer new opportunity develop and new competitor enter the industry competition in wireless communication is affected by various factor that include among others oem concentration vertical integration competition in certain geographic region government intervention or support of national industry or competitor the ability to maintain product differentiation in light of evolving industry standard and speed of technological change including the transition to smaller geometry process technology and the demand for always on always connected capability access to capacity in the supply chain and value added feature that drive selling price and consumer demand for new multimode and single mode device we anticipate that additional competitor will introduce product result of growth opportunity in wireless communication the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitor and technological and public policy change additionally the semiconductor industry ha experienced and may continue to experience consolidation which could result in significant change to the competitive landscape for example if any key supplier of technology and intellectual property to the semiconductor industry wa sold to one of our competitor it could negatively affect our ability to procure or license such technology and intellectual property in the future at all or upon acceptable term which could have wide ranging impact on our business and operation we expect that our future success will depend on among other factor our ability to differentiate our integrated circuit product with innovative technology across multiple product and feature modem rffe including millimeter wave mmwave graphic and other processor camera and connectivity and with smaller geometry process technology that drive both performance and lower power consumption develop and offer integrated circuit product at competitive cost and price point and to effectively cover all geographic region and all device tier continue to be leader in mobile and drive the adoption of our technology and integrated circuit product including rffe into the most popular device model and across broad spectrum of device in mobile such smartphones tablet laptop and other mobile computing device increase or accelerate adoption of our technology and product in industry and application outside of mobile handset including automotive and iot maintain or accelerate demand for our integrated circuit product at the premium device tier while also driving the adoption of our product into high mid and low tier device across all region remain leader in technology development standardization intellectual property creation and licensing and develop commercialize and remain leading supplier of integrated circuit product including rffe product maintain access to sufficient capacity in the supply chain relative to our competitor to meet customer demand create standalone value and contribute to the success of our existing business through acquisition joint venture and other strategic transaction and by developing customer licensee vendor distributor and other channel relationship in new industry and application identify potential acquisition target that will grow or sustain our business or address strategic need reach agreement on term acceptable to close the transaction and effectively integrate these new business product technology and employee provide leading product and technology to oems high level operating system hlos provider operator cloud provider and other industry participant competitor new industry entrant and other factor continue to affect the industry landscape be preferred partner and sustain preferred relationship providing integrated circuit product that support multiple operating system and infrastructure platform to industry participant that effectively commercialize new device using these platform and continue to develop brand recognition to effectively compete against better known company in computing and other consumer driven segment and to deepen our presence in significant emerging region and china we compete with many different semiconductor company ranging from multinational company with integrated research and development manufacturing sale and marketing organization across broad spectrum of product line to company that are focused on single application industry or standard product including those that produce product for mobile handset automotive or iot among others most of these competitor compete with with respect to some but not all of our business or product line company that design integrated circuit based on cdma ofdma wi fi or their derivative are generally competitor or potential competitor example some of which are strategic partner of ours in other area include apple broadcom mediatek nvidia nxp semiconductor qorvo samsung skyworks texas instrument and unisoc some of these current and potential competitor may have advantage over that include among others motivation by our customer in certain circumstance to use our competitor integrated circuit product to utilize their own internally developed integrated circuit product and or sell such product to others or to utilize alternative technology lower cost structure or willingness and ability to accept lower price or lower margin for their product particularly in china foreign government support of other technology competitor or oems that sell device that do not contain our integrated circuit product better known brand name ownership and control of manufacturing facility and greater expertise in manufacturing process the development and sale of infrastructure equipment for wireless network which may enable such competitor to better optimize their integrated circuit product for performance on those network more extensive relationship with local distribution company and oems in certain geographic region such china more experience in industry and application beyond mobile handset such automotive and iot and more established presence in certain region in addition certain of our largest integrated circuit customer have in the past utilized currently utilize and may in the future utilize our competitor integrated circuit product in some or all of their device rather than our product further certain of those customer have developed are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit product effectively making them competitor which they have in the past utilized currently utilize and may in the future utilize in some or all of their device rather than our product see also the risk factor titled our business particularly our semiconductor business may suffer result of our customer vertically integrating developing their own integrated circuit product further political action including trade and or national security protection policy or other action by government particularly the and chinese government have in the past currently are and could in the future limit or prevent from transacting business with certain of our customer or supplier limit prevent or discourage certain of our customer or supplier from transacting business with or make it more expensive to do so this could advantage our competitor by enabling them with increased sale economy of scale operating income and or cash flow and or enabling critical technology transfer allowing them to increase their investment in technology development research and development and commercialization of product see also the risk factor titled significant portion of our business is concentrated in china and the risk of such concentration are exacerbated by china trade and national security tension competition in any or all product tier may result in the loss of business or customer which would negatively impact our business revenue result of operation cash flow and financial condition such competition may also reduce average selling price for our chipset product or the product of our customer and licensee certain of these dynamic are particularly pronounced in emerging region and china where competitor may have lower cost structure or may have willingness and ability to accept lower price or lower margin on their product reduction in the average selling price of our chipset product without corresponding increase in volume would negatively impact our revenue and without decrease in average unit cost would negatively impact our margin in addition reduction in the average selling price of our licensee product unless offset by an increase in volume would generally decrease total royalty payable to negatively impacting our licensing revenue risk related to product defect or security vulnerabilitiesfailures in our product or in the product of our customer or licensee including those resulting from security vulnerability defect or error could harm our business our product are complex and may contain defect error or security vulnerability or experience failure or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issue including issue in material design fabrication packaging and or use within system development of product in new domain of technology and the migration to integrated circuit technology with smaller geometric feature size increase complexity and add risk to manufacturing yield and reliability and increase the likelihood of product defect error or security vulnerability defect error security vulnerability or other unintended functionality could also be introduced into our product by cyber attack or other action by malicious actor either directly or through third party product or software used in our product or it infrastructure including application further because of the complexity of our product defect error or security vulnerability might only be detected when the product are in use risk associated with product or technology defect error or security vulnerability are exacerbated by the fact that our customer typically integrate our product into consumer and other device the use of device containing our product to interact with untrusted system or otherwise access untrusted content creates risk of exposing the system hardware and software in those device to malicious attack further security vulnerability in our product or the technology we use could expose our customer or end user of our customer product to hacker or other unscrupulous third party who develop and deploy malware that could attack our product or our customer product or it infrastructure such attack could result in the disruption of our customer business or the misappropriation theft misuse disclosure loss or destruction of the technology or intellectual property or the proprietary confidential or personal information of our customer their employee or the end user of our customer device while we continue to focus on this issue and take measure to safeguard our product from cybersecurity threat device capability continue to evolve enabling more elaborate functionality and application and increasing the risk of security failure and technique used to perpetrate cybersecurity attack are increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving see also the risk factor titled our business and operation could suffer in the event of security breach of our it system or other misappropriation of our technology intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information our product may be responsible for critical function in our customer product and network failure of our product to perform to specification meet certain regulatory or industry standard including product safety and information security standard which may differ by region geography and industry and which are particularly stringent in the automotive industry or other product defect error or security vulnerability could lead to substantial damage to the product we sell to our customer the device into which our product are integrated and the end user of such device and potentially to our customer it infrastructure such defect error or security vulnerability could give rise to significant cost including cost related to developing solution recalling product repairing or replacing defective product writing down defective inventory or indemnification obligation under our agreement and could result in the loss of sale and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development effort in addition defect error or security vulnerability in our product could result in failure to achieve market acceptance loss of design win shifting of business to our competitor and litigation or regulatory action against and could harm our reputation our relationship with customer and partner and our ability to attract new customer well the perception of our brand other potential adverse impact of product defect error or security vulnerability include shipment delay write offs of property plant and equipment and intangible asset and loss on unfavorable purchase commitment in addition defect error or security vulnerability in the product of our customer or licensee could cause delay or decrease in demand for the product into which our product are integrated and thus for our product in addition the occurrence of defect error or security vulnerability may give rise to product liability claim particularly if such defect error or security vulnerability in our product or the technology we use or the product into which they are integrated result in personal injury or death and could result in significant cost expense and loss if product liability claim is brought against the cost of defending the claim could be significant and could divert the attention of our technical and management personnel and harm our business even if we are successful we may be named in product liability claim even if there is no evidence that our product caused the damage in question and even though we may have indemnity from our customer and such claim could result in significant cost and expense we may also be required to indemnify and or defend our customer from product liability claim relating to our product further our business liability insurance may be inadequate may not cover the claim and future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable term which could adversely impact our financial result the above is exacerbated by the fact that our product may be used and perform critical function in various high risk application such automobile including ada ad function camera and artificial intelligence including home and enterprise security home automation including smoke and noxious gas detector medical condition monitoring location and asset tracking and management including wearable for child safety and elderly health robotics including public safety drone and autonomous municipality vehicle and extended reality xr for treatment of phobia or ptsd early detection of disorder or special need among others defect error or security vulnerability in our product or the technology we use could have an adverse impact on on our customer and the end user of our customer product if any of these risk materialize there could be material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition risk related to intellectual propertythe enforcement and protection of our intellectual property may be expensive could fail to prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property could result in the loss of our ability to enforce one or more patent and could be adversely affected by change in patent law by law in certain foreign jurisdiction that may not effectively protect our intellectual property and by ineffective enforcement of law in such jurisdiction we rely primarily on patent copyright trademark and trade secret law well nondisclosure and confidentiality agreement international treaty and other method to protect our intellectual property including our patent portfolio policing unauthorized use of our product technology and intellectual property is difficult and time consuming the step we have taken have not always prevented and we can not be certain the step we take in the future will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our product technology or intellectual property particularly in foreign country where the law may not protect our right fully or readily law or where the enforcement of such law may be lacking or ineffective see also the risk factor titled our business and operation could suffer in the event of security breach of our it system or other misappropriation of our technology intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information some industry participant who have vested interest in devaluing patent in general or standard essential patent in particular have mounted attack on certain patent system increasing the likelihood of change to established patent law we can not predict with certainty the long term effect of any potential change in the united state there is continued discussion regarding potential patent law change and there is current and potential future litigation regarding patent the outcome of which could be detrimental to our licensing business further the law in certain foreign country in which our patent are or may be licensed or our product are or may be manufactured or sold including certain country in asia may not protect our intellectual property right to the same extent the law in the united state in addition we can not be certain that the law and policy of any country or the practice of any standard body foreign or domestic with respect to intellectual property enforcement or licensing or the adoption of standard will not be changed in the future in way that are detrimental to our licensing program or to the sale or use of our product or technology we have had and may in the future have difficulty in certain circumstance in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property and contract including collecting royalty for use of our patent portfolio due to among others refusal by certain licensee to report and pay all or portion of the royalty they owe to policy or political action of government including trade protection and national security policy challenge to our licensing practice under competition law adoption of mandatory licensing provision by foreign jurisdiction failure of foreign court to recognize and enforce judgment of contract breach and damage issued by court in the united state and challenge before competition agency to our licensing business or the pricing and integration of additional feature and functionality into our chipset product see also the risk factor titled effort by some original equipment manufacturer oems to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalty for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resource and may result in legal decision or action by government court regulator or agency standard development organization sdos or other industry organization that harm our business and our business may suffer result of adverse ruling in governmental investigation or proceeding or other legal proceeding we have engaged in litigation and arbitration in the past and may need to further litigate or arbitrate in the future to enforce our contract and intellectual property right protect our trade secret or determine the validity and scope of proprietary right of others result of any such litigation or arbitration we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patent portion of our license agreement could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable which may in turn result in other licensee either not complying with their existing license agreement or initiating litigation or arbitration license term including but not limited to royalty rate for the use of our intellectual property could be imposed that are le favorable to than existing term and we could incur substantial cost any action we take to enforce our contract or intellectual property right could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention which in turn could negatively impact our result of operation and cash flow further even positive resolution to our enforcement effort may take time to conclude which may reduce our revenue and cash resource available for other purpose such research and development in the period prior to conclusion additionally although our license agreement generally provide with the right to audit the book and record of licensee audit can be expensive time consuming incomplete and subject to dispute further certain licensee may not comply with the obligation to provide full access to their book and record to the extent we do not aggressively enforce our right under our license agreement licensee may not comply with their existing license agreement and to the extent we do not aggressively pursue unlicensed company to enter into license agreement with for their use of our intellectual property other unlicensed company may not enter into license agreement see also the risk factor titled effort by some original equipment manufacturer oems to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalty for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resource and may result in legal decision or action by government court regulator or agency standard development organization sdos or other industry organization that harm our business and our business and could suffer in the event of security breach of our it system or other misappropriation of our technology intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information claim by other company that we infringe their intellectual property could adversely affect our business from time to time company have asserted and may again assert patent copyright or other intellectual property claim against relating to our technology or product including those we have acquired from other company these claim have resulted and may again result in our involvement in litigation and we are currently involved in such litigation including those described in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency we may not prevail in such litigation given among other factor the complex technical issue and inherent uncertainty in intellectual property litigation if any of our product were found to infringe another company intellectual property we could be subject to an injunction or be required to redesign our product or to license such intellectual property or pay damage or other compensation to such other company any of which could be costly if we are unable to redesign our product license such intellectual property used in our product or otherwise distribute our product through licensed supplier we could be prohibited from making and selling our product similarly our supplier could be found to infringe another company intellectual property and such supplier could then be enjoined from providing product or service to in any potential dispute involving and another company patent or other intellectual property our chipset foundry semiconductor assembly and test provider and customer could also become the target of litigation we are contingently liable under certain product sale service license and other agreement to indemnify certain customer chipset foundry and semiconductor assembly and test service provider against certain type of liability and damage arising from qualifying claim of patent infringement by product sold by or by intellectual property provided by to our chipset foundry and semiconductor assembly and test service provider reimbursement under indemnification arrangement could have an adverse effect on our result of operation and cash flow furthermore any such litigation could severely disrupt the supply of our product and the business of our chipset customer and their customer which in turn could harm our relationship with them and could result in decline in our chipset sale or reduction in our licensee sale causing corresponding decline in our chipset or licensing revenue any claim regardless of their merit could be time consuming to address result in costly litigation divert the effort of our technical and management personnel and or cause product release or shipment delay any of which could have an adverse effect on our result of operation and cash flow we may continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front of administrative body such the united state international trade commission to defend against patent assertion against our product by company some of whom are attempting to gain competitive advantage or leverage in licensing negotiation we may not be successful in such proceeding and if we are not the range of possible outcome is very broad and may include for example monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money royalty payment injunction on the sale of certain of our integrated circuit product or on the sale of our customer device using such product or the issuance of order to cease certain conduct or modify our business practice further governmental body in particular country or region may assert and may be successful in imposing remedy with effect that extend beyond the border of that country or region in addition negative outcome in any such proceeding could severely disrupt the business of our customer and their wireless operator customer which in turn could harm our relationship with them and could result in decline in our chipset sale or reduction in our licensee sale causing corresponding decline in our chipset or licensing revenue our use of open source software may harm our business certain of our software and our supplier software may contain or may be derived from open source software and we have seen and believe that we will continue to see customer request that we develop product including software associated with our integrated circuit product that incorporate open source software element and operate in an open source environment which under certain open source license may offer accessibility to portion of our product source code and may expose our related intellectual property to adverse licensing condition licensing of such software may impose certain obligation on if we were to distribute derivative work of that software for example these obligation may require to make source code for the derivative work available to our customer in manner that allows them to make such source code available to their customer or license such derivative work under particular type of license that is different than what we customarily use to license our software furthermore in the course of product development we may make contribution to third party open source project that could subject our intellectual property to adverse licensing condition for example to encourage the growth of software ecosystem that is interoperable with our product we may need to contribute certain implementation under the open source licensing term that govern such project which may adversely impact our associated intellectual property developing open source product while adequately protecting the intellectual property upon which our licensing program depends may prove burdensome and time consuming under certain circumstance thereby placing at competitive disadvantage and we may not adequately protect our intellectual property also our use and our customer use of open source software may subject our product and our customer product to governmental and third party scrutiny and delay in product certification which could cause customer to view our product le desirable than our competitor product risk factorsthe covid pandemic or similar health crisis may impact our business or result of operation in the future the covid pandemic resulted in significant economic uncertainty significant decline in business and consumer confidence and global demand in the wireless industry among others and global economic slowdown which negatively affected our financial result over certain period specifically throughout most of calendar and into early calendar the decline in demand for smartphones and other consumer device sold by our customer or licensee resulted in decreased demand for our integrated circuit product and decrease in the royalty we earned on the licensing of our intellectual property similarly during calendar spike in covid case in certain part of china have led the chinese government to impose lockdown which have adversely affected consumer demand in the region and may continue to impact demand in the future the covid pandemic also caused to modify our workforce practice such having the vast majority of our employee work from home while we have generally reopened our office and are currently operating under hybrid work model we could be negatively affected in the future if among others significant number of our employee or employee who perform critical function become ill and or are quarantined the result of exposure to covid or similar health crisis or if government policy restrict the ability of those employee to perform their critical function see also the risk factor titled we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employee and our attempt to operate under hybrid work model may not be successful the covid pandemic or similar health crisis that may arise in the future could impact our business result of operation and financial condition in the manner described above and or through delayed reduced or cancelled customer order disruption or delay in our supply chain the inability of our customer or licensee to purchase or pay for our product or technology the insolvency of key supplier customer or licensee delay in reporting or payment from our customer or licensee or failure by other counterparties the degree to which the covid pandemic or similar health crisis may impact our future business result of operation and financial condition will depend on future development which are uncertain including but not limited to the duration of the pandemic or other health crisis spike in case in various geographic region the emergence spread and severity of new virus or disease variant the availability adoption and efficacy of vaccine or other medical treatment and government response and other action to limit the spread of the virus or disease or to mitigate resulting negative economic effect we are similarly unable to predict the extent to which covid or similar health crisis may impact our customer licensee supplier and other partner and their financial condition but adverse effect on these party could also adversely affect to the extent the covid pandemic or similar health crisis adversely affect our business result of operation or financial condition it may also have the effect of exacerbating the other risk discussed in this risk factor section we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturn we are also susceptible to decline in global regional and local economic condition generally our stock price and financial result are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuation due to these dynamic among others the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical volatile subject to downturn and characterized by constant and rapid technological change price erosion evolving technical standard frequent new product introduction short product life cycle and fluctuation in product supply and demand period of downturn have been characterized by diminished demand for end user product high inventory level excess or obsolete inventory adjustment or reserve underutilization of manufacturing

benefit related to the research and development tax credit income tax expense effective tax unrecognized tax benefit were billion and billion at september and september respectively the increase in unrecognized tax benefit in fiscal wa primarily due to expected refund of korean withholding tax previously paid licensee in korea continue to withhold tax on payment due under their licensing agreement at rate higher than we believe is owed which had an insignificant impact to our income tax provision if successful the refund will result in corresponding reduction in foreign tax credit we are subject to income tax in the and numerous foreign jurisdiction and are currently under examination by various tax authority worldwide primarily related to transfer pricing these examination are at various stage with respect to assessment claim deficiency and refund we continually ass the likelihood and amount of potential adjustment and adjust the income tax provision income tax payable and deferred tax in the period in which the fact giving rise to revision become known at september we believe our reserve are adequate based on fact known however the final determination of tax audit and any related legal proceeding could materially differ from amount reflected in our income tax provision and the related accrual beginning in fiscal for federal income tax purpose we are required to capitalize and amortize domestic research and development expenditure over five year and foreign research and development expenditure over fifteen year prior to such date such expenditure are deducted incurred if this requirement is not delayed or repealed our cash flow generated from operation will be adversely affected due to significantly higher cash tax payment however since the resulting deferred tax asset will be established at the statutory rate of rather than the effective rate of to after considering the fdii deduction capitalization will favorably affect our provision for income tax and result of operation the adverse cash flow impact and favorable tax provision impact will diminish in future year capitalized research and development expenditure amortize in august the inflation reduction act ira wa enacted in the united state which included among other item book minimum tax on adjusted financial statement earnings beginning in fiscal we do not expect this provision

gain on investment in fiscal which were primarily driven by the change in fair value of certain of our marketable equity investment in early or growth stage company and lower realized gain resulting from the sale of certain of our non marketable investment looking forwardin the coming year we expect consumer demand for multimode and product and service to continue to ramp around the world we continue to transition from multimode and product and service we believe that combined with high performance low power processing and on device intelligence will continue to drive adoption of certain technology that are already commonly used in smartphones by industry and application beyond mobile handset such automotive and iot we believe it is important that we remain leader in technology development standardization intellectual property creation and licensing and leading developer and supplier of integrated circuit product in order to sustain and grow our business long term we look forward to the next several quarter we expect continued weakness in the macroeconomic environment which will continue to negatively impact consumer demand for smartphones and other device that incorporate our product and technology and our customer to draw down on their inventory which is at elevated level given the rapid deceleration in consumer demand and the easing of supply constraint and which may take the next couple quarter to resolve and that both of these dynamic will have negative impact on our revenue result of operation and cash flow compared to the prior year while capacity constraint have largely abated we expect to continue to see price increase from certain of our key semiconductor wafer supplier we expect commercial network deployment and device launch will continue we expect continued intense competition particularly in china current china trade relation and or national security protection policy may negatively impact our business growth prospect and result of operation see risk factor in this annual report including the risk factor titled significant portion of our business is concentrated in china and the risk of such concentration are exacerbated by china trade and national security tension the degree to which the covid pandemic impact our business financial condition and result of operation will depend on future development which

in addition to the foregoing business and market based matter we continue to devote resource to working with and educating participant in the wireless industry and government to the benefit of our licensing program and our extensive technology investment in promoting highly competitive and innovative wireless industry however we expect that certain company may be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalty for the use of our technology and not welcome the success of our licensing program in enabling new highly cost effective competitor to their product accordingly such company and or government or regulator may continue to challenge our business model in various forum throughout the world further discussion of risk related to our business is provided in part item risk factor

marketable equity investment including those accounted for under the equity method wa included in other asset and wa billion and interest rate swap agreementsinterest rate risk substantially all of our debt is comprised of unsecured fixed rate note we are not subject to significant interest rate risk at september we had an aggregate principal amount of million in unsecured floating rate note due january the interest rate on our floating rate note are based on libor at september and september hypothetical increase in libor based interest rate of basis point would cause negligible increase to interest expense on an annualized basis it relates to our floating rate note at september we also had million in commercial paper outstanding for which our exposure to interest rate risk wa negligible based on the original maturity of approximately three month or le from time to time we manage our exposure to certain interest rate risk related to our long term debt through the use of interest rate swap during fiscal we entered into interest rate swap that are designated fair value hedge with an aggregate notional amount of billion to effectively convert certain fixed rate interest payment into floating rate payment on our outstanding debt we entered into these agreement in part to manage interest rate risk associated with our cash equivalent and marketable security in addition to change in the fair value of our outstanding debt at september hypothetical increase in interest rate of basis point would not cause loss an increase in interest expense related to these interest rate swap agreement would be offset by an increase in interest income from our cash equivalent and marketable security portfolio at september and september we had outstanding forward starting interest rate swap with an aggregate notional amount of billion and billion respectively to hedge the variability of forecasted interest payment on anticipated debt issuance the interest rate on our interest rate swap are based on libor at september and september hypothetical decrease in interest rate of basis point would cause negligible and million increase respectively to interest expense on an annualized basis resulting from the change in fair value of the interest rate swap related to our anticipated debt issuance foreign exchange risk we manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risk when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative and non derivative financial instrument including foreign currency forward and option contract with financial counterparties and net investment hedge we utilize such derivative financial instrument for hedging or risk management purpose rather than for speculative purpose counterparties to these derivative contract are all major banking institution in the event of the financial insolvency or distress of counterparty to our derivative financial instrument we may be unable to settle transaction if the counterparty doe not provide with sufficient collateral to secure it net settlement obligation to which could have negative impact on our result foreign currency option at september our net asset related to foreign currency option designated hedge of foreign currency risk on royalty earned from certain licensee wa million at september and september if our forecasted royalty revenue for currency in which we hedge were to decline by and foreign exchange rate were to change unfavorably by in our hedged foreign currency we would not incur loss our hedge position would continue to be fully effective foreign currency forward at september our net liability related to foreign currency forward contract designated hedge of foreign currency risk on certain operating expenditure transaction wa million if our forecasted operating expenditure for currency in which we hedge were to decline by and foreign exchange rate were to change unfavorably by in our hedged foreign currency we would incur negligible loss based on forecast at september assuming the same hypothetical market condition we would have incurred negligible loss at september our net liability related to foreign currency forward contract not designated hedging instrument used to manage foreign currency risk on certain receivables and payable wa negligible at september and september if the foreign exchange rate were to change unfavorably by in our hedged foreign currency we would not incur loss the change in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contract would be offset by the change in fair value of the related receivables and or payable being economically hedged net investment hedge in the third quarter of fiscal result of the reversal of the ec fine we discontinued the associated net investment hedge at september we have designated million of certain foreign currency denominated liability excluding accrued interest hedge of our net investment in foreign subsidiary at september and september if foreign exchange rate were to change unfavorably by in our hedged foreign currency there would be an increase of million and million respectively in the accumulated other comprehensive loss attributable to the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment related to our net investment hedge the change in value recorded in cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment would be expected to offset corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in the foreign subsidiary functional currency financial asset and liability held by consolidated subsidiary that are not denominated in the functional currency of those entity are subject to the effect of currency fluctuation and may affect reported earnings global company we face exposure to adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate we may hedge currency exposure associated with certain asset and liability denominated in nonfunctional currency and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transaction result we could experience unanticipated gain or loss on anticipated foreign currency cash flow well economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investment while we may hedge certain with non customer decline in currency value in certain region may if not reversed adversely affect future product sale because our product may become more expensive to purchase in the country of the affected currency our

for an asset or paid to transfer liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participant of the measurement date applicable accounting guidance provides an established hierarchy for input used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable input and minimizes the use of unobservable input by requiring that the most observable input be used when available observable input are input that market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from source independent of unobservable input are input that reflect our assumption about the factor that market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability there are three level of input that may be used to measure fair value level includes financial instrument for which quoted market price for identical instrument are available in active market level includes financial instrument for which there are input other than quoted price included within level that are observable for the instrument level includes financial instrument for which fair value is derived from valuation technique in which one or more significant input are unobservable including our own assumption asset and liability measured at fair value are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement we review the fair value hierarchy classification on quarterly basis change in the observability of valuation input may result in reclassification of level for certain security within the fair value hierarchy we recognize transfer into and out of level within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the fiscal month in which the actual event or change in circumstance that caused the transfer to occur cash equivalent and marketable security we obtain pricing information from quoted market price pricing vendor or quote from broker dealer we conduct review of our primary pricing vendor to determine whether the input used in the vendor pricing process are deemed to be observable contractual sale restriction are not considered in measuring the fair value of marketable equity security the fair value for interest bearing security includes accrued interest the fair value of treasury security and government related security corporate bond and note and common stock is generally determined using standard observable input including reported trade quoted market price matrix pricing benchmark yield broker dealer quote issuer spread two sided market and or benchmark security the fair value of mortgage and asset backed security is derived from the use of matrix pricing price for similar security or in some case cash flow pricing model with observable input such contractual term maturity credit rating and or securitization structure to determine the timing and amount of future cash flow derivative instrument derivative instrument that are traded on an exchange are valued using quoted market price and are included in level derivative instrument that are not traded on an exchange are valued using conventional calculation model that are primarily based on observable input such foreign currency exchange rate volatility and interest rate and therefore such derivative instrument are included in level other investment and other liability other investment and other liability included in level are comprised of our deferred compensation plan liability and related asset which consist of mutual fund and are included in other current asset and other asset gain and loss on the revaluation of our deferred compensation plan asset are recorded in investment and other income expense net corresponding offsetting amount related

issued in connection with certain merger and initial public offering of incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementsour non marketable equity investees and convertible debt instrument issued by private company the input we use to estimate the fair value of these instrument are generally unobservable and therefore they are included in level nonrecurring fair value measurement we measure certain asset and liability at fair value on nonrecurring basis these asset and liability include equity method and non marketable equity investment asset acquired and liability assumed in an acquisition or in nonmonetary exchange and property plant and equipment and intangible asset that are written down to fair value when they are held for sale or determined to be impaired all of which are generally measured based on unobservable input using an income or market approach inventory inventory are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value using the first in first out method recoverability of inventory is assessed based on review of future customer demand that considers multiple factor including committed purchase order from customer well purchase commitment projection provided by customer and our own forecast of customer demand among other factor this valuation also requires to make judgment and assumption based on information currently available about market condition including competition anticipated technological change internal product life cycle and development plan product pricing and other broader market condition that may impact customer demand such the impact of certain capacity constraint experienced across the semiconductor industry through the third quarter of fiscal and in fiscal well the impact of the macroeconomic environment in fiscal we generally place binding purchase order with our supplier in advance of receiving contractually binding forecast and or purchase order from our customer the time period between placing purchase order with our supplier and receiving contractually binding forecast and or purchase order from our customer ha increased and may continue to increase result of extended manufacturing lead time driven in part by continued transition to leading edge technology and or increased complexity in the manufacturing process of our product if we overestimate demand for our product the amount of our loss will be impacted by our contractual ability to reduce inventory purchase from our supplier our manufacturing relationship generally allow for cancellation of outstanding purchase commitment but in some case may require incremental fee and or the loss of amount paid in advance related to capacity underutilization further if our customer cancel purchase order or alter forecast this may result in excess inventory on hand our assumption of future product demand are inherently uncertain and change in our estimate and assumption may cause to record additional write down in the future if demand forecasted for specific product is greater than actual demand property plant and equipment property plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful life upon the retirement or disposition of property plant and equipment the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed and gain or loss is recorded when appropriate building on owned land are depreciated over year and building improvement are depreciated over year leasehold improvement and building on leased land are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful life not to exceed year and year respectively or the remaining term of the related lease other property plant and equipment have useful life ranging from to year maintenance repair and minor renewal or betterment are charged to expense incurred operating lease operating lease asset and liability are recognized for lease with lease term greater than month based on the present value of the future lease payment over the lease term at the commencement date operating lease are included in other asset other current liability and other liability on our consolidated balance sheet our lease term may include option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such option we account for substantially all lease and related non lease component together single lease component operating lease expense is recognized on straight line basis over the lease term goodwill and other intangible asset goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible asset of business acquired acquired intangible asset other than goodwill are amortized over their useful life unless the life are determined to be indefinite for intangible asset purchased in business combination the estimated fair value of the asset received are used to establish their recorded value for intangible asset acquired in nonmonetary exchange the estimated fair value of the asset transferred or the estimated fair value of the asset received if more clearly evident are used to establish their recorded value unless the value of neither the asset received nor the asset transferred are determinable within reasonable limit in which case the asset received are measured based on the carrying value of the asset transferred valuation technique consistent with the market approach income approach and or cost approach are used to measure fair value an estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumption that require significant judgment for example the income approach generally requires to use assumption to estimate future cash flow including those related to total addressable market pricing and share forecast competition technology obsolescence future tax rate and discount rate our estimate of the fair value of certain asset may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumption or utilize different business model and from the future cash flow actually realized impairment of goodwill other indefinite lived asset and long lived asset goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset are tested annually for impairment in the fourth fiscal quarter and in interim period if event or change in circumstance indicate that the asset may be impaired if qualitative assessment is used and we determine that the fair value of reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset is more likely than not likelihood of more than le than it carrying amount quantitative impairment test will be performed if goodwill is quantitatively assessed for impairment and reporting unit carrying value exceeds it fair value the difference is recorded an impairment other incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementsindefinite lived intangible asset are quantitatively assessed for impairment if necessary by comparing their estimated fair value to their carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the difference is recorded an impairment our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicator and future cash flow related to goodwill other indefinite lived asset and long lived asset may be based on operational performance of our business market condition expected selling price and or other factor although there are inherent uncertainty in this assessment process the estimate and assumption we use including estimate of future cash flow and discount rate are consistent with our internal planning when appropriate if these estimate or their related assumption change in the future we may be required to record an impairment charge on portion or all of such asset furthermore we can not predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering event nor the impact such event might have on our reported asset value long lived asset such property plant and equipment and intangible asset subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of asset to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds it estimated future cash flow an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group long lived asset to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or their estimated fair value le cost to sell and are not depreciated revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from sale of integrated circuit product and licensing of our intellectual property we also generate revenue from licensing system software and by performing development and other service and from other product sale the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon variety of factor including the specific term of each arrangement and the nature of our performance obligation revenue from sale of our product are recognized upon transfer of control to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment revenue from providing service are typically recognized over time our performance obligation is satisfied revenue from providing service and licensing system software were each le than of total revenue for all period presented we grant license or otherwise provide right to use portion of our intellectual property portfolio which among other right includes certain patent right essential to and or useful in the manufacture sale or use of certain wireless product licensee pay royalty based on their sale of product incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property and may also pay fixed license fee in one or more installment sale based royalty are generally based upon percentage of the wholesale licensee selling price of complete licensed product net of certain permissible deduction including transportation insurance packing cost and other item we broadly provide per unit royalty cap that apply to certain category of complete wireless device such smartphones tablet laptop and smartwatches and provide for maximum royalty amount payable per device we estimate and recognize sale based royalty on such licensed product in the period in which the associated sale occur considering all relevant information historical current and forecasted that is reasonably available to our estimate of sale based royalty are based largely on preliminary royalty estimate provided by our licensee and to lesser extent an assessment of the volume of device supplied into the market that incorporate or use our licensed intellectual property combined with an estimate of the mix of such sale on licensee by licensee basis well the licensee average wholesale price of such product in the period presented we have recognized immaterial difference between preliminary royalty estimate provided to by licensee and actual amount reported and paid by licensee which are generally received the following quarter licensee have not completed their royalty reporting process at the time estimate are provided to and in certain case they do not provide all necessary information in order for to calculate an estimate of royalty due which requires to independently estimate certain information we also consider in our estimate of sale based royalty any change in pricing we plan or expect to make and certain constraint on our ability to estimate such royalty result of recognizing revenue in the period in which the licensee sale occur using estimate adjustment to revenue are required in subsequent period to reflect change in estimate new information becomes available primarily resulting from actual amount reported by our licensee license agreement that require payment of license fee contain single performance obligation that represents ongoing access to portfolio of intellectual property over the license term since such agreement provide the licensee the right to access portfolio of intellectual property that exists at inception of the license agreement and to update and new intellectual property that is added to the licensed portfolio during the term of the agreement that are highly interdependent or interrelated since we expect to expend effort to develop and transfer update to our licensed portfolio on an even basis license fee are recognized revenue on straight line basis over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee we account for contract with customer licensee when it is legally enforceable the party are committed to perform their respective obligation the right of the party regarding the good and or service to be transferred are identified payment term are identified the contract ha commercial substance and collectability of substantially all of the consideration is probable which for product sale is generally when customer purchase order is executed and for licensing revenue is generally upon execution of license agreement if all such condition are not met revenue and any associated receivables incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementsare generally not recognized until such time that the required condition are met cash collected from customer prior to contract existing is recorded to other customer related liability in other current liability from time to time regulatory authority investigate our business practice particularly with respect to our licensing business and institute proceeding against depending on the matter various remedy that could result from an unfavorable resolution include among others the loss of our ability to enforce one or more of our patent injunction monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money the issuance of order to cease certain conduct or modify our business practice such requiring to reduce our royalty rate reduce the base on which our royalty are calculated grant patent license to chipset manufacturer sell chipsets to unlicensed original equipment manufacturer oems or modify or renegotiate some or all of our existing license agreement and determination that some or all of our license agreement are invalid or unenforceable additionally from time to time company initiate various strategy in an attempt to negotiate renegotiate reduce and or eliminate their need to pay royalty to for the use of our intellectual property which may include disputing underreporting underpaying not reporting and or not paying royalty owed to under their license agreement with or reporting to in manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligation in such case we estimate and recognize licensing revenue only when we have contract defined in the revenue recognition guidance which includes among other item evaluating whether our license agreement remain valid and enforceable and evaluating licensee conduct and whether they remain committed to perform their respective obligation we also estimate and recognize licensing revenue only to the extent it is probable that significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur which includes among other item determining the expected impact if any to revenue of any license agreement that may be renegotiated and or are newly entered into we analyze the risk of significant revenue reversal considering both the likelihood and magnitude of the reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of estimated revenue recognized in order to mitigate this risk which may result in recognizing revenue le than amount contractually owed to these aforementioned estimate may require significant judgment we measure revenue including our estimate of sale based royalty based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for product or service we record reduction to revenue for customer incentive arrangement including volume related and other pricing rebate and cost reimbursement for marketing and other activity involving certain of our product and technology in the period that the related revenue are earned for certain qct qualcomm cdma technology customer incentive arrangement there is complexity in applying certain contractual term to determine the amount recorded reduction to revenue for the period presented no significant reversal of revenue have been made related to such amount previously recorded the amount accrued for customer incentive arrangement are recorded reduction to account receivable net or other current liability based on whether we have the intent and contractual right of offset certain amount recorded reduction to revenue for customer incentive arrangement are considered variable consideration and are included in the transaction price primarily based on estimating the most likely amount expected to be provided to the customer licensee adjustment made to revenue in subsequent period to reflect change in estimate new information becomes available are included in our disclosure of revenue recognized from previously satisfied performance obligation note revenue recognized from sale of our product and sale based royalty are generally included in account receivable net including unbilled receivables based on our unconditional right to payment for satisfied or partially satisfied performance obligation concentration significant portion of our revenue are concentrated with small number of customer licensee of our qct and qtl qualcomm technology licensing segment the comparability of customer licensee concentration for the period presented are impacted by the timing of customer licensee device launch and or innovation cycle and other seasonal trend among other fluctuation in demand revenue from each customer licensee that were or greater of total revenue were follows september licensee customer licensee customer licensee customer licensee le than we rely on sole or limited source supplier for some product particularly product in our qct segment subjecting to possible shortage of raw material or manufacturing capacity the loss of supplier or the inability of supplier to meet performance or quality specification or delivery schedule could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligation and or negatively impact our revenue business operation and ability to compete for future business share based compensation share based compensation expense for equity classified award principally related to restricted stock unit rsus is measured at the grant date or at the acquisition date for award assumed in business combination based on the estimated fair value of the award and

consolidated financial statementsthe rsus are assumed share based compensation expense is adjusted to exclude amount related to share based award that are expected to be forfeited legal and regulatory proceeding we are currently involved in certain legal and regulatory proceeding litigation and investigation are inherently uncertain and we face difficulty in evaluating or estimating likely outcome or range of possible loss in antitrust and trade regulation investigation in particular investigation by antitrust and trade regulation agency are not conducted in consistent manner across jurisdiction further each country and agency ha different set of law rule and regulation both substantive and procedural well different legal principle theory and potential remedy and some agency may seek to use the investigation to advance domestic policy goal depending on the jurisdiction these investigation can involve non transparent procedure under which we may not receive access to evidence relied upon by the enforcement agency or that may be exculpatory and may not be informed of the specific legal theory or evidence considered or relied upon by the agency unlike in civil litigation in the united state in foreign proceeding we may not be entitled to discovery or deposition allowed to cross examine witness or confront our accuser result we may not be aware of and may not be entitled to know all allegation against or the information or document provided to or discovered or prepared by the agency accordingly we may have little or no idea what an agency intent is with respect to liability penalty or the timing of decision in many case the agency are given significant discretion and any available precedent may have limited if any predictive value in their jurisdiction or other jurisdiction accordingly we can not predict the outcome of these matter broad range of remedy with respect to our business practice that are deemed to violate applicable law are potentially available these remedy may include among others injunction monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money and the issuance of order to cease certain conduct and or to modify our business practice if there is at least reasonable possibility that material loss may have been incurred associated with pending legal and regulatory proceeding we disclose such fact and if reasonably estimable we provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of possible loss we record our best estimate of loss related to pending legal and regulatory proceeding when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated where range of loss can be reasonably estimated with no best estimate in the range we record the minimum estimated liability additional information becomes available we ass the

recognize deferred tax asset and liability for the expected future tax consequence of temporary difference between the carrying amount and the tax base of asset and liability tax law and rate change are reflected in income in the period such change are enacted we record valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized we include interest and penalty related to income tax including unrecognized tax benefit within income tax expense we classify all deferred tax asset and liability noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet we recognize excess tax benefit and shortfall tax detriment associated with share based award in the consolidated statement of operation component of income tax expense when realized our income tax return are based on calculation and assumption that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authority in addition the calculation of our tax liability involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulation we recognize liability for uncertain tax position based on two step process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement while we believe we have appropriate support for the position taken on our tax return we regularly ass the potential outcome of examination by tax authority in determining the adequacy of our provision for income tax we continually ass the likelihood and amount of potential adjustment and adjust the income tax provision income tax payable and deferred tax in the period in which the fact that give rise to revision become known we are subject to income tax in the united state and numerous foreign jurisdiction and the assessment of our income tax position involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax law and regulation in various taxing jurisdiction in addition the application of tax law and regulation is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax law and regulation themselves are subject to change result of change in fiscal policy change in legislation the evolution of regulation and court ruling significant judgment and estimate are required in determining our provision for income tax including those related to special deduction such fdii foreign derived intangible income tax incentive intercompany research and development cost sharing arrangement transfer

sustained the increase in unrecognized tax benefit for all period presented wa primarily due to expected refund of korean withholding tax previously paid which such increase had an insignificant
