been judicial congressional and executive challenge to certain aspect of the ppaca and there may be additional challenge and amendment to the ppaca in the future moreover there ha recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturer set price for their marketed product which ha resulted in several congressional inquiry and proposed and enacted legislation designed among other thing to bring more transparency to product pricing review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient program and reform government program reimbursement methodology for medical product individual state in the have also become increasingly active in implementing regulation designed to control product pricing including price or patient reimbursement constraint discount restriction on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measure and in some case mechanism to encourage importation from other country and bulk purchasing data privacy and security lawsas global organization we are subject to data privacy and security law regulation and customer imposed control in numerous jurisdiction result of access to and processing confidential personal and or sensitive data in the course of our business for example the european union general data protection regulation gdpr imposes significant restriction on we

and decreased market share even if we compete effectively we may be required to reduce the price we charge our business operate in industry that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation because of the range of the product and service we sell and the variety of market we serve we encounter wide variety of competitor refer to item business competition for additional detail in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationship with major customer and continue to grow our business by establishing relationship with new customer continually developing new product and service to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service category and penetrating new market including high growth market our ability to compete can also be impacted by changing customer preference and requirement for example increased demand for product incorporating digital capability or more environmentally friendly product and supplier practice well change in the way healthcare service are delivered including the movement of some care from acute to non acute setting and increased focus on chronic disease management cost containment effort by government and the private sector particularly in the healthcare industry are also resulting in increased emphasis on product that reduce cost and improve efficiency and effectiveness in addition significant shift in industry market share have occurred and may in the future occur in connection with product problem safety alert and publication about product reflecting the competitive significance of product quality product efficacy and quality system in our industry our failure to compete effectively and or pricing pressure resulting from competition may adversely impact our business and financial statement and our expansion into new market may result in greater than expected risk liability and expense in addition the company competitor and customer have from time to time introduced and may in the future introduce private label generic or low cost product that compete with the company product at lower price point new disruptive technology may emerge that displace the company existing technology competitor product can capture significant market share or lead to decrease in market price overall resulting in an

service based on technological innovation we generally sell our product and service in industry that are characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introduction and changing industry standard if we do not develop innovative new and enhanced product and service on timely basis our offering will become obsolete over time and our business and financial statement will suffer our success depends on several factor including our ability to correctly identify customer need and preference and predict future need and preference allocate our funding to product and service with higher growth prospect anticipate and respond to our competitor development of new product and service and technological innovation differentiate our offering from our competitor offering and avoid commoditization innovate and develop new technology and application and acquire or obtain right to third party technology that may have valuable application in our served market obtain adequate intellectual property right with respect to key technology before our competitor do successfully commercialize new technology in timely manner price them competitively and cost effectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volume of new product of appropriate quality on time obtain necessary regulatory approval of appropriate scope including with respect to medical device product by demonstrating satisfactory clinical result where applicable well achieving third party reimbursement and stimulate customer demand for and convince customer to adopt new technology we fail to accurately predict future customer need and preference or fail to produce viable technology we may invest heavily in of product and service that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our business and financial statement even when we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced product and service we often incur substantial cost in doing and our profitability may suffer in addition promising new offering may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concern failure to achieve positive clinical outcome uncertainty over third party reimbursement or entrenched pattern of clinical practice competitor may also develop after market service and part for our product which may detract from our sale the health care industry and related industry that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant change in an effort to reduce and increase the predictability of cost which can adversely affect our business and financial statement the health care industry and related industry that we serve have undergone and are in the process of undergoing significant change in an effort to reduce and increase the predictability of cost including the following many of our customer and the end user to whom our customer supply product rely on government funding of and reimbursement for healthcare product and service and research activity the ppaca health care austerity measure in other country and other potential healthcare reform change and government austerity measure have reduced and may further reduce the amount of government funding or reimbursement available to customer or end user of our product and service and or the volume of medical procedure using our product and service for example the protecting access to medicare act of pama introduced multi year pricing program for service payable under the clinical laboratory fee schedule clfs that is designed to bring medicare allowable amount in line with the amount paid by private payors it is still unclear whether and to extent these new rate will affect overall pricing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing service but to the extent our customer conclude that medicare reimbursement for these service is inadequate it can in turn adversely impact the price at which we sell our product other country well some private payors also control the price of health care product directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing or coverage limitation tying reimbursement to outcome or in the case of governmental entity through compulsory licensing or limiting of intellectual property protection global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adversely impact government funding and reimbursement governmental and private health care provider and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the delivery of healthcare service centralizing purchasing limiting the number of vendor that may participate in purchasing program forming group purchasing organization strategic alliance and integrated health delivery network and pursuing consolidation to improve their purchasing leverage using competitive bid process to procure healthcare product and service and investing in health care practice to increase their control over health care spending payors are also seeking to improve price predictability in an effort to mitigate exposure to future price increase these change well other impact from market demand government regulation third party coverage and reimbursement policy and societal pressure are changing the way healthcare is delivered reimbursed and funded and have in the past and could in the future cause participant in the healthcare industry and related industry that we serve to purchase fewer of our product and service reduce the price they are willing to pay for our product or service reduce the amount of reimbursement and funding available for our product and service from governmental agency or third party payors heighten clinical data requirement reduce the volume of medical procedure that

manufacturing for variety of reason including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocol and procedure problem with raw material or component cyber attack natural disaster and environmental factor and if not discovered before the product is released to market can result in recall and product liability exposure because of the time required to approve and license certain

component raw material other commodity and labor can result in production interruption delay extended lead time and inefficiency and adversely affect our business and financial statement in addition due to the highly competitive nature of the industry that we serve the cost containment effort of our customer and the term of certain contract we are party to when supply and labor price rise we are not always able to pas along cost increase through higher price for our product if we are unable to fully recover higher supply and labor cost through price increase or offset these increase through cost reduction or if there is time delay between the increase in cost and our ability to recover or offset these cost our margin and profitability can decline and our business and financial statement can be adversely affected our profitability could also be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchase to reflect change in customer demand and market fluctuation including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during market upturn supplier from time to time extend lead time limit supply or increase price conversely in order to secure supply for the production of product we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitment with vendor which can impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demand because we can not always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structure to changing market condition at time our manufacturing capacity exceeds or fall short of our production requirement any or all of these problem can result in the loss of customer or cost inefficiency provide an opportunity for competing product to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial statement adverse

particularly in the area of science and technology is extremely competitive and expectation from qualified talent in many area of the labor market have evolved and escalated recently in addition in we faced labor availability constraint and labor cost inflation in certain area of our business if we are le successful in our recruiting effort if we can not retain and motivate highly skilled worker and key leader representing diverse background experience and skill set or if we experience labor dispute our business and financial statement may be adversely affected our restructuring action can have long term adverse effect on our business and financial statement we have implemented significant restructuring activity across our business to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in

copyright trade secret and other intellectual property and license to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property right that we obtain however are not always sufficiently broad and do not always provide significant competitive advantage and patent may not be issued for pending or future patent application owned by or licensed to in addition the step that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property do not always prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented designed around or becoming subject to compulsory licensing in some circumstance enforcement is not available to because an infringer ha dominant intellectual property position or for other business reason we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreement with employee consultant and other party to protect in part trade secret and other proprietary right there can be no assurance that these agreement adequately protect our trade secret and other proprietary right and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedy for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially

property technology and or proprietary information such through compulsory licensing or ownership restriction or requirement in certain country we do not have the same ability to enforce intellectual property right we do in the governmental regulation relating to state secrecy or other topic limit our ability to transfer data or technology out of certain jurisdiction and risk cost and challenge of

licensing expense or be prevented from selling product or service from time to time we receive notice from third party alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation of third party intellectual property and can not be certain that the conduct of our business doe not and will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property right of others dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property can be costly and time consuming to defend due to the complexity of many of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting counterclaim or negotiating license in response to claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition result of such claim of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our right to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical product and service be required to pay substantial damage or license fee with respect to the infringed right be required to license technology or other intellectual property right from others be required to cease marketing manufacturing or using certain product or be required to redesign re engineer or re brand our product at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our business and financial statement third party intellectual property right may also make it more difficult or expensive for to meet market demand for particular product or design innovation when we are required to seek license under patent or other intellectual property right of others we are not always able to acquire these license on acceptable term if at all even if we successfully defend against claim of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant cost and diversion of management attention and resource which could adversely affect our business and financial statement the government ha certain right with respect to incremental production capacity attributable to and or the intellectual property we have developed using government financing in addition in time of national emergency the government could also control our allocation of manufacturing capacity certain agency of the

plan for potential impact on it business the company ha deployed our capability expertise and scale to address the critical health need related to covid including developing and making available diagnostic test for the rapid detection of covid well providing critical support to firm that are developing and producing vaccine and therapy for covid while the condition related to the pandemic generally improved in most geography in compared to condition vary significantly by geography for example during the first half of covid consideration resulted in the re imposition of widespread shutdown and restriction in china during the fourth quarter of china relaxed many of these restriction and began experiencing increasing covid related case resulting in lower patient volume for elective procedure and wellness visit hospital prioritized treating covid related case these higher covid related case in china are anticipated to continue at least into the first quarter of the resulting impact to the company will depend upon the prevalence of covid in the impacted region of china and the resulting impact on economic activity including demand and production capacity demand for the company product that support covid related vaccine and therapeutic including initiative that seek to prevent or mitigate similar future pandemic decreased in versus the company expects overall demand for these product to decrease in versus additionally demand for the company product that support covid testing continues to fluctuate significantly driven by increase or decrease in covid case in particular geography while sale of covid related testing product increased in compared to the company expects overall demand for these product to decrease in the pandemic subsides in most geography and evolves toward endemic status due to the speed with which the covid situation ha evolved the global breadth of it spread the range of governmental and community response thereto and our geographic

acquired business for total consideration of million in cash net of cash acquired the business acquired complement existing unit of each of the company four segment the aggregate annual sale of the business acquired in at the time of their acquisition in each case based on the company revenue for it last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition were approximately million refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for discussion regarding the company acquisition result of operationsin this report reference to the non gaap measure of core sale also referred to core revenue or sale revenue from existing business and core sale including cytiva refer to sale from continuing operation calculated according to generally accepted accounting principle in the united state gaap but excluding sale from acquired business defined below applicable and the impact of currency translation reference to sale or operating profit attributable to acquisition or acquired business refer to sale or operating profit applicable from acquired business recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition le any sale and operating profit during the applicable period attributable to divested product line not considered discontinued operation provided that in calculating core sale including cytiva cytiva sale net of the sale of the company product line divested in to obtain regulatory approval to acquire cytiva or the divested product line cytiva sale are excluded from the definition of sale attributable to acquisition or acquired business the portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated the difference between the period to period change in revenue excluding sale from acquired business defined above applicable and the period to period change in revenue excluding sale from acquired business defined above applicable after applying current period foreign exchange rate to the prior year period noted above beginning with result for the second quarter of the company also present core sale on basis that includes cytiva sale prior to the acquisition of cytiva danaher calculated core sale solely on basis that excluded sale from acquired business recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition however given cytiva significant size and historical core sale growth rate in each case compared to danaher existing business management belief it is appropriate to also present core sale on basis that includes cytiva sale management belief this presentation provides useful information to investor by demonstrating beginning immediately after the acquisition cytiva impact on the company growth profile rather than waiting to demonstrate such impact until month after the acquisition when cytiva would normally have been included in danaher core sale calculation danaher calculates period to period core sale growth including cytiva by adding cytiva sale to core sale for both the baseline and current period beginning in the second quarter of cytiva sale are included in core sale and therefore the measure core sale including cytiva is no longer provided for quarterly period beginning with the second quarter of core sale growth and the related measure of core sale including cytiva should be considered in addition to and not replacement for or superior to sale and may not be comparable to similarly titled measure reported by other company management belief that reporting these non gaap financial measure provides useful information to investor by helping identify underlying growth trend in danaher business and facilitating comparison of danaher revenue performance with it performance in prior and future period and to danaher peer management also us these non gaap financial measure to measure the company operating and financial performance and us core sale growth and previously used core sale growth including cytiva one of the performance measure in the company executive short term cash incentive program the company excludes the effect of currency translation from these measure because currency translation is not under management control is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trend and excludes the effect of acquisition other than cytiva sale in the case of core sale growth including cytiva and divestiture related item because the nature size timing and number of acquisition and divestiture can vary dramatically from period to period and between the company and it peer and can also obscure underlying business trend and make comparison of long term performance difficult of contentsthroughout this discussion reference to sale growth or decline refer to the impact of both price and unit sale and reference to productivity improvement generally refer to

judgment the company belief the following accounting estimate are most critical to an understanding of it financial statement estimate are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criterion the estimate requires assumption about material matter that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and material change in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to period for

company estimate the fair value of it reporting unit primarily using market based approach which relies on current trading multiple of forecasted ebitda for company operating in business similar to each of the company reporting unit to calculate an estimated fair value of each reporting unit in evaluating the estimate derived by the market based approach management make judgment about the relevance and reliability of the multiple by considering factor unique to it reporting unit including operating result business plan economic projection anticipated future cash flow and transaction and marketplace data well judgment about the comparability of the market proxy selected there are inherent uncertainty related to these assumption and management judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment result of the company change to it reportable segment in the fourth quarter of the company also changed it reporting unit of december the company had eight reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing reporting unit resulting from recent acquisition generally present the highest risk of impairment management belief the impairment risk associated with these reporting unit generally decrease these business are integrated into the company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth the company performed the annual goodwill impairment analysis on both the prior five reporting unit that existed before the change in reportable segment well the company eight reporting unit that resulted from the change in reportable segment the company annual goodwill impairment analysis and the analysis after the change in the company reporting unit in indicated that in all instance the fair value of the company reporting unit exceeded their carrying value and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company eight reporting unit of the testing date ranged from approximately to approximately in the test of the prior five reporting unit the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value for each of the previous reporting unit of the testing date also ranged from approximately to approximately to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculation used in both goodwill impairment test the company applied hypothetical decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical value to the reporting unit carrying value in both test based on this hypothetical decrease the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company reporting unit ranged from approximately to approximately the company review identified intangible asset for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred for finite lived intangible requires comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flow expected to be generated by the asset these analysis require management to make judgment and estimate about future revenue expense market condition and discount rate related to these asset indefinite lived intangible are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if event or change in circumstance indicate that potential impairment exists determining whether an impairment loss occurred for indefinite lived intangible asset involves calculating the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to their carrying value if the fair value is le than the carrying value the difference is recorded an impairment loss refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for description of intangible asset impairment charge recorded during if actual result are not consistent with management estimate and assumption goodwill and other intangible asset may be overstated and charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would

contract settlement expense that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessment require judgment concerning matter such litigation development and outcome the anticipated outcome of negotiation the number of future claim the cost of both pending and future claim and the value of the element in the outcome in addition because most contingency are resolved over long period of time liability may change in the future due to various factor including those discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement if the reserve established by the company with respect

and observable price change with same or similar security from the same issuer adjusted to reflect the specific right and preference of the security if applicable valuation of non marketable equity security are complex and require judgment due to the absence of market price lack of liquidity and the risk inherent in early stage company the uncertainty in the process of valuing security for which ready market doe not exist may cause our estimated value of these security to differ significantly from the value that would have been derived had ready market for the security existed and those difference could be material the company account for it investment in the partnership using the equity method accordingly the investment are initially recorded at cost and adjusted each period for the company share of the partnership income or loss and distribution received the partnership investment are recorded by the partnership on an estimated fair value basis and pose the same risk and require the same valuation judgment discussed above result change in the value of investment in the partnership will have direct impact on the company earnings impairment loss are recognized to reduce the
