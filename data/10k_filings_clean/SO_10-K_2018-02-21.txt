manner there may be delay in the project schedule that could result in increased cost the ultimate outcome of these matter can not be determined at this time see note to the financial statement of southern company under nuclear construction and of georgia power under retail regulatory matter nuclear construction for additional information regarding plant vogtle unit and southern company gas significant investment in pipeline and pipeline development project involve financial and execution risk southern company gas ha made significant investment in existing pipeline and pipeline development project many of the existing pipeline are and when completed many of the pipeline development project will be operated by third party if one of these agent fails to perform in proper manner the value of the investment could decline and southern company gas could lose part or all of the investment in addition from time to time southern company gas may be required to contribute additional capital to pipeline joint venture or guarantee the obligation of such joint venture with respect to certain pipeline development project southern company gas will rely on it joint venture partner for construction management and will not exercise direct control over the process all of the pipeline development project are dependent on contractor for the successful and timely completion of the project further the development of pipeline project involves numerous regulatory environmental construction safety political and legal uncertainty and may require the expenditure of significant amount of capital these project may not be completed on schedule at the budgeted cost or at all there may be cost overrun and construction difficulty that cause southern company gas capital expenditure to exceed it initial expectation moreover southern company gas revenue will not increase immediately upon the expenditure of fund on pipeline project pipeline construction occurs over an extended period of time and southern company gas will not receive material increase in revenue until the project is placed in service the occurrence of any of the foregoing event could adversely affect the result of operation cash flow and financial condition of southern company gas and southern company financial economic and market risksthe electric generation and energy marketing operation of the traditional electric operating company and southern power and the natural gas operation of southern company gas are subject to risk many of which are beyond their control including change in

fuel cost which could increase the cost of producing power decrease the amount received from the sale of energy and or make electric generating facility le competitive the market price for these commodity may fluctuate significantly over relatively short period of time among the factor that could influence energy price and fuel cost are prevailing market price for coal natural gas uranium fuel oil biomass and other fuel applicable used in the generation facility of the traditional electric operating company and southern power and in the case of natural gas distributed by southern company gas including associated transportation cost and supply of such commodity demand for energy and the extent of additional supply of energy available from current or new competitor liquidity in

estimate of future cash outlay associated with the asset retirement are discounted using credit adjusted risk free rate estimate of the timing and amount of future cash outlay are based on projection of when and how the asset will be retired and the cost of future removal activity the liability for aros primarily relates to the decommissioning of the company nuclear facility which include the

factor component of pension and other postretirement benefit expense include interest and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plan expected return on plan asset and amortization of certain unrecognized cost and obligation actual result that differ from the assumption utilized are accumulated and amortized over future period and therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future period while the company belief that the assumption used are appropriate difference in actual experience or significant change in assumption would affect it pension and other postretirement benefit cost and obligation key element in determining the company pension and other postretirement benefit expense are the expected long term return on plan asset and the discount rate used to measure the benefit plan obligation and the periodic benefit plan expense for future period the expected long term return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan asset is based on the company investment strategy historical experience and expectation for long term rate of return that consider external actuarial advice the company determines the long term return on plan asset by applying the long term rate of expected return on various asset class to the company target asset allocation for purpose of determining it liability

market observed yield for high quality fixed income security with maturity that correspond to expected benefit payment for and prior year the company computed the interest cost component of it net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense using the same single point discount rate beginning in the company adopted full yield curve approach for calculating the interest cost component whereby the discount rate for each year is applied to the liability for that specific year result the interest cost component of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense decreased by approximately million in basis point change in any significant assumption discount rate salary or long term return on plan asset would result in an million or le change in total

construction schedule current period loss combined with history of loss or projection of continuing loss significant decrease in market price and the inability to remarket generating capacity for an extended period if an indicator exists the asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the asset carrying value to the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flow directly attributable to the asset if the estimate of undiscounted future cash flow is le than the carrying value of the asset the fair value of the asset is determined and loss is recorded high degree of judgment is required

market participant at the measurement date exit price the company utilizes market data or assumption that market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability including assumption about risk and the risk inherent in the input to the valuation technique these input can be readily observable market corroborated or generally unobservable the company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurement to utilize the best available information accordingly the company us valuation technique that maximize the use of observable input and minimize the use of unobservable input fair value balance are classified based on the observance of those input the guidance establishes fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the input used to measure fair value the hierarchy give the highest priority to unadjusted quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level and the lowest priority to unobservable input level the three level of the fair value hierarchy defined by the guidance are follows level price in active market for identical asset or liability of the reporting date active market are those in which transaction for the asset or liability occur in
