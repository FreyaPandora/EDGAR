item item risk factor our operation and financial result are subject to various risk and uncertainty including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition result of operation cash flow and the trading price of our common stock we face intense competition across all market for our product and service which may lead to lower revenue or operating margin competition in the technology sector our competitor range in size from diversified global company with significant research and development resource to small specialized firm whose narrower product line may let them be more effective in deploying technical marketing and financial resource barrier to entry in many of our business are low and many of the area in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technology shifting user need and frequent introduction of new product and service our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative product device and service that appeal to business and consumer competition among platform ecosystem and device an important element of our business model ha been to create platform based ecosystem on which many participant can build diverse solution well established ecosystem creates beneficial network effect among user application developer and the platform provider that can accelerate growth establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margin we face significant competition from firm that provide competing platform application and service competing vertically integrated model in which single firm control the software and hardware element of product and related service ha succeeded with consumer product such personal computer tablet phone gaming console and wearable competitor pursuing this model also earn revenue from service integrated with the hardware and software platform we also offer some vertically integrated hardware and software product and service to the extent we shift portion of our business to vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margin we derive substantial revenue from license of window operating system on personal computer we face significant competition from competing platform developed for new device and form factor such smartphones and tablet computer these device compete on multiple base including price and the perceived utility of the device and it platform user are increasingly turning to these device to perform function that in the past were performed by personal computer even if many user view these device complementary to personal computer the prevalence of these device may make it more difficult to attract application developer to our pc operating system platform competing with operating system licensed at low or no cost may decrease our pc operating system margin in addition some of our device compete with product made by our oem partner which may affect their commitment to our platform competing platform have content and application marketplace with scale and significant installed base the variety and utility of content and application available on platform are important to device purchasing decision user sometimes incur cost to move data and buy new content and application when switching platform to compete we must successfully enlist developer to write application for our marketplace and ensure that these application have high quality customer appeal and value effort to compete with competitor content and application marketplace may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margin business model competition company compete with based on growing variety of business model even we transition more of our business to service and subscription business model the license based proprietary software model generates most of our software revenue we bear the cost of converting original idea into software product through investment in research and development offsetting these cost with the revenue received from licensing our product many of our competitor also develop and sell software to business and consumer under this model part item other competitor develop and offer free application online service and content and make money by selling third party advertising advertising revenue fund development of product and service these competitor provide to user at no or little cost competing directly with our revenue generating product some company compete with using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software at nominal cost to end user and earning revenue on advertising or complementary service and product these firm do not bear the full cost of research and development for the software some open source software vendor develop software that mimic the feature and functionality of our product the competitive pressure described may cause decreased sale volume price reduction and or increased operating cost such for research and development marketing and sale incentive this may lead to lower revenue gross margin and operating income our increasing focus on service present execution and competitive risk growing part of our business involves cloud based service available across the spectrum of computing device our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best in class platform and productivity service for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with ai at the time our competitor are rapidly developing and deploying cloud based service for consumer and business customer pricing and delivery model are evolving device and form factor influence how user access service in the cloud and sometimes the user choice of which suite of cloud based service to use we are devoting significant resource to develop and deploy our cloud based strategy the window ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment we are undertaking cultural and organizational change to drive accountability and eliminate obstacle to innovation the company investment in gaining insight from data is becoming central to the value of the service we deliver to customer to our operational efficiency and key opportunity in monetization customer perception of quality and operational efficiency our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory development that impede realizing the expected return from this investment besides software development cost we are incurring cost to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing service these cost will reduce the operating margin we have previously achieved whether we succeed in cloud based service depends on our execution in several area including continuing to bring to market compelling cloud based experience that generate increasing traffic and market share maintaining the utility compatibility and performance of our cloud based service on the growing array of computing device including pc smartphones tablet gaming console and other television related device continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platform to third party developer ensuring our cloud based service meet the reliability expectation of our customer and maintain the security of their data making our suite of cloud based service platform agnostic available on wide range of device and ecosystem including those of our competitor it is uncertain whether our strategy will attract the user or generate the revenue required to succeed if we are not effective in executing organizational and technical change to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new product and service we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investment described above this may negatively impact gross margin and operating income we make significant investment in new product and service that may not achieve expected return we will continue to make significant investment in research development and marketing for existing product service and technology including the window operating system the microsoft office system bing window server the window store the microsoft azure service platform office other cloud based offering and the xbox entertainment platform we also invest in the development and acquisition of variety of hardware for productivity communication and entertainment including pc tablet gaming device and hololens investment in new technology are speculative commercial success depends on many factor including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing if customer do not perceive our latest offering providing significant new functionality or other value they may reduce their purchase of new software and hardware product or upgrade unfavorably affecting revenue we may not achieve significant revenue from new product service and part item distribution channel investment for several year if at all new product and service may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margin for some new product and business will not be high the margin we have experienced historically we extensive preparation and ongoing compatibility testing for application and device to help ensure positive experience for our user installing window however negative upgrade experience could adversely affect the reception of window in the marketplace and could lead to litigation or regulatory action by customer and government agency in addition we anticipate that window will enable new post license monetization opportunity beyond initial license revenue our inability to realize these opportunity to the extent we expect could have an adverse impact on our revenue finally our practice for data collection use and management in window are subject to regulatory review and may result in decision directing to change these practice and imposing fine if so we could face negative public reaction degraded user experience and reduced flexibility in product design developing new technology is complex it can require long development and testing period significant delay in new release or significant problem in creating new product or service could adversely affect our revenue acquisition joint venture and strategic alliance may have an adverse effect on our business we expect to continue making acquisition and entering into joint venture and strategic alliance part of our long term business strategy in december we completed our acquisition of linkedin for billion the linkedin acquisition and other transaction and arrangement involve significant challenge and risk including that they do not advance our business strategy that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employee business system and technology or that they distract management from our other business if an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstance and interest of party it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement the success of these transaction and arrangement will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing product and service or develop compelling new one it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefit from these transaction and arrangement such increased revenue enhanced efficiency or increased market share or the benefit may ultimately be smaller than we expected these event could adversely affect our operating result or financial condition if our goodwill or amortizable intangible asset become impaired we may be required to record significant charge to earnings we acquire other company and intangible asset and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisition which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangible we review our amortizable intangible asset for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment at least annually factor that may be change in circumstance indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible asset may not be recoverable include decline in our stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimate and slower growth rate in industry segment in which we participate we may be required to record significant charge on our consolidated financial statement during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible asset is determined negatively affecting our result of operation for example in the fourth quarter of fiscal year we recorded billion charge for the impairment of goodwill and billion charge for the impairment of intangible asset and in the fourth quarter of fiscal year we recorded million charge for the impairment of intangible asset the impairment charge for both period related to our phone business our acquisition of linkedin resulted in significant increase in our goodwill and intangible asset balance we may not earn the revenue we expect from our intellectual property right we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property right protecting our intellectual property right and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on global basis is difficult while piracy adversely affect revenue the impact on revenue from outside the is more significant particularly in country where law are le protective of intellectual property right our revenue in these market may grow slower than the underlying device market similarly the absence of harmonized patent law make it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent right throughout the world we educate user about the benefit of licensing genuine product and obtaining indemnification benefit for intellectual property risk and we educate lawmaker about the advantage of business climate where intellectual property right are protected reduction in the legal protection for software intellectual property right could adversely affect revenue part item we may not receive expected royalty from our patent license we expend significant resource to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenue by incorporating that intellectual property in our product or service or in some instance by licensing our patent to others in return for royalty change in the law may weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patent these include legislative change and regulatory action that make it more difficult to obtain injunction and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patent similarly licensee of our patent may fail to satisfy their obligation to pay royalty or may contest the scope and extent of their obligation finally the royalty we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology selling price change in product using licensed patent or the difficulty of discovering infringement third party may claim we infringe their intellectual property right from time to time others claim we infringe their intellectual property right the number of these claim may grow because of constant technological change in the market in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technology the rapid rate of issuance of new patent and our offering of first party device such surface and lumia phone to resolve these claim we may enter into royalty and licensing agreement on term that are le favorable than currently available stop selling or redesign affected product or service or pay damage to satisfy indemnification commitment with our customer these outcome may cause operating margin to decline besides money damage in some jurisdiction plaintiff can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing marketing and selling our product or service that have infringing technology in some country such germany an injunction can be issued before the party have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patent we have paid significant amount to settle claim related to the use of technology and intellectual property right and to procure intellectual property right part of our strategy to manage this risk and may continue to do so we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code source code the detailed program command for our operating system and other software program is critical to our business although we license portion of our application and operating system source code to several licensee we take significant measure to protect the secrecy of large portion of our source code if significant portion of our source code leak we might lose future trade secret protection for that source code it may become easier for third party to compete with our product by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margin unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risk described in the next paragraph cyber attack and security vulnerability could lead to reduced revenue increased cost liability claim or harm to our competitive position security of microsoft information technology threat to it security can take variety of form individual and group of hacker and sophisticated organization including state sponsored organization or nation state continuously undertake attack that pose threat to our customer and our it these actor may use wide variety of method which may include developing and deploying malicious software to attack our product and service and gain access to our network and datacenters using social engineering technique to induce our employee user partner or customer to disclose password or other sensitive information or take other action to gain access to our data or our user or customer data or acting in coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attack cyber threat are constantly evolving increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them cyber threat can have cascading impact that unfold with increasing speed across our internal network and system and those of our partner and customer breach of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal system and business application impair our ability to provide service to our customer and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delay compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other asset require to allocate more resource to improved technology or otherwise adversely affect our business in addition our internal it environment continues to evolve often we are early adopter of new device and technology we embrace new way of sharing data and communicating internally and with partner and customer using method such social networking and other consumer oriented technology our business policy and internal security control may not keep pace with these change new threat emerge part item security of our product service device and customer data the security of our product and service is important in our customer decision to purchase or use our product or service security threat are challenge to company like whose business is technology product and service threat to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customer customer using our cloud based service rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our service and the protection of their data hacker tend to focus their effort on the most popular operating system program and service including many of and we expect that to continue hacker that acquire user account information at other company can use that information to compromise our user account where account share the same attribute like password to defend against security threat both to our internal it system and those of our customer we must continuously engineer more secure product and service enhance security and reliability feature improve the deployment of software update to address security vulnerability develop mitigation technology that help to secure customer from attack even when software update are not deployed maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network product and service and provide customer security tool such firewall and anti virus software the cost of these step could reduce our operating margin if we fail to do these thing well actual or perceived security vulnerability in our product and service could harm our reputation and lead customer to reduce or delay future purchase of product or subscription to service or to use competing product or service customer may also spend more on protecting their existing computer system from attack which could delay adoption of additional product or service customer may fail to update their system continue to run software or operating system we no longer support or may fail timely to install security patch any of these action by customer could adversely affect our revenue actual or perceived vulnerability may lead to claim against although our license agreement typically contain provision that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability there is no assurance these provision will withstand legal challenge legislative or regulatory action in these area may increase the cost to develop implement or secure our product and service disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud based offering we store and process increasingly large amount of personally identifiable information of our customer the continued occurrence of high profile data breach provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security despite our effort to improve the security control across our business group and geography it is possible our security control over personal data our training of employee and vendor on data security and other practice we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer data we or our vendor store and manage improper disclosure could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to customer or subject to liability under law that protect personal data resulting in increased cost or loss of revenue our software product and service also enable our customer to store and process personal data on premise or increasingly in cloud based environment we host government authority can sometimes require to produce customer data in response to valid legal order in the and elsewhere we advocate for transparency concerning these request and appropriate limitation on government authority to compel disclosure despite our effort to protect customer data perception that the collection use and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sale of our product or service and could limit adoption of our cloud based solution by consumer business and government entity additional security measure we may take to address customer concern or constraint on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer expectation or governmental rule or action may cause higher operating expense we may have outage data loss and disruption of our online service if we fail to maintain an adequate operation infrastructure our increasing user traffic growth in service and the complexity of our product and service demand more computing power we spend substantial amount to build purchase or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our website and in our datacenters these demand continue to increase we introduce new product and service and support the growth of existing service such bing exchange online microsoft azure microsoft account service office onedrive sharepoint online skype xbox live outlook com and window store we are rapidly growing our business of providing platform and back end hosting for service provided by third party to their end user maintaining securing and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex it requires that we maintain an internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraint that continue to evolve inefficiency or operational failure including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or insufficient internet connectivity could diminish the quality of our product service and user experience resulting in contractual liability claim by customer and other third party regulatory action damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential user subscriber and advertiser each of which may harm our operating result and financial condition part item government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rule may limit how we design and market our product leading global software and device maker government agency closely scrutinize under and foreign competition law an increasing number of government are regulating competition law activity and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large market such the european union eu the and china some jurisdiction also allow competitor or consumer to assert claim of anti competitive conduct federal and state antitrust authority have previously brought enforcement action and continue to scrutinize our business the european commission the commission closely scrutinizes the design of high volume microsoft product and the term on which we make certain technology used in these product such file format programming interface and protocol available to other company flagship product release such window can receive significant scrutiny under competition law for example in the commission ordered to create new version of our window operating system that do not include certain multimedia technology and to provide our competitor with specification for how to implement certain proprietary window communication protocol in their own product in the commission accepted set of commitment offered by microsoft to address the commission concern relating to competition in web browsing software including an undertaking to address commission concern relating to interoperability the web browsing commitment expired in the remaining obligation may limit our ability to innovate in window or other product in the future diminish the developer appeal of the window platform and increase our product development cost the availability of license related to protocol and file format may enable competitor to develop software product that better mimic the functionality of our product which could hamper sale of our product our portfolio of first party device continues to grow at the same time our oem partner offer large variety of device on our platform result increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partner creating risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rule regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase certain foreign government particularly in china and other country in asia have advanced argument under their competition law that exert downward pressure on royalty for our intellectual property because these jurisdiction only recently implemented competition law their enforcement activity are unpredictable government regulatory action and court decision such these may hinder our ability to provide the benefit of our software to consumer and business reducing the attractiveness of our product and the revenue that come from them new competition law action could be initiated the outcome of such action or step taken to avoid them could adversely affect in variety of way including we may have to choose between withdrawing product from certain geography to avoid fine or designing and developing alternative version of those product to comply with government ruling which may entail delay in product release and removing functionality that customer want or on which developer rely we may be required to make available license to our proprietary technology on term that do not reflect their fair market value or do not protect our associated intellectual property the ruling described above may be precedent in other competition law proceeding we are subject to variety of ongoing commitment because of court or administrative order consent decree or other voluntary action we have taken if we fail to comply with these commitment we may incur litigation cost and be subject to substantial fine or other remedial action our ability to realize anticipated window post sale monetization opportunity may be limited our global operation subject to potential liability under anti corruption trade protection and other law and regulation the foreign corrupt practice act and other anti corruption law and regulation anti corruption law prohibit corrupt payment by our employee vendor or agent from time to time we receive inquiry from authority in the and elsewhere and report from employee and others about our business activity outside the and our compliance with anti corruption law specifically we have been cooperating with authority in the in connection with report concerning our compliance with the foreign corrupt practice act in various country while we devote substantial resource to our global compliance program and have implemented policy training and internal control designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payment our employee vendor or agent may violate our policy our failure to comply with anti corruption law could result in significant fine and penalty criminal sanction against our officer or our employee prohibition on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation operation outside the may be affected by change in trade protection law policy and measure sanction and other regulatory requirement affecting trade and investment we may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell good or service in violation of trade sanction on country such iran north korea cuba sudan and syria part item other regulatory area that may apply to our product and online service offering include user privacy telecommunication data storage and protection and online content for example regulator may take the position that our offering such skype are covered by law regulating telecommunication service data protection authority may assert that our collection use and management of customer data is inconsistent with their law and regulation applying these law and regulation to our business is often unclear subject to change over time and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction additionally these law and government approach to their enforcement and our product and service are continuing to evolve compliance with these type of regulation may involve significant cost or require change in product or business practice that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalty or order we stop the alleged noncompliant activity law and regulation relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our service or result in increased cost legal claim or fine against the growth of our internet and cloud based service internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundary legal requirement relating to the collection storage handling and transfer of personal data continue to evolve for example the eu and the formally entered into new framework in july that provides mechanism for company to transfer data from eu member state to the this new framework called the privacy shield is intended to address shortcoming identified by the european court of justice in predecessor mechanism the privacy shield and other mechanism are subject to review by the european court which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfer across the atlantic in the eu adopted new law governing data practice and privacy called the general data protection regulation gdpr which becomes effective in may the law requires firm to meet new requirement regarding the handling of personal data engineering effort to build new capability to facilitate compliance with the law may entail substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resource from other project if we are unable to engineer product that meet microsoft legal duty or help our customer meet their obligation under the gdpr or other data regulation we might experience reduced demand for our offering non compliance with the gdpr may result in monetary penalty of up to of worldwide revenue ongoing legal review by regulator may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirement affecting the location and movement of our customer and internal employee data well the management of that data compliance may require change in service business practice or internal system that result in increased cost lower revenue reduced efficiency or greater difficulty in competing with foreign based firm failure to comply with existing or new rule may result in significant penalty or order to stop the alleged noncompliant activity our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employee our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employee the market for highly skilled worker and leader in our industry is extremely competitive we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration law change to immigration policy that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development effort if we are le successful in our recruiting effort or if we can not retain key employee our ability to develop and deliver successful product and service may be adversely affected effective succession planning is also important to our long term success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transition involving key employee could hinder our strategic planning and execution how employment related law are interpreted and applied to our workforce practice may result in increased operating cost and le flexibility in how we meet our workforce need we have claim and lawsuit against that may result in adverse outcome we are subject to variety of claim and lawsuit these claim may arise from wide variety of business practice and initiative including major new product release such window significant business transaction warranty or product claim and employment practice adverse outcome in some or all of these claim may result in significant monetary damage or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business the litigation and other claim are subject to inherent uncertainty and management view of these matter may change in the future material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statement could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable we may have additional tax liability we are subject to income tax in the and many foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax in the ordinary course of our business there are many transaction and calculation where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we regularly are under audit by tax authority in different jurisdiction economic and political pressure to increase tax revenue in various jurisdiction may make resolving tax dispute favorably more difficult although we believe our tax estimate are reasonable the final determination of tax audit and any related litigation in the jurisdiction where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provision and accrual the result of an audit or litigation could have material effect on our consolidated financial statement in the period or period in which that determination is made part item we earn significant amount of our operating income from outside the and any repatriation of fund currently held in foreign jurisdiction to the may result in higher effective tax rate for the company in addition there have been proposal from congress to change tax law that would significantly impact how multinational corporation are taxed on foreign earnings although we can not predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pas if enacted it could have material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow our hardware and software product may experience quality or supply problem our vertically integrated hardware product such xbox console surface device and other device we design manufacture and market are highly complex and can have defect in design manufacture or associated software we could incur significant expense lost revenue and reputational harm result of recall safety alert or product liability claim if we fail to prevent detect or address such issue through design testing or warranty repair we acquire some device component from sole supplier our competitor use some of the same supplier and their demand for hardware component can affect the capacity available to if component from sole source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable whether because of supplier capacity constraint or industry shortage we may not obtain timely replacement supply resulting in reduced sale component shortage excess or obsolete inventory or price reduction resulting in inventory adjustment may increase our cost of revenue xbox console surface device and other hardware are assembled in asia and other geography that may be subject to disruption in the supply chain resulting in shortage that would affect our revenue and operating margin these same risk would apply to any other vertically integrated hardware and software product we may offer our software product also may experience quality or reliability problem the highly sophisticated software product we develop may contain bug and other defect that interfere with their intended operation any defect we do not detect and fix in pre release testing could cause reduced sale and revenue damage to our reputation repair or remediation cost delay in the release of new product or version or legal liability although our license agreement typically contain provision that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability there is no assurance these provision will withstand legal challenge we strive to empower all people and organization to achieve more and accessibility of our product is an important aspect of this goal there is increasing pressure from advocacy group regulator competitor and customer to make technology more accessible if our product do not meet customer expectation or emerging global accessibility requirement we could lose sale opportunity or face regulatory action our global business expose to operational and economic risk our customer are located in over country and significant part of our revenue come from international sale the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risk emerging market are significant focus of our international growth strategy the developing nature of these market present several risk including deterioration of social political labor or economic condition in country or region and difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operation although we hedge portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rate between the dollar and foreign currency may adversely affect our revenue competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sale price of our software in the and other country catastrophic event or geopolitical condition may disrupt our business disruption or failure of our system or operation because of major earthquake weather event cyber attack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delay in completing sale providing service or performing other critical function our corporate headquarters significant portion of our research and development activity and certain other essential business operation are in the seattle washington area and we have other business operation in the silicon valley area of california both of which are seismically active region catastrophic event that result in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it system could harm our ability to conduct normal business operation providing our customer with more service and solution in the cloud put premium on the resilience of our system and strength of our business continuity management plan and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outage on our operating result part item abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose risk of general economic disruption in affected country which may increase our operating cost these condition also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decision by our customer and may cause supply chain disruption for hardware manufacturer geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory requirement that could impact our operating strategy access to global market hiring and profitability geopolitical instability may lead to sanction and impact our ability to do business in some market or with some public sector customer emerging nationalist trend in specific country may significantly alter the trade environment change to trade policy or agreement may result in higher tariff local sourcing initiative or other development that make it more difficult to sell our product in foreign country any of these change may negatively impact our revenue the long term effect of climate change on the global economy or the it industry in particular are unclear environmental regulation or change in the supply demand or available source of energy or other natural resource may affect the availability or cost of good and service including natural resource necessary to run our business change in weather where we operate may increase the cost of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud based service adverse economic or market condition may harm our business worsening economic condition including inflation recession or other change in economic condition may cause lower

model with unobservable input asset and liability measured at fair value on recurring basis using unobservable input are an immaterial portion of our portfolio majority of our investment are priced by pricing vendor and are generally level or level investment these vendor either provide quoted market price in an active market or use observable input for their pricing without applying significant adjustment broker pricing is used mainly when quoted price is not available the investment is not priced by our pricing vendor or when broker price is more reflective of fair value in the market in which the investment trade our broker priced investment are generally classified level investment because the broker price these investment based on similar asset without applying significant adjustment in addition all our broker priced investment have sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair value used are appropriate for these investment our fair value process include control that are designed to ensure appropriate fair value are recorded these control include model validation review of key model input analysis of period over period fluctuation and

include various combination of software service and hardware where element are delivered over different period of time and when allowed under gaap revenue is allocated to the respective element based on their relative selling price at the inception of the arrangement and revenue is recognized each element is delivered we use hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to element vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe ii third party evidence and iii best estimate of selling price esp for software element we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of vsoe in establishing fair value generally vsoe is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace esp are established best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable were sold regularly on stand alone basis our process for determining esp requires judgment and considers multiple factor that may vary over time depending upon the unique fact and circumstance related to each deliverable customer purchasing window license will receive unspecified update and upgrade over the life of their window device at no additional cost these update and upgrade will not be sold on stand alone basis we are unable to establish vsoe accordingly revenue from license of window is recognized ratably over the estimated life of the related device which range between two to four year the new standard related to revenue recognition will have material impact on our consolidated financial statement see note accounting policy in the note to financial statement part ii item of this form for further discussion impairment of investment security we review investment quarterly for indicator of other than temporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment in making this judgment we employ systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investment if the cost of an

for equity security our intent and ability to hold or plan to sell the investment for fixed income security we also evaluate whether we have plan to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery we also consider specific adverse condition related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance change in technology and operational and financing cash flow factor decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense net and new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry and or investee condition deteriorate we may incur future impairment goodwill we allocate goodwill to reporting unit based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination we evaluate our reporting unit on an annual basis and if necessary reassign goodwill using relative fair value allocation approach goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis may for and between annual test if an event occurs or circumstance change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting unit below it carrying value these event or circumstance could include significant change in the business climate legal factor operating performance indicator competition or sale or disposition of significant portion of reporting unit application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting unit assignment of asset and liability to reporting unit assignment of goodwill to reporting unit and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of discounted cash flow methodology this analysis requires significant judgment including estimation of future cash flow which is dependent on internal forecast estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flow will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital part ii item the estimate used to calculate the fair value of reporting unit change from year to year based on operating result market condition and other factor change in these estimate and assumption could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit research and development cost cost incurred internally in researching and developing computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility ha been established for the product once technological feasibility is established all software cost are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customer judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of product is established we have determined that technological feasibility for our software product is reached after all high risk development issue have been resolved through coding and testing generally this occurs shortly before the product are released to production the amortization of these cost is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the product legal and other contingency the outcome of legal proceeding and claim brought against are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from loss contingency such legal proceeding or claim is accrued by charge to income if it is probable that an asset ha been impaired or liability ha been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in determining whether loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factor the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make reasonable estimate of the amount of loss change in these factor could materially impact our consolidated financial statement income tax the objective of accounting for income tax are to recognize the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liability and asset for the future tax consequence of event

exist whether element can be accounted for separate unit of accounting and if so the fair value for each of the element microsoft enters into arrangement that can include various combination of software service and hardware where element are delivered over different period of time and when allowed under gaap revenue is allocated to the respective element based on their relative selling price at the inception of the arrangement and revenue is recognized each element is delivered we use hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to element vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe ii third party evidence and iii best estimate of selling price esp for software element we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of vsoe in establishing fair value generally vsoe is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace esp are established best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable were sold regularly on stand alone basis our process for determining esp requires judgment and considers multiple factor that may vary over time depending upon the unique fact and circumstance related to each deliverable revenue

license existing version of the product during the eligibility period revenue is allocated between the existing product and the new product and revenue allocated to the new product is deferred until that version is delivered the revenue allocation is based on the vsoe of fair value of the product the vsoe of fair value for upcoming new product are based on the price determined by management having the relevant authority when the element is not yet sold separately but is expected to be sold in the near future at the price set by management software update that will be provided free of charge are evaluated on case by case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade and create multiple element arrangement which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered or if it is determined that implied post contract customer support pc is being provided the arrangement is accounted for multiple element arrangement and all revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied pc term when the vsoe of fair value doe not exist if update are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade revenue is generally recognized product are shipped or made available customer purchasing window license will receive unspecified update and upgrade over the life of their window device at no additional cost these update and upgrade will not be sold on stand alone basis we are unable to establish vsoe of fair value accordingly revenue from license of window is recognized ratably over the estimated life of the related device which range between two to four year certain volume licensing arrangement include perpetual license for current product combined with right to receive unspecified future version of software product which we have determined are additional software product and are therefore accounted for subscription with billing recorded unearned revenue and recognized revenue ratably over the coverage period arrangement that include term based license for current product with the right to use unspecified future version of the software during the coverage period are also accounted for subscription with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period revenue from cloud based service arrangement that allow for the use of hosted software product or service over contractually determined period of time without taking possession of software are accounted for subscription with billing recorded unearned revenue and recognized revenue ratably over the coverage period beginning on the date the

commensurate with the customer utilization of such resource some volume licensing arrangement include time based subscription for cloud based service and software offering that are accounted for subscription these arrangement are considered multiple element arrangement however because all element are accounted for subscription and have the same coverage period and delivery pattern they have

with the delivery of consulting service and the amortization of capitalized software development cost capitalized software development cost are amortized over the estimated life of the product product warranty we provide for the estimated cost of fulfilling our obligation under hardware and software warranty at the time the related revenue is recognized for hardware warranty we estimate the cost based on historical and projected product failure rate historical and projected repair cost and knowledge of specific product failure if any the specific hardware warranty term and condition vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business but generally include part and labor over period generally ranging from day to three year for software warranty we estimate the cost to provide bug fix such security patch over the estimated life of the software we regularly reevaluate our estimate to ass the adequacy of the recorded warranty liability and adjust the amount necessary research and development research and development expense include payroll employee benefit stock based compensation expense and other headcount related expense associated with product

grant date and recognized expense net of estimated forfeiture over the related service or performance period the fair value of stock award is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date le the present value of expected dividend not received during the vesting period we measure the fair value of psus using monte carlo valuation model compensation cost for rsus is recognized using

the same year the tax effect of such temporary difference is reported deferred income tax deferred tax asset are reported net of valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that tax benefit will not be realized all deferred income tax are classified long term on our consolidated balance sheet fair value measurement we account for certain asset and liability at fair value the hierarchy below list three level of fair value based on the extent to which input used in measuring fair value are observable in the market we categorize each of our fair value measurement in one of these three level based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in it entirety these level are level input are based upon unadjusted quoted price for identical instrument in active market our level non derivative investment primarily include government security domestic and international equity and actively traded mutual fund our level derivative asset and liability include those actively traded on exchange level input are based upon quoted price for similar instrument in active market quoted price for identical or similar instrument in market that are not active and model based valuation technique the black scholes model for which all significant input are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability where applicable these model project future cash flow and discount the future amount to present value using market based observable input including interest rate curve credit spread foreign exchange rate and forward and spot price for currency and commodity our level non derivative investment consist primarily of foreign government bond corporate note and bond mortgage and asset backed security government and agency security common and preferred stock and certificate of deposit our level derivative asset and liability primarily include certain over the counter option and swap contract level input are generally unobservable and typically reflect management estimate of assumption that market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability the fair value are therefore determined using model based technique including option pricing model and discounted cash flow model our level non derivative asset and liability primarily comprise investment in common and preferred stock and goodwill and intangible asset when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge unobservable input used in the model are significant to the fair value of the asset and liability we measure certain asset including our cost and equity method investment at fair value on nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired the fair value of these investment are determined based on valuation technique using the best information available and may include quoted market price market comparables and discounted cash flow projection an impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds it fair value and this condition is determined to be other than temporary our other current financial asset and our current financial liability have fair value that approximate their carrying value financial instrument investment we consider all highly liquid interest earning investment with maturity of three month or le at the date of purchase to be cash equivalent the fair value of these investment approximate their carrying value in general investment with original maturity of greater than three month and remaining maturity of le than one year are classified short term investment investment with maturity beyond one year may be classified short term part ii item based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable security represent the investment of cash that is available for current operation all cash equivalent and short term investment are classified available for sale and realized gain and loss are recorded using the specific identification method change in market value excluding other than temporary impairment are reflected in oci equity and other investment classified long term include both debt and equity instrument debt and publicly traded equity security are classified available for sale and realized gain and loss are recorded using the specific identification method change in the market value of available for sale security excluding other than temporary impairment are reflected in oci common and preferred stock and other investment that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method we lend certain fixed income and equity security to increase investment return these transaction are accounted for secured borrowing and the loaned security continue to be carried investment on our consolidated balance sheet cash and or security interest are received collateral for the loaned security with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower cash received is recorded an asset with corresponding liability investment are considered to be impaired when decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimate determined by management we employ systematic methodology on quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investment if the cost of an investment exceeds it fair value we evaluate among other factor general market condition credit quality of debt instrument issuer the duration and extent to which the fair value is le than cost and for equity security our intent and ability to hold or plan to sell the investment for fixed income security we also evaluate whether we have plan to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery we also consider specific adverse condition related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance change in technology and operational and financing cash flow factor once decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense net and new cost basis in the investment is established derivative derivative instrument are recognized either asset or liability and are measured at fair value the accounting for change in the fair value of

recent accounting guidance accounting for income tax intra entity asset transfer in october the financial accounting standard board fasb issued new guidance requiring an entity to recognize the income tax consequence of an intra entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs rather than when the asset ha been sold to an outside party this guidance is effective for beginning july with early adoption permitted beginning july we plan to adopt the guidance effective july adoption of the guidance will be applied using modified retrospective approach through cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of the effective date cumulative effect adjustment will capture the write off of income tax consequence deferred from past intra entity transfer involving asset other than inventory and new deferred tax asset for amount not recognized under current gaap we anticipate this guidance will have material impact on our consolidated balance sheet upon adoption and continue to evaluate any impact to our accounting policy process and system part ii item financial instrument credit loss in june the fasb issued new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current gaap with methodology that reflects expected credit loss and requires consideration of broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimate we will be required to use forward looking expected credit loss model for account receivables loan and other financial instrument credit loss relating to available for sale debt security will also be recorded through an allowance for credit loss rather than reduction in the amortized cost basis of the security the standard will be effective for beginning july with early adoption permitted beginning july adoption of the standard will be applied using modified retrospective approach through cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of the effective date we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statement including accounting policy process and system lease in february the fasb issued new standard related to lease to increase transparency and comparability among organization by requiring the recognition of right of use rou asset and lease liability on the balance sheet most prominent among the change in the standard is the recognition of rou asset and lease liability by lessee for those lease classified operating lease under current gaap under the standard disclosure are required to meet the objective of enabling user of financial statement to ass the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flow arising from lease we will be required to recognize and measure lease existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented using modified retrospective approach with certain practical expedient available the standard will be effective for beginning july with early adoption permitted we elected to early adopt the standard effective july concurrent with our adoption of the new standard related to revenue recognition we elected the available practical expedient on adoption in preparation for adoption of the standard we have implemented internal control and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information the standard will have material impact on our consolidated balance sheet but will not have material impact on our consolidated income statement the most significant impact will be the recognition of rou asset and lease liability for operating lease while our accounting for capital lease remains substantially unchanged adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of additional rou asset and lease liability for operating lease of billion and billion of june and respectively see expected impact to reported result below for the impact of adoption of the standard on our consolidated financial statement financial instrument recognition measurement presentation and disclosure in january the fasb issued new standard related to certain aspect of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instrument most prominent among the change in the standard is the requirement for change in the fair value of our equity investment with certain exception to be recognized through net income rather than oci the standard will be effective for beginning july adoption of the standard will be applied using modified retrospective approach through cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of the effective date we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statement including accounting policy process and system revenue from contract with customer in may the fasb issued new standard related to revenue recognition under the standard revenue is recognized when customer obtains control of promised good or service in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those good or service in addition the standard requires disclosure of the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flow arising from contract with customer the guidance permit two method of adoption retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented full retrospective method or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application modified retrospective method we will adopt the standard using the full retrospective method to restate each prior reporting period presented part ii item the standard will be effective for beginning july with early adoption permitted we elected to early adopt the standard effective july in preparation for adoption of the standard we have implemented internal control and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information and have reached conclusion on key accounting assessment related to the standard including our assessment that the impact of accounting for cost incurred to obtain contract is immaterial the most significant impact of the standard relates to our accounting for software license revenue specifically for window we will recognize revenue predominantly at the time of billing and delivery rather than ratably over the life of the related device for certain multi year commercial software subscription that include both distinct software license and software assurance we will recognize license revenue at the time of contract execution rather than over the subscription period due to the complexity of certain of our commercial license subscription contract the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract specific term and in some instance may vary from recognition at the time of billing revenue recognition related to our hardware cloud offering such office linkedin and professional service will remain substantially unchanged adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of additional revenue of billion and billion for fiscal year and respectively and an increase in the provision for income tax of billion and billion respectively primarily due to the net change in window revenue recognition in addition adoption of the standard will result in an increase in account receivable and other current and long term asset of billion and billion of june and respectively driven by unbilled receivables from upfront recognition of revenue for certain multi year commercial software subscription that include both distinct software license and software assurance reduction of unearned revenue of billion and billion of june and respectively driven by

our previous phone hardware reporting unit goodwill wa determined to be impaired in the second half of fiscal year phone hardware did not meet it sale volume and revenue goal and the mix of unit sold had lower margin than planned these result along with change in the competitive marketplace and an evaluation of business priority led to shift in strategic direction and reduced future revenue and profitability expectation for the business result of these change in strategy and expectation we forecasted reduction in unit volume growth rate and lower future cash flow used to estimate the fair value of the phone hardware reporting unit which resulted in the determination that an impairment adjustment wa required part ii item because our annual test indicated that phone hardware carrying value exceeded it estimated fair value step of the goodwill impairment test wa performed specific to phone hardware under step the fair value of all phone hardware asset and liability were estimated
