continue to be subject to various united state and foreign law and regulation including those relating to material used in our product and manufacturing process discharge of pollutant into the environment the treatment transport storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and remediation of contamination these law and regulation require our supplier to obtain permit for operation making our product including the discharge of air pollutant and wastewater environmental law are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time for example the european union eu and china are two among growing number of jurisdiction that have enacted restriction on the use of lead and other material in electronic product these regulation affect semiconductor device and packaging number of jurisdiction including the eu australia california and china are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulation for computer and server based on energy star specification well additional energy consumption limit of contentscertain environmental law including the united state comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of or the superfund act impose strict or under certain circumstance joint and several liability on current and previous owner or operator of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substance and impose liability for damage to natural resource these law often impose liability even if the owner or operator not know of or wa not responsible for the release of such hazardous substance these environmental law also ass liability on person who arrange for hazardous substance to be sent to disposal or treatment facility when such facility are found to be contaminated such person can be responsible for cleanup cost even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility we have been named responsible party on superfund clean up order for three site in sunnyvale california that are on the national priority list since we have discovered hazardous material release to the groundwater from former underground tank and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three site the chemical released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the united state in the wafer fabrication process prior to in we received final site clean up requirement order from the california regional water quality control board relating to the three site we have entered into settlement agreement with other responsible party on two of the order during the term of such agreement other party have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable cost well the primary role in conducting remediation activity under the order we remain responsible for additional cost beyond the scope of the agreement well all remaining cost in the event that the other party do not fulfill their obligation under the settlement agreement to address anticipated future remediation cost under the order we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately million and have not recorded any potential insurance recovery in determining the estimated cost of the cleanup the progress of future remediation effort can not be predicted with certainty and these cost may change we believe that any amount in addition

strategic risksintel corporation dominance of the microprocessor market and it aggressive business practice may limit our ability to compete effectively on level playing field intel corporation intel ha been the market share leader for microprocessor for many year intel market share margin and significant financial resource enable it to market it product aggressively to target our customer and our channel partner with special incentive and to influence customer who do business with these aggressive activity have in the past resulted in lower unit sale and lower average selling price for many of our product and adversely affected our margin and profitability intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturer and their channel of distribution through various brand and other marketing program result of intel position in the microprocessor market intel ha been able to control microprocessor and computer system standard and benchmark and to dictate the type of product the microprocessor market requires of intel also dominates the computer system platform which includes core logic chipsets graphic chip networking device wired and wireless non volatile storage and other component necessary to assemble computer system additionally intel is able to drive de facto standard and specification for microprocessor that could cause and other company to have delayed access to such standard long intel remains in this dominant position we may be materially adversely affected by intel business practice including rebating and allocation strategy and pricing action designed to limit our market share and margin product mix and introduction schedule product bundling marketing and merchandising strategy exclusivity payment to it current and potential customer retailer and channel partner de facto control over industry standard and heavy influence on pc manufacturer and other pc industry participant including motherboard memory chipset and basic input output system bios supplier and software company well the graphic interface for intel platform and marketing and advertising expenditure in support of positioning the intel brand over the brand of it original equipment manufacturer oem customer and retailer intel ha substantially greater financial resource than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amount on marketing and research and development than we do we expect intel to continue to invest heavily in marketing research and development new manufacturing facility and other technology company to the extent intel manufacture significantly larger portion of it microprocessor product using more advanced process technology or introduces competitive new product into the market we do we may be more vulnerable to intel aggressive marketing and pricing strategy for microprocessor product intel could also take action that place our discrete graphic processing unit gpus at competitive disadvantage including giving one or more of our competitor in the graphic market such nvidia corporation preferential access to it proprietary graphic interface or other useful information or restricting access to external company also intel ha developed and released their own high end discrete gpus including gaming focused discrete gpus we also compete with intel in field programmable gate array fpgas and adaptive soc product intel position in the microprocessor and integrated graphic chipset market it introduction of competitive new product it existing relationship with top tier oems and it aggressive marketing and pricing strategy could result in lower unit sale and lower average selling price for our product which could have material adverse effect on global economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating result we experienced decline in our client segment revenue result of weak pc market macroeconomic condition and inventory correction action across the pc supply chain in the second half of uncertain global economic condition have and may in the future adversely impact our business uncertainty in the worldwide economic environment or other unfavorable change in economic condition such inflation interest rate or recession may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customer to postpone purchase in addition during challenging economic time our current or potential future customer may experience cash flow problem and result may modify delay or cancel plan to purchase our product additionally if our customer are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of account receivable that they owe the risk related to our customer potentially defaulting on or delaying payment to is increased because we expect that small number of customer will continue to account for substantial part of our revenue any inability of our current or potential future customer to pay for of contentsour product may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow moreover our key supplier may reduce their output or become insolvent thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our product in addition uncertain economic condition may make it more difficult for to raise fund through borrowing or private or public sale of debt or equity security the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and ha experienced severe downturn that have materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our business in the future the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and ha experienced significant downturn often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change wide fluctuation in supply and demand continuous new product introduction price erosion and decline in general economic condition we have incurred substantial loss in previous downturn due to substantial decline in average selling price the cyclical nature of supply and demand imbalance in the semiconductor industry decline in demand for end user product such pc that incorporate our product and excess inventory level industry wide fluctuation in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected in the past and may materially adversely affect in the future global economic uncertainty and weakness have in the past impacted the semiconductor market consumer and business have deferred purchase which negatively impacted demand for our product our financial performance ha been and may in the future be negatively affected by these downturn in the second half of we experienced decline in our client segment revenue result of weak pc market macroeconomic condition and inventory correction action across the pc supply chain the growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our product from high growth adjacent emerging global market our ability to be successful in such market depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure well our ability to cultivate and maintain local relationship in these market if demand from these market is below our expectation sale of our product may decrease which would have material adverse effect on the demand for our product depends in part on the market condition in the industry into which they are sold fluctuation in demand for our product or market decline in any of these industry could have material adverse effect on our result of operation industry wide fluctuation in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected in the past and may materially adversely affect in the future our client segment revenue is focused on the consumer desktop and notebook pc segment which in the second half of experienced decline result of weak pc market macroeconomic condition and inventory correction action across the pc supply chain in the past revenue from the client and gaming segment have experienced decline driven by among other factor the adoption of smaller and other form factor increased competition and change in replacement cycle the success of our semi custom soc product is dependent on securing customer for our semi custom design pipeline and consumer market condition including the success of the sony playstation microsoft xboxtm series and microsoft xboxtm series game console system and next generation console for sony and microsoft worldwide in addition the gpu market ha at time seen elevated demand due to the application of gpu product to cryptocurrency mining for example our gpu revenue ha been affected in part by the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market demand for cryptocurrency ha changed and is likely to continue to change quickly for example china ha banned such activity and corresponding interest in mining of such currency are subject to significant fluctuation alternatively country have created and may continue to create their own cryptocurrencies or equivalent that could also impact interest in mining if we are unable to manage the risk related to the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market our gpu business could be materially adversely affected the loss of significant customer may have material adverse effect on we depend on small number of customer for substantial portion of our business and we expect that small number of customer will continue to account for significant part of our revenue in the future if one of our key customer decides to stop buying our product or if one of these customer materially reduces it operation or it demand for our product our business would be materially adversely affected of contentsthe ongoing novel coronavirus covid pandemic could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation the covid pandemic ha caused government authority to implement numerous public health measure including at various time vaccination and testing requirement and recordkeeping quarantine business closure travel ban and restriction related to social gathering and mobility to contain the virus various state and federal rule are issued and updated on an ongoing basis at time in conflict and or with minimal notice we have experienced and expect to continue to experience disruption to our business these changing measure have and will continue to have an effect on our business operation and practice while our employee gradually return to office we continue to monitor our operation and public health measure implemented by governmental authority in response to covid although some public health measure have eased our effort to reopen our office safely may not be successful and could expose our employee to health risk it is uncertain to when all health measure put in place to attempt to contain the spread of covid will be lifted if are further wave of the virus health measure may be reimplemented and we may need to further limit operation or modify our business practice in manner that may impact our business if our employee are not able to perform their job duty due to self isolation quarantine lockdown measure unavailability of covid test travel restriction or illness reluctance or refusal to vaccinate or are unable to perform them efficiently at home for an extended period of time we may not be able to meet our product schedule roadmaps and customer commitment and we may experience an overall lower productivity of our workforce even when covid health measure are lifted or modified our employee ability or willingness to return to work may delay the return of our full workforce and the resumption of normal business operation covid continues to impact the global supply chain causing disruption to service provider logistics and the flow and availability of supply and product we have experienced some disruption to part of our supply chain result of covid and we adjust our supply chain requirement based on changing customer need and demand we have taken effort to maintain stable supply of material to meet our production requirement through long term purchase commitment and prepayment arrangement with some of our supplier if we are unable to procure stable supply of equipment material or substrate at reasonable cost it could have material adverse effect on our business we may also ass our product schedule and roadmaps to make any adjustment that may be necessary to support remote working requirement and address the geographic and market demand shift caused by covid if the supply of our product to customer is delayed reduced or canceled due to disruption encountered by our third party manufacturer back end manufacturer warehouse partner supplier or vendor result of facility closure border and port restriction or closure transportation delay lockdown measure labor shortage or workforce mobility limitation it could have material adverse effect on our business covid ha in the short term and may in the long term adversely impact the global economy creating uncertainty and potentially leading to an economic downturn this could negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customer to postpone or cancel purchase or delay paying or default on payment of outstanding amount due to which may have material adverse effect on our business even in time of strong demand for our product the worldwide economic environment remains uncertain due to covid and such demand may not be sustainable over the longer term covid ha also led to disruption and volatility in the global capital and financial market while we believe our cash cash equivalent and short term investment along with our revolving credit agreement and cash flow from operation will be sufficient to fund operation including capital expenditure and purchase commitment over the next month and beyond to the extent we may require additional funding to finance our operation and capital expenditure and such funding may not be available to result of contracting capital and financial market resulting from covid it may have an adverse effect on our business the extent to which covid impact our business and financial result will depend on future development which are unpredictable and highly uncertain including the continued spread duration and severity of the outbreak the appearance of new variant of covid the breadth and duration of business disruption related to covid the availability and distribution of effective treatment and vaccine and public health measure and action taken throughout the world to contain covid the prolonged effect of covid could materially adversely impact our business financial condition and result of operation of contentsthe market in which our product are sold are highly competitive the market in which our product are sold are very competitive and delivering the latest and best product to market on timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth we believe that the main factor that determine our product competitiveness are timely product introduction product quality product feature and capability including enabling state of the art visual and virtual reality vr experience energy efficiency including power consumption and battery life reliability processor clock speed performance size or form factor selling price cost adherence to industry standard and the creation of open industry standard level of integration software and hardware compatibility ease of use and functionality of software design tool completeness of applicable software solution security and stability brand recognition and availability we expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological change frequent product introduction by our competitor or new competitor of product that may provide better performance experience or that may include additional feature that render our product comparatively le competitive we may also face aggressive pricing by competitor especially during challenging economic time in addition our competitor have significant marketing and sale resource which could increase the competitive environment in declining market leading to lower price and margin some competitor may have greater access or right to complementary technology including interface processor and memory technical information for instance with our apu product and other competing solution with integrated graphic we believe that demand for additional discrete graphic chip and card may decrease in the future due to improvement in the quality and performance of integrated graphic if competitor introduce competitive new product into the market before demand for our product could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected in addition intel is expanding it position in integrated graphic for the pc market with high end discrete graphic solution for broad range of computing segment which may negatively impact our ability to compete in these computing segment we also face competition from company that use competing computing architecture and platform like the arm architecture increased adoption of arm based semiconductor design could lead to further growth and development of the arm ecosystem in addition we are entering market with current and new competitor who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirement and emerging technology we can not guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitor who may have stronger position in these new market or superior ability to anticipate customer requirement and emerging industry trend furthermore we may face competition from some of our customer who internally develop the same product we may face delay or disruption in research and development effort or we may be required to invest significantly greater resource in research and development than anticipated also the semiconductor industry ha seen several merger and acquisition over the last number of year further consolidation could adversely impact our business due to there being fewer supplier customer and partner in the industry our operating result are subject to quarterly and seasonal sale pattern the profile of our sale may be weighted differently during the year large portion of our quarterly sale have historically been made in the last month of the quarter this uneven sale pattern make prediction of revenue for each financial period difficult and increase the risk of unanticipated variation in quarterly result and financial condition in addition our operating result tend to vary seasonally with the market in which our product are sold for example historically our net revenue ha been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year although market condition and product transition could impact these trend many of the factor that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trend are beyond our control if we can not adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the united state and abroad through patent copyright trade secret trademark and other measure we may lose competitive advantage and incur significant expense we rely on combination of protection provided by contract including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement copyright patent trademark and common law right such trade secret to protect our intellectual property however we can not assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third party infringement or from misappropriation in the united state and abroad any patent licensed by or issued to could be challenged invalidated expire or circumvented or right granted thereunder may not provide competitive advantage to of contentsfurthermore patent application that we file may not result in issuance of patent or if patent is issued the patent may not be issued in form that is advantageous to despite our effort to protect our intellectual property right others may independently develop similar product duplicate our product or design around our patent and other right in addition it is difficult to monitor compliance with and enforce our intellectual property on worldwide basis in cost effective manner in jurisdiction where foreign law provide le intellectual property protection than afforded in the united state and abroad our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised and our business would be materially adversely affected unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuation could adversely affect we have cost asset and liability that are denominated in foreign currency consequence movement in exchange rate could cause our foreign currency denominated expense to increase percentage of revenue affecting our profitability and cash flow whenever we believe appropriate we hedge portion of our foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuation in currency exchange rate we determine our total foreign currency exposure using projection of long term expenditure for item such payroll we can not assure you that these activity will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow in addition the majority of our product sale are denominated in dollar fluctuation in the exchange rate the dollar and the local currency can cause increase or decrease in the cost of our product in the local currency of such customer an appreciation of the dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sale of our product operational and technology riskswe rely on third party to manufacture our product and if they are unable to do so on timely basis in sufficient quantity and using competitive technology our business could be materially adversely affected we utilize third party wafer foundry to fabricate the silicon wafer for all of our product we rely on taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited tsmc for the production of all wafer for microprocessor and gpu product at nanometer nm or smaller node and we rely primarily on globalfoundries inc gf for wafer for microprocessor and gpu product manufactured at process node larger than nm we also utilize tsmc united microelectronics corporation umc and samsung electronics co ltd for our integrated circuit ic in the form of programmable logic device we also rely on third party manufacturer to assemble test mark and pack atmp our product our third party package assembly partner are responsible for packaging technology used to fabricate our product it is important to have reliable relationship with all of these third party manufacturing supplier to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand we can not guarantee that these manufacturer or our other third party manufacturing supplier will be able to meet our near term or long term manufacturing requirement if we experience supply constraint from our third party manufacturing supplier we may be required to allocate the reduced quantity of affected product amongst our customer which could have material adverse effect on our relationship with these customer and on our financial condition in addition if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing supplier it could result in lost sale and have material adverse effect on our business for example if tsmc is not able to manufacture wafer for our microprocessor and gpu product at nm or smaller node and our newest ic product in sufficient quantity to meet customer demand it could have material adverse effect on our business we do not have long term commitment contract with some of our third party manufacturing supplier we obtain some of these manufacturing service on purchase order basis and these manufacturer are not required to provide with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantity in an existing purchase order accordingly we depend on these supplier to allocate to portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our need to produce product of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yield and to deliver those product to on timely basis and at acceptable price the manufacturer we use also fabricate wafer and atmp product for other company including certain of our competitor they could choose to prioritize capacity for other customer increase the price that they charge on short notice require onerous prepayment or reduce or eliminate delivery to which could have material adverse effect on our business of contentsother risk associated with our dependence on third party manufacturer include limited control over delivery schedule yield cycle time quality assurance price increase lack of capacity in period of excess demand misappropriation of our intellectual property dependence on several subcontractor and limited ability to manage inventory and part moreover if any of our third party manufacturer or their subcontractor suffer any damage to facility lose benefit under material agreement experience power outage lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our product encounter financial difficulty are unable to secure necessary raw material from their supplier suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency or experience uncertain social economic or political circumstance or condition we may encounter supply delay or disruption if we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supply of product our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business if we transition the production of some of our product to new manufacturer we may experience delayed product introduction lower yield or poorer performance of our product if we experience problem with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from particular third party manufacturer or if we for other reason cease utilizing one of those manufacturer we may be unable to timely secure an alternative supply for any specific product we could experience significant delay in the shipment of our product if we are required to find alternative third party manufacturer which could have material adverse effect on our business we are party to wafer supply agreement wsa with gf that governs the term by which we purchase product manufactured by gf and this agreement is in place through in may we entered into an amendment to the wsa and in december we further amended these term the amendment under the amendment gf will provide minimum annual capacity allocation to for year through and amd ha corresponding annual wafer purchase target if we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these year we will be required to pay to gf portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchase and the wafer purchase target for that year amd and gf also have agreed to wafer pricing through and amd wa obligated in and is obligated in to pre pay gf certain amount for those wafer the amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitment and provides with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all product manufactured at any technology node if our actual wafer requirement are le than the number of wafer required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit cost both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our result of operation if gf fails to meet it minimum annual capacity allocation obligation we could experience significant delay in the shipment of our product which could have material adverse effect on our business we are party to two atmp joint venture collectively the atmp jv with affiliate of tongfu microelectronics co ltd the majority of our atmp service are provided by the atmp jv and there is no guarantee that the atmp jv will be able to fulfill our long term atmp requirement if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the atmp jv it could result in lost sale and have material adverse effect on our business if essential equipment material substrate or manufacturing process are not available to manufacture our product we could be materially adversely affected we may purchase equipment material and substrate for use by our back end manufacturing service provider from number of supplier and our operation depend upon obtaining delivery of adequate supply of equipment and material on timely basis our third party supplier also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantity of equipment and material in the manufacture of our product in addition many of our product increase in technical complexity we rely on our third party supplier to update their process in order to continue meeting our back end manufacturing need certain equipment and material that are used in the manufacture of our product are available only from limited number of supplier or in some case sole supplier we also depend on limited number of supplier to provide the majority of certain type of integrated circuit package for our microprocessor including our apu product similarly certain non proprietary material or component such memory printed circuit board pcbs interposers substrate and capacitor used in the manufacture of our product are currently available from only limited number of supplier if we are unable to procure stable supply of equipment material or substrate on an ongoing basis and at reasonable cost to meet our production requirement we could experience shortage in equipment material or substrate supply or an increase in production cost which could have material adverse effect on our business we have long term purchase commitment and prepayment arrangement with some of our supplier if the delivery of such supply is delayed or not occur for any reason it could materially impact our ability to procure and process the required volume of supply to meet customer demand conversely decrease in customer demand could result in excess inventory and an increase in our production cost particularly since we have prepayment arrangement with certain supplier of contentsbecause some of the equipment and material that we and our third party manufacturer purchase are complex it is sometimes difficult to substitute one equipment or material supplier for another from time to time supplier may extend lead time limit supply or increase price due to capacity constraint or other factor also some of these material and component may be subject to rapid change in price and availability interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortage and price increase in various essential material dependence on sole supplier or limited number of supplier exacerbates these risk if we are unable to procure certain of these material for our back end manufacturing operation or our third party manufacturer are unable to procure material for manufacturing our product our business would be materially adversely affected failure to achieve expected manufacturing yield for our product could negatively impact our financial result semiconductor manufacturing yield are result of product design process technology and packaging technology which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer and low yield can result from design failure packaging technology failure process technology failure or combination of some or all of these our third party manufacturer are responsible for the process technology used to fabricate silicon wafer if our third party manufacturer experience manufacturing inefficiency or encounter disruption error or difficulty during production we may fail to achieve acceptable yield or we may experience product delivery delay we can not be certain that our third party manufacturer will be able to develop obtain or successfully implement leading edge process or packaging technology needed to manufacture future generation of our product profitably or on timely basis or that our competitor will not develop new technology product or process earlier moreover during period when our third party manufacturer are implementing new process or packaging technology their manufacturing facility may not be fully productive substantial delay in the technology transition to smaller process technology could have material adverse effect on particularly if our competitor transition to more cost effective technology before for example we are presently focusing our nm and lower product microprocessor and gpu portfolio on tsmc process if tsmc is not able to manufacture wafer for our product at nm or smaller node in sufficient quantity to meet customer demand it could have material adverse effect on our business moreover we rely on tsmc umc and our other foundry to produce wafer with competitive performance attribute for our ic product therefore the foundry particularly tsmc which manufacture our newest ic product must be able to transition to advanced manufacturing process technology and increased wafer size produce wafer at acceptable yield and deliver them in timely manner any decrease in manufacturing yield could result in an increase in per unit cost which would adversely impact our gross margin and or force to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customer which could harm our relationship and reputation with our customer and materially adversely affect our business the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce product on timely basis with feature and performance level that provide value to our customer while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transition our success depends to significant extent on the development qualification implementation and acceptance of new product design and improvement that provide value to our customer our ability to develop qualify and distribute and have manufactured new product and related technology to meet evolving industry requirement at price acceptable to our customer and on timely basis are significant factor in determining our competitiveness in our target market consumer have new product feature preference or have different requirement than those consumer in the pc market pc sale could be negatively impacted which could adversely impact our business we can not assure you that our effort to execute our product roadmap will result in innovative product and technology that provide value to our customer if we fail to or are delayed in developing qualifying or shipping new product or technology that provide value to our customer and address these new trend or if we fail to predict which new form factor consumer will adopt and adjust our business accordingly we may lose competitive positioning which could cause to lose market share and require to discount the selling price of our product although we make substantial investment in research and development we can not be certain that we will be able to develop obtain or successfully implement new product and technology on timely basis or that they will be well received by our customer moreover our investment in new product and technology involve certain risk and uncertainty and could disrupt our ongoing business new investment may not generate sufficient revenue may incur unanticipated liability and may divert our limited resource and distract management from our current operation we can not be certain that our ongoing investment in new product and of contentstechnologies will be successful will meet our expectation and will not adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating result delay in developing qualifying or shipping new product can also cause to miss our customer product design window or in some case breach contractual obligation or cause to pay penalty if our customer do not include our product in the initial design of their computer system or product they will typically not use our product in their system or product at least the next design configuration the process of being qualified for inclusion in customer system or product can be lengthy and could cause to further miss cycle in the demand of end user which also could result in loss of market share and harm our business we also depend on the success and timing of our customer platform launch if our customer delay their product launch or if our customer do not effectively market their platform with our product it could result in delay in bringing our product to market and cause to miss cycle in the demand of end user which could materially adversely affect our business in addition market demand requires that product incorporate new feature and performance standard on an industry wide basis over the life of specific product the sale price is typically reduced over time the introduction of new product and enhancement to existing product is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price if we are unable to introduce new product with sufficiently high sale price or to increase unit sale volume capable of offsetting the reduction in the sale price of existing product over time our business could be materially adversely affected our revenue from our semi custom soc product is dependent upon our semi custom soc product being incorporated into customer product and the success of those product the revenue that we receive from our semi custom soc product is in the form of non recurring engineering fee charged to third party for design and development service and revenue received in connection with sale of our semi custom soc product to these third party result our ability to generate revenue from our semi custom product depends on our ability to secure customer for our semi custom design pipeline our customer desire to pursue the project and our semi custom soc product being incorporated into those customer product any revenue from sale of our semi custom soc product is directly related to sale of the third party product and reflective of their success in the market moreover we have no control over the marketing effort of these third party and we can not make any assurance that sale of their product will be successful in current or future year consequently the semi custom soc product revenue expected by may not be fully realized and our operating result may be adversely affected our product may be subject to security vulnerability that could have material adverse effect on the product that we sell are complex and have been and may in the future be subject to security vulnerability that could result in among other thing the loss corruption theft or misuse of confidential data or system performance issue our effort to prevent and address security vulnerability may decrease performance be only partially effective or not successful at all we may depend on vendor to create mitigation to their technology that we incorporate into our product and they may delay or decline to make such mitigation we may also depend on third party such customer and end user to deploy our mitigation alone or part of their own mitigation and they may delay decline or modify the implementation of such mitigation our relationship with our customer could be adversely affected some of our customer may stop purchasing our product reduce or delay future purchase of our product or use competing product any of these action by our customer could adversely affect our revenue we have and may in the future be subject to claim and litigation related to security vulnerability actual or perceived security vulnerability of our product may subject to adverse publicity damage to our brand and reputation and could materially harm our business or financial result it outage data loss data breach and cyber attack could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our business reputation and operation in the ordinary course of our business we maintain sensitive data on our information technology it asset and also may maintain sensitive information on our business partner and third party provider it asset including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customer and business partner the white house sec and other regulator have also increased their focus on company cybersecurity vulnerability and risk maintaining the security of this information is important to our business and reputation amd and company like amd and our vendor and customer have been increasingly subject to cybersecurity attempt and threat the increased prevalence of work from home arrangement at amd of contentsand our provider ha presented additional operational risk and cybersecurity attack vector to our it system these threat can come from variety of source all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker or insider threat to state sponsored attack cyber threat may be generic or they may be custom crafted against our information system cyber threat have and may come into our network through malicious code that is added to widely available open source software compromised commercial software or security vulnerability in our product or those of third party that are being used by attacker prior to mitigation being put in place such zero day attack cyber attack have and may come into our it system through the compromise of our user access credential user access credential can be compromised by phishing vishing smishing multi factor authentication mfa prompt bombing hacking or other social engineering cybersecurity or theft activity cyber attack have become increasingly more prevalent and much harder to detect defend against or prevent and have and may cause disruption to our business our network and storage application well those of our customer business partner and third party provider may be subject to unauthorized access by hacker or breached due to operator error malfeasance or other system disruption it is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incident and the damage caused by such incident it also may not be possible to determine the root cause of such incident or mitigate quickly enough to stop an attack these data breach and any unauthorized access misuse or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information or personally identifiable information cyber attack on or our customer business partner or third party provider could also cause to incur significant remediation cost result in product development delay disrupt key business operation and divert attention of management and key information technology resource these incident could also subject to liability expose to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business we also maintain confidential and personally identifiable information about our worker and consumer the confidentiality and integrity of our worker and consumer data is important to our business and our worker and consumer have high expectation that we adequately protect their personal information in addition many government have enacted law around personally identifiable information such the european union general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act and failure to comply or breach of personally identifiable information could result in sanction or other action by the government or litigation by other entity we anticipate ongoing and increasing cost related to enhancing and implementing information security control including cost related to upgrading application computer and network security component training worker to maintain and monitor our security control investigating responding to and remediating any data security breach and addressing any related litigation mitigating reputational harm and complying with external regulation we often partner with third party provider for certain worker service and we may provide certain limited worker information to such third party based on the scope of the service provided to we also provide sensitive information to vendor customer and contractor if these third party fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practice or in the event of breach of their network our worker data and sensitive information may be improperly accessed used or disclosed breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operation failure to adequately maintain and update our security system could materially adversely affect our operation and our ability to maintain worker confidence failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information it outage data loss and data breach could materially adversely affect our financial condition our competitive position and operating result we may encounter difficulty in upgrading and operating our new enterprise resource planning system which could materially adversely affect we are currently upgrading our enterprise resource planning erp system to help manage our operation and financial reporting the adoption of new erp system is major undertaking and pose several challenge both financially and from management and personnel perspective cost and risk inherent in the conversion to our upgraded and new system may include disruption to business continuity difficulty in maintaining effective internal control administrative and technical problem interruption or delay in sale process expenditure overrun and data migration issue if we do not properly address or mitigate these issue it could result in increased cost and the diversion of management attention and resource negatively impacting our operating result and ability to effectively manage our business moreover our erp system is upgraded it may not operate we expect it to of contentsand cause disruption to our operation there are no assurance that our new erp system will be successfully implemented and the failure to do so could have material adverse effect on our business uncertainty involving the ordering and shipment of our product could materially adversely affect we typically sell our product pursuant to individual purchase order we generally do not have long term supply arrangement with our customer or minimum purchase requirement except that order generally must be for standard pack quantity generally our customer may cancel order for standard product more than day prior to shipment without incurring significant fee we base our inventory level in part on customer estimate of demand for their product which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our product that our customer will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our product are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributor and customer our forecast for demand are based on estimate provided by multiple party throughout the downstream channel for instance we have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our product to the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is mismatch between supply and demand for our product it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have material adverse effect on our business many of our market are characterized by short product lifecycles which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion in addition our customer may change their inventory practice on short notice for any reason for example in the second half of we experienced decline in our client segment revenue result of weak pc market macroeconomic condition and inventory correction action across the pc supply chain we may build inventory during period of anticipated growth and the cancellation or deferral of product order or overproduction due to failure of anticipated order to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory which could result in write down of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margin our customer may also experience shortage of or delay in receiving certain component to build their product which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our product for instance oems have and continue to experience industry wide challenge securing matched component set to build their product excess or obsolete inventory have and may in the future result in write down of the value of our inventory for example in the third quarter of we recorded certain charge primarily for inventory pricing and related reserve in the gaming and client segment other factor that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include reduction in the average selling price or reduction in our gross margin include sudden or significant decrease in demand for our product production or design defect in our product higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirement failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our product including for our older product our new product are introduced or our competitor introducing new product or taking aggressive pricing action our ability to design and introduce new product in timely manner includes use of third party intellectual property in the design and development of new and enhanced product we rely on third party intellectual property such development and testing tool for software and hardware furthermore certain product feature may rely on intellectual property acquired from third party the design requirement necessary to meet customer demand for more feature and greater functionality from semiconductor product may exceed the capability of the third party intellectual property or development or testing tool available to if the third party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame manufacturing technology or price point needed for our new product or fails to produce design that meet customer demand or law are adopted that affect our use of third party intellectual property in certain region or product our business could be materially adversely affected we depend on third party company for the design manufacture and supply of motherboards software memory and other computer platform component to support our business and product we depend on third party company for the design manufacture and supply of motherboards graphic card software bios operating system driver memory and other component that we use to design support and sell and our customer utilize to support and or use our product offering we also rely on our aib partner to support our product in addition our microprocessor are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with intel microprocessor if the designer manufacturer aibs and supplier of motherboards graphic card software memory and other component cease or reduce their design manufacture or production of contentsof current or future product that are based on utilized in or support our product or law are adopted that result in the same our business could be materially adversely affected if we lose microsoft corporation support for our product or other software vendor do not design and develop software to run on our product our ability to sell our product could be materially adversely affected our ability to innovate beyond the instruction set controlled by intel depends partially on microsoft designing and developing it operating system to run on or support our based microprocessor product with respect to our graphic product we depend in part on microsoft to design and develop it operating system to run on or support our graphic product similarly the success of our product in the market such our apu product is dependent on independent software provider designing and developing software to run on our product if microsoft doe not continue to design and develop it operating system so that they work with our instruction set or doe not continue to develop and maintain their operating system to support our graphic product independent software provider may forego designing their software application to take advantage of our innovation and customer may not purchase pc with our product in addition some software driver licensed for use with our product are certified by microsoft if microsoft did not certify driver or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of microsoft or other software vendor our ability to market our product would be materially adversely affected our reliance on third party distributor and aib partner subject to certain risk we market and sell our product directly and through third party distributor and aib partner pursuant to agreement that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party these agreement are non exclusive and permit both our distributor and aib partner to offer our competitor product we are dependent on our distributor and aib partner to supplement our direct marketing and sale effort if any significant distributor or aib partner or substantial number of our distributor or aib partner terminated their relationship with decided to market our competitor product over our product or decided not to market our product at all our ability to bring our product to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected in addition if we are unable to collect account receivable from our significant distributor and or aib partner it could have material adverse effect on our business if we are unable to manage the risk related to the use of our third party distributor and aib partner or offer appropriate incentive to focus them on the sale of our product our business could be materially adversely affected additionally distributor and aib partner typically maintain an inventory of our product in most instance our agreement with distributor protect their inventory of our product against price reduction well provide return right for any product that we have removed from our price book that is le than month older than the manufacturing date some agreement with our distributor also contain standard stock rotation provision permitting limited level of product return our agreement with aib partner protect their inventory of our product against price reduction in the event of significant decline in the price of our product the price protection right we offer would materially adversely affect because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business process and information system and modification or interruption of such system may disrupt our business process and internal control we rely upon number of internal business process and information system to support key business function and the efficient operation of these process and system is critical to our business our business process and information system need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modification or upgrade that expose to number of operational risk such our information system will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business need these change may be costly and disruptive to our operation and could impose substantial demand on management time these change may also require change in our information system modification of internal control procedure and significant training of employee and third party resource we continuously work on simplifying our information system and application through consolidation and standardization effort there can be no assurance that our business and operation will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition our information technology system and those of third party information technology provider or business partner may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstance beyond our control including catastrophic event of contentspower anomaly or outage natural disaster virus or malware cyber attack insider threat attack unauthorized system or data modification data breach and computer system or network failure exposing to significant cost reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business in addition our it environment continues to evolve we are embracing new way of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customer and partner using method such mobility and the cloud that can promote business efficiency however these practice can also result in more distributed it environment making it more difficult for to maintain visibility and control over internal and external user and meet scalability and administrative requirement if our security control can not keep pace with the speed of these change or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirement our business would be materially adversely affected if our product are not compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware we could be materially adversely affected our product may not be fully compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware further we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problem in timely manner if our customer are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware we could be materially adversely affected in addition the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our product could have material adverse effect on our business cost related to defective product could have material adverse effect on product complex those we offer may contain defect or failure when first introduced or when new version or enhancement to existing product are released we can not assure you that despite our testing procedure error will not be found in new product or release after commencement of commercial shipment in the future which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our product material recall and replacement cost loss of revenue writing the inventory of defective product the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development effort defending against litigation related to defective product or related liability including property damage personal injury damage to our reputation in the industry and loss of data or intangible property and could adversely affect our relationship with our customer in addition we may have difficulty identifying the end customer of the defective product in the field result we could incur substantial cost to implement modification to correct defect any of these problem could materially adversely affect our business we could be subject to potential product liability claim if one of our product cause or merely appears to have caused an injury whether tangible or intangible claim may be made by consumer or others selling our product and we may be subject to claim against even if an alleged injury is due to the action of others product liability claim recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liability or for amount in excess of insured liability could have material adverse effect on our business if we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain we respond to change in customer demand for our product our business could be materially adversely affected our ability to meet customer demand for our product depends in part on our ability to deliver the product our customer want on timely basis accordingly we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing distribution and fulfillment of our product we continue to grow our business expand to high growth adjacent market acquire new customer and strengthen relationship with existing customer the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because many of our customer tend to have specific requirement for particular product geographic requirement and specific time frame in which they require delivery of these product if we are unable to consistently deliver the right product to our customer on timely basis in the right location our customer may reduce the quantity they order from which could have material adverse effect on our business of contentswe outsource to third party certain supply chain logistics function including portion of our product distribution transportation management and information technology support service we rely on third party provider to operate our regional product distribution center and to manage the transportation of our work in process and finished product among our facility to our third party manufacturer and to our customer in addition we rely on third party to provide certain information technology service to including help desk support desktop application service business and software support application server and storage administration data center operation database administration and voice video and remote access we can not guarantee that these provider will fulfill their respective responsibility in timely manner in accordance with the contract term in which case our internal operation and the distribution of our product to our customer could be materially adversely affected also we can not guarantee that our contract with these third party provider will be renewed in which case we would have to transition these function in house or secure new provider which could have material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately our inability to effectively control the sale of our product on the gray market could have material adverse effect on we market and sell our product directly to oems and through authorized third party distributor from time to time our product are diverted from our authorized distribution channel and are sold on the gray market gray market product result in shadow inventory that is not visible to thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately also when gray market product enter the market we and our distribution channel compete with these heavily discounted gray market product which adversely affect demand for our product and negatively impact our margin in addition our inability to control gray market activity could result in customer satisfaction issue because any time product are purchased outside our authorized distribution channel there is risk that our customer are buying counterfeit or substandard product including product that may have been altered mishandled or damaged or are used product represented new legal and regulatory risksgovernment action and regulation such export regulation tariff and trade protection measure may limit our ability to export our product to certain customer we have equity interest in two joint venture collectively the thatic jv with higon information technology co ltd thatic third party chinese entity in june the bureau of industry and security bi of the united state department of commerce added certain chinese entity to the entity list including thatic and the thatic jv since that time the united state administration ha called for change to domestic and foreign policy including policy with respect to china and russia specifically united state china trade relation remain uncertain the united state continues to add more chinese company to the entity list and more regulation targeted to advanced computing semiconductor manufacturing and ai further the united state and other country and coalition have issued sanction and revision to export control and other regulation against russia belarus or the dnr or lnr region of ukraine due to the conflict in ukraine bi ha issued new requirement that prevent from shipping and integrated circuit to china and russia without license bi may possibly issue new licensing requirement and regulatory control in the future significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any tariff trade protection measure or restriction could result in lost sale adversely impacting our reputation and business there is also possibility of future tariff trade protection measure import or export regulation or other restriction imposed on our product or on our customer by the united state china or other country that could have material adverse effect on our business export control restriction may adversely impact the ability of our research and development team located outside of the united state from executing our product roadmaps

granted increase the difficulty of forecasting shipment in addition security or compliance program failure that could result in penalty or loss of export privilege well stringent licensing restriction that may make our product le attractive to overseas customer could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and or operating result of contentsif we can not realize our deferred tax asset our result of operation could be adversely affected our deferred tax asset include net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income tax payable in future period each quarter we consider both positive and negative evidence to determine whether all or portion of the deferred tax asset are more likely than not to be realized if we determine that some or all of our deferred tax asset are not realizable it could result in material expense in the period in which this determination is made which may have material adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation in addition significant amount of our deferred tax asset related to net operating loss or tax credit which remain under valuation allowance could be subject to limitation under internal revenue code section or separate return loss year rule or dual consolidated loss rule the limitation could reduce our ability to utilize the net

operating structure intercompany arrangement and tax planning strategy our income tax expense is computed based on tax rate at the time of the respective financial period our future effective tax rate financial condition and result from operation could be unfavorably affected by change in the tax rate in jurisdiction where our income is earned by change in the tax rule and regulation or the interpretation of tax rule and regulation in the jurisdiction in which we do business or by change in the valuation of our deferred tax asset in addition we are subject to examination of our income tax return by domestic and foreign tax authority we regularly ass the likelihood of outcome resulting from these examination to determine the adequacy of our provision for income tax and have reserved for potential adjustment that may result from the current examination there can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examination will not have an adverse effect on our effective tax rate financial condition and result of operation in the ordinary course of our business there are many transaction and calculation where the ultimate income tax indirect tax or other tax determination is uncertain although we believe our tax estimate are reasonable we can not assure that the final determination of any tax audit or litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical tax provision and accrual should additional tax be assessed result of an audit assessment or litigation there could be material adverse effect on our cash tax provision and net income in the period or period for which that determination is made we are party to litigation and may become party to other claim or litigation that could cause to incur substantial cost or pay substantial damage or prohibit from selling our product from time to time we are defendant or plaintiff in various legal action described in note contingency of the note to our consolidated financial statement for example we have been subject to certain claim concerning federal security law and corporate governance our product are purchased by and or used by consumer which could increase our exposure to consumer action such product liability claim and consumer class action claim on occasion we receive claim that individual were allegedly exposed to substance used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facility and that this alleged exposure caused harm litigation can involve complex factual and legal question and it outcome is uncertain it is possible that if claim is successfully asserted against it could result in the payment of damage that could be material to our business of contentswith respect to intellectual property litigation from time to time we have been notified of or third party may bring or have brought action against and or against our customer based on allegation that we are infringing the intellectual property right of others contributing to or inducing the infringement of the intellectual property right of others improperly claiming ownership of intellectual property or otherwise improperly using the intellectual property of others if any such claim are asserted we may seek to obtain license under the third party intellectual property right we can not assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary license on satisfactory term if at all these party may file lawsuit against or our customer seeking damage potentially up to and including treble damage or an injunction against the sale of product that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business presently conducted which could result in our to stop the sale of some of our product or to increase the cost of selling some of our product or which could damage our reputation the award of damage including material royalty payment or other type of damage or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our product could have material adverse effect on we could decide in the alternative to redesign our product or to resort to litigation to challenge such claim such challenge could be extremely expensive and time consuming regardless of their merit could cause delay in product release or shipment and or could have material adverse effect on we can not assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property right or the intellectual property right of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded even if we were to prevail any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operation which could have material adverse effect on we are subject to environmental law conflict mineral related provision of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act well variety of other law or regulation that could result in additional cost and liability our operation and property have in the past been and continue to be subject to various united state and foreign law and regulation including those relating to material used in our product and manufacturing process discharge of pollutant into the environment the treatment transport storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and remediation of contamination for the manufacturing of our product these law and regulation require our supplier to obtain permit for operation including the discharge of air pollutant and wastewater although our management system are designed to oversee our supplier compliance we can not assure you that our supplier have been or will be at all time in complete compliance with such law regulation and permit if our supplier violate or fail to comply with any of them range of consequence could result including fine suspension of production alteration of manufacturing process import export restriction sale limitation criminal and civil liability or other sanction such non compliance from our manufacturing supplier could result in disruption in supply higher sourcing cost and or reputational damage for we could also be held liable for any and all consequence arising out of exposure to hazardous material used stored released disposed of by or located at under or emanating from our current or former facility or other environmental or natural resource damage while we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditure we can not assure you that future environmental legal requirement will not become more stringent or costly in the future therefore we can not assure you that our cost of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety law and our liability arising from past and future release of or exposure to hazardous substance will not have material adverse effect on environmental law are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time for example the european union eu and china are two among growing number of jurisdiction that have enacted restriction on the use of lead and other material in electronic product these regulation affect semiconductor device and packaging regulation restricting material in electronic product continue to increase around the world there is risk that the cost quality and manufacturing yield of product that are subject to these restriction may be le favorable compared to product that are not subject to such restriction or that the transition to compliant product may not meet customer roadmaps or produce sudden change in demand which may result in excess inventory number of jurisdiction including the eu australia california and china are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulation for computer and server based on energy star specification well additional energy consumption limit there is the potential for certain of our product being excluded from some of these market which could materially adversely affect of contentscertain environmental law including the united state comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of or the superfund act impose strict or under certain circumstance joint and several liability on current and previous owner or operator of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substance and impose liability for damage to natural resource these law often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or wa not responsible for the release of such hazardous substance these environmental law also ass liability on person who arrange for hazardous substance to be sent to disposal or treatment facility when such facility are found to be contaminated such person can be responsible for cleanup cost even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility we have been named responsible party at three superfund site in sunnyvale california although we have not been we could be named potentially responsible party at other superfund or contaminated site in the future in addition contamination that ha not been identified could exist at our other facility under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the sec adopted disclosure and reporting requirement for company that use conflict mineral originating from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining country we continue to incur additional cost associated with complying with these requirement such cost related to developing internal control for the due diligence process determining the source of any conflict mineral used in our product auditing the process and reporting to our customer and the sec in addition to the sec regulation the european union china and other jurisdiction are developing new policy focused on conflict mineral that may impact and increase the cost of our compliance program customer are increasingly seeking information about the source of mineral used in our supply chain beyond those addressed in law and regulation given the complexity of mineral supply chain we may face reputational challenge if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origin of the subject mineral moreover we are likely to encounter challenge to satisfy those customer who require that all of the component of our product be certified conflict free if we can not satisfy these customer they may choose competitor product in addition to our company customer government and authority continue to be focused on eliminating risk of forced labor in supply chain which may increase the cost of our compliance program for example the united state uyghur forced labor prevent act prohibits good mined produced or manufactured wholly or in part in the xinjiang uyghur autonomous region of the people republic of china or by certain entity from entering the united state under the presumption of being made with forced labor germany federal procurement office in collaboration with the bitkom trade association ha issued supply chain labor requirement in addition the united kingdom australia and the state of california have enacted law that require to disclose our policy and practice for identifying and eliminating forced labor and human trafficking in our supply chain several customer have also issued expectation to eliminate these occurrence if any that may impact while we have human right policy and management system to identify and avoid these practice in our supply chain we can not guarantee that our supplier will always be in conformance to these law and expectation we may face enforcement liability and reputational challenge if we are unable to sufficiently meet these expectation moreover we are likely to encounter challenge with customer if we can not satisfy their forced and trafficked labor police and they may choose competitor product merger acquisition and integration risksacquisitions joint venture and or investment and the failure to integrate acquired business could disrupt our business and or dilute or adversely affect the price of our common stock our success will depend in part on our ability to expand our product offering and grow our business in response to changing technology customer demand and competitive pressure in some circumstance we may pursue growth through the acquisition of complementary business solution or technology or through joint venture or investment rather than through internal development the identification of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidate can be difficult time consuming and costly and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisition or joint venture of contentsfor example on february we completed our acquisition of xilinx and on may we completed our acquisition of pensando while we believe these acquisition will result in certain benefit including certain operational synergy and cost efficiency and drive product innovation achieving these anticipated benefit will depend on successfully combining our and the acquired company business together it is not certain that the acquired company can be successfully integrated with our business in timely manner or at all or that any of the anticipated benefit will be realized for variety of reason including but not limited to our inability to integrate or benefit from acquired technology or service in profitable manner diversion of capital and other resource including management attention from our existing business unanticipated cost or liability associated with the integration failure to leverage the increased scale of the combined business quickly and effectively coordinating and integrating in country in which we have not previously operated the potential impact of the acquisition on our relationship with employee vendor supplier and customer the impairment of relationship with or the loss of the acquired company employee vendor supplier and customer adverse change in general economic condition in region in which we and the acquired company operate potential litigation associated with the acquisition difficulty in the assimilation of employee and culture difficulty in managing the expanded operation of larger and more complex company challenge in attracting and retaining key personnel and difficulty with integrating and upgrading our and the acquired company financial reporting system many of these factor will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased cost decrease in expected revenue and diversion of management time and attention which could materially impact the combined company in addition even if the operation of the business are integrated successfully the full benefit of the acquisition may not be realized within the anticipated time frame or at all all of these factor could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and negatively impact the combined company if we can not successfully integrate our and the acquired company business and operation or if there are delay in combining the business it could negatively impact our ability to develop or sell new product and impair our ability to grow our business which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and operating result acquisition and joint venture may also involve the entry into geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience consequently we may not achieve anticipated benefit of acquisition or joint venture which could harm our operating result in addition to complete an acquisition we may issue equity security which would dilute our stockholder ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock and or incur debt assume contingent liability or have amortization expense and write down of acquired asset which could adversely affect our result of operation moreover if such acquisition or joint venture require to seek additional debt or equity financing we may not be able to obtain such financing on term favorable to or at all even if we successfully complete an acquisition or joint venture we may not be able to assimilate and integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired business technology solution asset personnel or operation particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for acquisition and joint venture may also reduce our cash available for operation and other us which could harm our business also any failure on our part to effectively evaluate and execute new business initiative could adversely affect our business we may not adequately ass the risk of new business initiative and subsequent event may arise that alter the risk that were initially considered furthermore we may not achieve the objective and expectation with respect to future operation product and service the majority of our atmp service are provided by the atmp jv and there is no guarantee that the jv will be able to fulfill our long term atmp requirement if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the atmp jv it could result in lost sale and have material adverse effect on our business in addition we may not realize the anticipated benefit from our business initiative for example we may not realize the expected benefit from the thatic jv expected future performance including the receipt of any future milestone payment and any royalty from certain licensed intellectual property in june the bi added certain chinese entity to the entity list including thatic and the thatic jv we are complying with law pertaining to the entity list designation of contentsany impairment of our tangible definite lived intangible or indefinite lived intangible asset including goodwill may adversely impact our financial position and result of operation we account for certain acquisition including the xilinx and pensando acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under the provision of asc business combination with amd representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance we record asset acquired including identifiable intangible asset and liability assumed at their respective fair value at the acquisition date any excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of such asset and liability will be recorded goodwill in connection with the xilinx and pensando acquisition we recorded significant goodwill and other intangible asset on our consolidated balance sheet indefinite lived intangible asset including goodwill are tested for impairment at least annually and all tangible and intangible asset including goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicator are present if in the future we determine that tangible or intangible asset including goodwill are impaired we would record an impairment charge at that time impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment and assumption particularly it relates to the determination of fair value subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis we monitor for any event or change in circumstance such significant adverse change in business climate or operating result change in management business strategy an inability to successfully introduce new product in the marketplace an inability to successfully achieve internal forecast or significant decline in our stock price which may represent an indicator of impairment decrease in the long term economic outlook and future cash flow of our business could significantly impact asset value and potentially result in the impairment of goodwill and may require to record future goodwill impairment charge which may have material adverse impact

the introduction of the amd radeon pro graphic card built on amd rdna architecture although the current covid pandemic continues to impact our business operation and practice we experienced limited disruption during we continue to monitor our operation and public health measure implemented by governmental authority in response to the pandemic we intend the discussion of our financial condition and result of operation that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statement the change in certain key item in those financial statement from period to period the primary factor that resulted in those change and how certain accounting principle policy and estimate affect our financial statement of contentscritical accounting estimatesour discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle gaap the preparation of our financial statement requires to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount in our consolidated financial statement we evaluate our estimate on an on going basis including those related to our revenue inventory business combination goodwill long lived and intangible asset and income tax we base our estimate on historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability although actual result have historically been reasonably consistent with management expectation the actual result may differ from these estimate or our estimate may be affected by different assumption or condition management belief the following critical accounting estimate are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statement and require the most difficult subjective and complex judgment revenue allowance revenue contract with our customer include variable amount which we evaluate under asc through in order to determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled and which we recognize revenue we determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer after adjustment to the contract price for right of return and rebate to our original equipment manufacturer oem customer and right of return rebate and price protection on unsold merchandise to our distributor customer we base our determination of necessary adjustment to the contract price by reference to actual historical activity and experience including actual historical return rebate and credit issued to oem and distributor customer adjusted applicable to include adjustment if any for known event or current economic condition or both our estimate of necessary adjustment for distributor price incentive and price protection on unsold product held by distributor are based on actual historical incentive provided to distributor customer and known future price movement based on our internal and external market data analysis our estimate of necessary adjustment for oem price incentive utilize in addition to known pricing agreement actual historical rebate attainment rate and estimate of future oem rebate program attainment based on internal and external market data analysis we offer incentive program through cooperative advertising and marketing promotion where fund provided for such program can be estimated we recognize reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized otherwise we recognize such reduction to revenue at the later of when the related revenue transaction occurs or ii the program is offered for transaction where we reimburse customer for portion of the customer cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activity such amount are recognized reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition we also provide limited product return right to certain oems and to most distribution customer these return right are generally limited to contractual percentage of the customer prior quarter shipment although from time to time we may approve additional product return beyond the contractual arrangement based on the applicable fact and circumstance in order to estimate adjustment to revenue to account for these return including product restocking right provided to distributor and oem customer we utilize relevant trended actual historical product return rate information gathered adjusted for actual known information or event applicable overall our estimate of adjustment to contract price due to variable consideration under our contract with oem and distributor customer based on our assumption and include adjustment if any for known event have been materially consistent with actual result however these estimate are subject to management judgment and actual provision could be different from our estimate and current provision resulting in future adjustment to our revenue and operating result of contentsinventory valuation we value inventory at standard cost adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumption about future demand and market condition material assumption we use to estimate necessary inventory carrying value adjustment can be unique to each product and are based on specific fact and circumstance in determining excess or obsolescence reserve for product we consider assumption such change in business and economic condition other than temporary decrease in demand for our product and change in technology or customer requirement in determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserve we consider assumption such recent historical sale activity and selling price well estimate of future selling price if in any period we anticipate change in assumption such future demand or market condition to be le favorable than our previous estimate additional inventory write down may be required and would be reflected in cost of sale resulting in negative impact to our gross margin in that period if in any period we are able to sell inventory that had been written down to level below the ultimate realized selling price in previous period related revenue would be recorded with lower or no offsetting charge to cost of sale resulting in net benefit to our gross margin in that period overall our estimate of inventory carrying value adjustment have been materially consistent with actual result business combination we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible asset acquired liability assumed and intangible asset acquired based on their estimated fair value the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these identifiable asset and liability is recorded goodwill such valuation require management to make significant estimate and assumption especially with respect to intangible asset significant estimate in valuing developed technology in process research and development customer relationship and other identifiable intangible asset include but are not limited to expected future revenue growth rate and margin future change in technology time to recreate customer relationship useful life and discount rate management estimate of fair value are based upon assumption believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and result actual result may differ from estimate allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable asset and liability affect our amortization expense acquired finite lived intangible asset are amortized over the useful life whereas any indefinite lived intangible asset including goodwill are not amortized during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustment to the asset acquired and liability assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustment are recorded to earnings goodwill goodwill is the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the identifiable asset acquired and liability assumed in connection with business combination our reporting unit are at the operating segment level our goodwill is contained within three reporting unit data center gaming and embedded we perform our goodwill impairment analysis of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and if certain event or circumstance indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred on more frequent basis the analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factor to ass the likelihood of an impairment which occurs when the carrying value of reporting unit exceeds it fair value significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of our reporting unit to determine if the fair value of those unit exceed their carrying value and an impairment to goodwill is required when quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed we typically obtain the assistance of third party valuation specialist to help in determining the fair value of our reporting unit the fair value of our reporting unit are estimated using combination of the income approach which requires estimating the present value of expected future cash flow of reporting unit and the market approach which us financial ratio of comparable company to arrive at an estimated value for the reporting unit significant estimate and assumption used in the income approach include assessment of macroeconomic condition growth rate of our reporting unit in the near and long term expectation of our ability to execute on our roadmap and projection and the discount rate applied to cash flow significant estimate used in the market approach include the identification of comparable company for each reporting unit the determination of an appropriate control premium that market participant would apply to reporting unit and the determination of appropriate multiple to apply to reporting unit based on adjustment and consideration of specific attribute of that reporting unit of contentsthe most significant assumption utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of our reporting unit are the sale and earnings growth rate including long term growth rate and discount rate long term growth rate are dependent on overall market growth rate the competitive environment and inflation result long term growth rate could be adversely impacted by sustained deceleration in category growth or an increased competitive environment discount rate which are consistent with weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by market participant are based upon industry required rate of return including consideration of both debt and equity component of the capital structure our discount rate may be impacted by adverse change in the macroeconomic environment prolonged and continuing inflationary pressure volatility in the equity and debt market and other factor that otherwise create or exacerbate risk in our reporting unit change in operating plan or adverse change in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flow used to estimate fair value and could result in decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charge of our reporting unit goodwill based on our annual impairment testing the fair value of all of our reporting unit exceeded their carrying value long lived and intangible asset long lived and intangible asset to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicator of potential impairment exist and at least annually for indefinite lived intangible asset impairment indicator are reviewed on quarterly basis asset are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flow when indicator of impairment exist and asset are held for use we estimate future undiscounted cash flow attributable to the related asset group in the event such cash flow are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the asset the asset are written down to their estimated fair value based on the expected discounted future cash flow attributable to the asset group or based on appraisal factor affecting impairment of asset held for use include the ability of the specific asset to generate separately identifiable positive cash flow when asset are removed from operation and held for sale we estimate impairment loss the excess of the carrying value of the asset over their fair value market condition are among the factor affecting impairment of asset held for sale change in any of these factor could necessitate impairment recognition in future period for asset held for use or asset held for sale income tax in determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purpose we must make certain estimate and judgment these estimate and judgment are applied in the calculation of certain tax liability and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax asset which arise from temporary difference between the recognition of asset and liability for tax and financial statement reporting purpose we regularly ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset unless recovery is considered more likely than not probability level of more than we will record charge to income tax expense in the form of valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior period when considering all available evidence if we determine it is more likely than not we will realize our deferred tax asset we will reverse some or all of the existing valuation allowance which would result in credit to income tax expense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal in determining the need to establish or maintain valuation allowance we consider the four source of jurisdictional taxable income carryback of net operating loss to prior year ii future reversal of existing taxable temporary difference iii viable and prudent tax planning strategy and iv future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary difference and carryforwards through the end of we continue to maintain valuation allowance of approximately billion for certain federal state and foreign tax attribute the federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitation under internal revenue code section or separate return loss year rule or dual consolidated loss rule certain state and foreign valuation allowance are maintained due to lack of sufficient source of future taxable income in addition the calculation of our tax liability involves addressing uncertainty in the application of complex multi jurisdictional tax rule and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax position by the internal revenue service or other taxing authority of contentsresults of operationsduring the second quarter of fiscal year we changed our reporting segment to align our financial reporting with how we manage our

off balance sheet arrangement of contentsitem quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for change in interest rate relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt we usually invest our cash in investment with short maturity or with frequent interest reset term accordingly our interest income fluctuates with short term market condition of december our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income instrument time deposit and commercial paper our primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity need in accordance with our investment policy we place investment with high credit quality issuer and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer based upon the issuer credit rating these security are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rate increase hypothetical basis point half percentage point increase or decrease in interest rate compared to rate at december would have affected the fair value of our cash equivalent and investment portfolio by approximately million of december all of our outstanding long term debt had fixed interest rate consequently our exposure to market risk for change in interest rate on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flow is minimal we will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk default risk we mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality security and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to significant reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor our portfolio includes investment in marketable debt security with active secondary or resale market to ensure portfolio liquidity we are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested fund by limiting default risk and market risk we actively monitor market condition and development specific to the security and security class in which we invest we believe that we take conservative approach to investing our fund in that we invest only in highly rated debt security with relatively short maturity and do not invest in security which we believe involve higher degree of risk of december substantially all of our investment in debt security were rated by at least one of the rating agency while we believe we take prudent measure to mitigate investment related risk such risk can not be fully eliminated there are circumstance outside of our control foreign exchange risk
