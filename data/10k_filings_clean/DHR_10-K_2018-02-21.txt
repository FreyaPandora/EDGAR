business the type of claim made in lawsuit include claim for compensatory damage punitive and consequential damage and in some case treble damage and or injunctive relief the defense of these lawsuit

previously not susceptible of reasonable estimate or pay cash settlement or judgment any of these development could adversely affect our financial statement in any particular period we can not assure you that our liability in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceeding will not exceed our estimate or adversely affect our financial statement and business however based on our experience current information and applicable law we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amount we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceeding in excess of our reserve of december will have material effect on our financial statement if we do not or can not adequately protect our intellectual property or if third party infringe our intellectual property right we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resource enforcing our right we own numerous patent trademark copyright trade secret and other intellectual property and license to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property right that we obtain however may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide significant competitive advantage and patent may not be issued for pending or future patent application owned by or licensed to in addition the step that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented designed around or becoming subject to compulsory licensing particularly in country where intellectual property right are not highly developed or protected in some circumstance enforcement may not be available to because an infringer ha dominant intellectual property position or for other business reason or country may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreement with employee consultant and other party to protect in part trade secret and other proprietary right there can be no assurance that these agreement will adequately protect our trade secret and other proprietary right and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedy for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third party will not otherwise gain access to our trade secret or other proprietary right our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property right that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property right could adversely impact our business including our competitive position and financial statement third party may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property right and we could suffer significant litigation expense loss or licensing expense or be prevented from selling product or service from time to time we receive notice from third party alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time consuming due to the complexity of many of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting counterclaim or negotiating license in response to claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition result of such claim of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our right to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical product and service be required to pay substantial damage or license fee with respect to the infringed right or be required to redesign our product at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our business including our competitive position and financial statement even if we successfully defend against claim of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant cost and diversion of management attention and resource which could adversely affect our business and financial statement government ha certain right to use and disclose some of the intellectual property that we license and could exclusively license it to third party

requirement for public use under federal regulation further the government right include the right to use and disclose without limitation technical data relating to licensed technology that wa developed in whole or in part at government expense defect and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our product or service including software or allegation thereof could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statement manufacturing or design defect or bug in unanticipated use of safety or quality issue or the perception of such issue with respect to off label use of or inadequate disclosure of risk relating to the use of product and service that we make or sell including item that we source from third party can lead to personal injury death property damage loss of profit or other liability these event could lead to recall or safety alert result in the removal of product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claim being brought against recall removal and product liability and similar claim regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome can result in significant cost well negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our product and service our business can also be affected by study of the utilization safety and efficacy of medical device product and component that are conducted by industry participant government agency and others any of the above can result in the discontinuation of marketing of such product in one or more country and may give rise to claim for damage from person who believe they have been injured result of product issue the manufacture of many of our product is highly exacting and complex process and if we directly or indirectly encounter problem manufacturing product our reputation business and financial statement could suffer the manufacture of many of our product is highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirement problem may arise during manufacturing for variety of reason including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocol and procedure problem with raw material natural disaster and environmental factor and if not discovered before the product is released to market could result in recall and product liability exposure because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facility and other stringent regulation of the fda and similar agency regarding the manufacture of certain of our product an alternative manufacturer may not be available on timely basis to replace such production capacity any of these manufacturing problem could result in significant cost liability and lost revenue well negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our product our indebtedness may limit our operation and our use of our cash flow and any failure to comply with the covenant that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statement of december we had approximately billion in outstanding indebtedness in addition of december we had the ability to incur an additional billion of indebtedness in direct borrowing or under the outstanding commercial paper facility based on the amount available under the company billion credit facility which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balance our debt level and related debt service obligation can have negative consequence including requiring to dedicate significant cash flow from operation to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the fund we have available for other purpose such acquisition and capital investment reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to change in our business and market condition and exposing to interest rate risk since portion of our debt obligation are at variable rate we may incur significantly more debt in the future particularly to finance acquisition and there can be no assurance that our cost of funding will not substantially increase our current revolving credit facility and long term debt obligation also impose certain restriction on for more information refer to md if we breach any of these restriction and do not obtain waiver from the lender subject to applicable cure period the outstanding indebtedness and any other indebtedness with cross default provision could be declared immediately due and payable which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial statement in addition any failure to maintain the credit rating assigned to by independent rating agency would adversely affect our cost of fund and could adversely affect our liquidity and access to the capital market if we add new debt the risk described above could increase change in our relationship with or the financial condition performance purchasing pattern or inventory level of key distributor and other channel partner could adversely affect our financial statement certain of our business sell significant amount of their product to or through key distributor and other channel partner that have valuable relationship with customer and end user some of these distributor and other partner also sell our competitor product or compete with directly and if they favor competing product for any reason they may fail to market our product effectively adverse change in our relationship with these distributor and other partner reduction or discontinuation of their purchase from or adverse development in their financial condition performance or purchasing pattern could adversely affect our business and financial statement the level of inventory maintained by our distributor and other channel partner and change in those level can also significantly impact our result of operation in any given period in addition the consolidation of distributor and customer in certain of our served industry could adversely impact our business and financial statement certain of our business rely on relationship with collaborative partner and other third party for development supply and marketing of certain product and potential product and such collaborative partner or other third party could fail to perform sufficiently we believe that for certain of our business success in penetrating target market depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationship with other company relying on collaborative relationship is risky because among other thing our collaborative partner may not devote sufficient resource to the success of our collaboration fail to obtain regulatory approval necessary to continue the collaboration in timely manner be acquired by other company and terminate our collaborative partnership or become insolvent compete with disagree with on key detail of the collaborative relationship have insufficient capital resource and decline to renew existing collaboration on acceptable term because these and other factor may be beyond our control the development or commercialization of our product involved in collaborative partnership may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected if we or any of our collaborative partner terminate collaborative arrangement we may be required to devote additional resource to product development and commercialization or we may need to cancel some development program which could adversely affect our business and financial statement our financial result are subject to fluctuation in the cost and availability of commodity that we use in our operation discussed in item business material our manufacturing and other operation employ wide variety of component raw material and other commodity price for and availability of these component raw material and other commodity have fluctuated significantly in the past any sustained interruption in the supply of these item could adversely affect our business in addition due to the highly competitive nature of the industry that we serve the cost containment effort of our customer and the term of certain contract we are party to if commodity price rise we may be unable to pas along cost increase through higher price if we are unable to fully recover higher commodity cost through price increase or offset these increase through cost reduction or if there is time delay between the increase in cost and our ability to recover or offset these cost our margin and profitability could decline and our financial statement could be adversely affected if we can not adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchase required for our manufacturing activity to reflect change in market condition and customer demand our profitability may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole or limited source of supply for certain material component and service could cause production interruption delay and inefficiency we purchase material component and equipment from third party for use in our manufacturing operation our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchase to reflect change in customer demand and market fluctuation including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during market upturn supplier may extend lead time limit supply or increase price if we can not purchase sufficient product at competitive price and quality and on timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipment may be delayed our cost may increase or we may breach our contractual commitment and incur liability conversely in order to secure supply for the production of product we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitment with vendor which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demand if demand for our product is le than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventory and be forced to incur additional charge and our profitability may suffer in addition some of our business purchase certain requirement from sole or limited source supplier for reason of quality assurance regulatory requirement cost effectiveness availability or uniqueness of design if these or other supplier encounter financial operating or other difficulty or if our relationship with them change we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement source of supply the supply chain for our business could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraint bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reason decreased availability of key raw material or and external event such natural disaster pandemic health issue war terrorist action governmental action and legislative or regulatory change any of these factor could result in production interruption delay extended lead time and inefficiency because we can not always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structure to changing market condition our manufacturing capacity may at time exceed or fall short of our production requirement any or all of these problem could result in the loss of customer provide an opportunity for competing product to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our financial statement change in governmental regulation may reduce demand for our product or service or increase our expense we compete in market in which we and our customer must comply with supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional regulation such regulation governing health and safety the environment food and drug privacy and electronic communication we develop configure and market our product and service to meet customer need created by these regulation these regulation are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdiction any significant change in any of these regulation or in the interpretation or application thereof could reduce demand for increase our cost of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified product and service or could restrict our existing activity product and service for example number of our product and service are marketed to the pharmaceutical and related industry for use in discovering and developing drug and therapy change in the fda regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these product and service in addition in certain of our market our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulation in these market the delay or failure of governmental and other entity to adopt or enforce new regulation the adoption of new regulation which our product and service are not positioned to address or the repeal of existing regulation could adversely affect demand in addition regulatory deadline may result in substantially different level of demand for our product and service from period to period work stoppage union and work council campaign and other labor dispute could adversely impact our productivity and result of operation we have number of collective bargaining unit and various non collective labor arrangement we are subject to potential work stoppage union and work council campaign and other labor dispute any of which could adversely impact our financial statement and business including our productivity and reputation international economic political legal compliance and business factor could negatively affect our financial statement in approximately of our sale were derived from customer outside the united state in addition many of our manufacturing operation supplier and employee are located outside the united state since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate market outside the united state and increase the localization of our product and service we expect to continue to increase our sale and presence outside the united state particularly in the high growth market our international business and particularly our business in high growth market is subject to risk that are customarily encountered in non operation including interruption in the transportation of material to and finished good to our customer difference in term of sale including payment term local product preference and product requirement change in country or region political or economic condition such the devaluation of particular currency trade protection measure embargo and import or export restriction and requirement unexpected change in law or regulatory requirement including change in tax law capital control and limitation on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash the potential for nationalization of enterprise change in medical reimbursement policy and program limitation on legal right and our ability to enforce such right difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operation differing labor regulation difficulty in implementing restructuring action on timely or comprehensive basis and differing protection of intellectual property any of these risk could negatively affect our financial statement and business including our growth rate significant development stemming from the current administration or the united kingdom referendum on membership in the eu could have an adverse effect on change potential change or uncertainty in social political regulatory and economic condition or law and policy governing the health care system and drug price foreign trade manufacturing and development and investment in the territory and country where we or our customer operate stemming from the current administration could adversely affect our business and financial statement for example the current administration ha called for substantial change to trade agreement such the north american free trade agreement nafta ha increased tariff on certain good imported into the united state and ha raised the possibility of imposing significant additional tariff increase additionally on june the united kingdom held referendum and voted in favor of leaving the eu this referendum ha caused and may continue to cause political and economic uncertainty including significant volatility in global stock market and currency exchange rate fluctuation although it is unknown what the full term of the united kingdom future relationship with the eu will be it is possible that there will be greater restriction on import and export between the united kingdom and other country including the united state and increased regulatory complexity any of these factor could adversely affect customer demand our relationship with customer and supplier and our business and financial statement if we suffer loss to our facility supply chain distribution system or information technology system due to catastrophe or other event our operation could be seriously harmed our facility supply chain distribution system and information technology system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood earthquake hurricane public health crisis war terrorism or other natural or man made disaster if any of these facility supply chain or system were to experience catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operation delay production and shipment result in defective product or service damage customer relationship and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expense the third party insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decision regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect against such loss our defined benefit pension plan are subject to financial market risk that could adversely affect our financial statement the performance of the financial market and interest rate impact our defined benefit pension plan expense and funding obligation significant change in market interest rate decrease in the fair value of plan asset investment loss on plan asset and change in discount rate may increase our funding obligation and adversely impact our financial statement in addition upward pressure on the cost of providing health care coverage to current employee and retiree may increase our future funding obligation and adversely affect our financial statement item unresolved staff commentsnot applicable item propertiesdanaher corporate headquarters are located in washington in facility that the company lease of

to the consolidated financial statement for information regarding legal proceeding and contingency and for discussion of risk related to legal proceeding and contingency refer to item risk factor critical accounting estimatesmanagement discussion and analysis of the company financial condition and result of operation is based upon the company consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state the preparation of these financial statement requires management to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent asset and liability the company base these estimate and judgment on historical experience the current economic environment and on various other assumption that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance actual result may differ materially from these estimate and judgment the company belief the following accounting estimate are most critical to an understanding of it financial statement estimate are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criterion the estimate requires assumption about material matter that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and material change in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to period for detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimate refer to note to the consolidated financial statement acquired intangible the company business acquisition typically result in the recognition of goodwill in process and other intangible asset which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charge that the company may incur refer to note and to the consolidated financial statement for description of the company policy relating to goodwill acquired intangible and acquisition in performing it goodwill impairment testing the company estimate the fair value of it reporting unit primarily using market based approach in evaluating the estimate derived by the market based approach management make judgment about the relevance and reliability of the multiple by considering factor unique to it reporting unit including operating result business plan economic projection anticipated future cash flow and transaction and marketplace data well judgment about the comparability of the market proxy selected in certain circumstance the company also estimate fair value utilizing discounted cash flow analysis an income approach in order to validate the result of the market approach the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumption about projected revenue growth future operating margin discount rate and terminal value there are inherent uncertainty related to these assumption and management judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment of december the company had eight reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing reporting unit resulting from recent acquisition generally present the highest risk of impairment management belief the impairment risk associated with these reporting unit decrease these business are integrated into the company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth the company annual goodwill impairment analysis in indicated that in all instance the fair value of the company reporting unit exceeded their carrying value and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company reporting unit of the annual testing date ranged from approximately to approximately in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculation used in the goodwill impairment test the company applied hypothetical decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical value to the reporting unit carrying value based on this hypothetical decrease the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company reporting unit ranged from approximately to approximately the company review identified intangible asset for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable the company also test intangible asset with indefinite life at least annually for impairment determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flow expected to be generated by the asset these analysis require management to make judgment and estimate about future revenue expense market condition and discount rate related to these asset if actual result are not consistent with management estimate and assumption goodwill and other intangible asset may be overstated and charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the company consolidated financial statement historically the company estimate of goodwill and intangible asset have been materially correct of contentscontingent liability discussed in item legal proceeding and note to the consolidated financial statement the company is from time to time subject to variety of litigation and similar contingent liability incidental to it business or the business operation of previously owned entity the company recognizes liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessment require judgment concerning matter such litigation development and outcome the anticipated outcome of negotiation the number of future claim and the cost of both pending and future claim in addition because most contingency are resolved over long period of time liability may change in the future due to various factor including those discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement if the reserve established by the company with respect to these contingent liability are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserve which would adversely affect the company financial statement revenue recognition the company derives revenue from the sale of product and service refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for description of the company revenue recognition policy although most of the company sale agreement contain standard term and condition certain agreement contain multiple element or nonstandard term and condition result judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverable specified in these agreement should be treated separate unit of accounting for revenue recognition purpose and if so how the consideration should be allocated among the element and when to recognize revenue for each element the company allocates revenue to each element in the contractual arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy that in some instance may require the company to estimate the selling price of certain deliverable that are not sold separately or where third party evidence of pricing is not observable the company estimate of selling price impact the amount and timing of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangement the company also enters into lease arrangement with customer which requires the company to determine whether the arrangement are operating or sale type lease certain of the company lease contract are customized for larger customer and often result in complex term and condition that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criterion on january the company adopted accounting standard update asu no revenue from contract with customer topic which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance refer to new accounting standard in note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information on the company adoption of this asu if the company judgment regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect the company reported revenue in particular period may be incorrect historically the company estimate of revenue have been materially correct pension and other postretirement benefit for description of the company pension and other postretirement benefit accounting practice refer to note and to the consolidated financial statement calculation of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit cost and obligation depend on the assumption used in the actuarial valuation including assumption regarding discount rate expected return on plan asset rate of salary increase health care cost trend rate mortality rate and other factor if the assumption used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefit cost and obligation are incorrect or if the factor underlying the assumption change result of difference in actual experience change in key economic indicator or other factor the company consolidated financial statement could be materially affected basis point reduction in the discount rate used for the plan would have increased the net obligation by million million on an after tax basis and the non net obligation by million million on an after tax basis from the amount recorded in the consolidated financial statement of december basis point increase in the discount rate used for the plan would have decreased the net obligation by million million on an after tax basis and the non net obligation by million million on an after tax basis from the amount recorded in the consolidated financial statement of december for the estimated long term rate of return for the plan is and the company intends to continue to use an assumption of for the estimated long term rate of return for the non plan wa determined on plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan asset and ranged from to if the expected long term rate of return on plan asset for wa reduced by basis point pension expense for the and non plan for would have increased million million on an after tax basis and million million on an after tax basis respectively for discussion of the company and anticipated defined benefit pension plan contribution refer to liquidity and capital resource cash and cash requirement income tax for description of the company income tax accounting policy refer to note and to the consolidated financial statement the company establishes valuation allowance for it deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized this requires management to make judgment and estimate regarding the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary difference expected future taxable income and of content the impact of tax planning strategy future change to tax rate would also impact the amount of deferred tax asset and liability and could have an adverse impact on the company consolidated financial statement the company provides for unrecognized tax benefit when based upon the technical merit it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination judgment is required in evaluating tax position and determining income tax provision the company re evaluates the technical merit of it tax position and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstance including when tax audit is completed applicable tax law change including tax case ruling or legislative guidance or the applicable statute of limitation expires on december the tcja wa enacted which substantially change the tax system including lowering the

company ha reflected the provisional estimate of change from the tcja in the consolidated financial statement of december based upon the company analysis of the legislation using available information certain assumption related to the impact of the tcja will require continued monitoring and further analysis including the amount of foreign cash and undistributed earnings subject to the transition tax the amount of available credit to reduce required payment of the transition tax and the impact of estimated temporary difference between book and taxable income in or prior period under audit by the irs although the company belief that it estimate and judgment are reasonable actual result may differ materially from these estimate the company will continue to refine these estimate throughout and record any required adjustment they are determined permitted by sab no the treasury department and the irs have not yet issued regulation implementing the new tax law and these regulation could result in change to the company estimate some or all of these judgment are also subject to review by the irs if the irs were to successfully challenge the company right to realize some or all of the tax benefit the company ha recorded based on current interpretation of the law regarding certain item or if the amount of the transition tax or other tax liability are understated it could have material adverse effect on the company financial statement in addition certain of the company tax return are currently under review by tax authority including in denmark refer to result of operation

income to retained earnings for stranded tax effect resulting from the tcja reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate the asu is effective for all entity for annual period beginning after december with early adoption permitted and is to be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in the federal corporate income tax rate in the tcja is recognized management ha not yet completed it assessment of the impact of the asu on the company consolidated financial statement in may the fasb issued asu no compensation stock compensation topic scope of modification accounting which provided clarity on which change to the term or condition of share based payment award require an entity to apply the modification accounting provision required in topic the standard is effective for all entity for annual period beginning after december with early adoption permitted including adoption in any interim period for which financial statement have not yet been issued the company doe not expect the adoption of this asu will have material impact on it consolidated financial statement in march the fasb issued asu no compensation retirement benefit topic improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost which requires employer to disaggregate the service cost component from other component of net periodic benefit cost and to disclose the amount of net periodic benefit cost that are included in each income statement line item the standard requires employer to report the service cost component in the same line item other compensation cost and to report the other component of net periodic benefit cost which include interest cost expected return on plan asset amortization of prior service cost or credit and actuarial gain and loss separately and outside subtotal of operating income the income statement guidance requires application on retrospective basis the asu is effective for public entity for annual period beginning after december including interim period with early adoption permitted had this standard been adopted in prior period reported operating profit would have been million and million lower and other income would have been million and million higher than reflected in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december and respectively other than the presentation of the component of pension expense in the income statement the adoption of this asu will not have material impact on the company consolidated financial statement in june the fasb issued asu no financial instrument credit loss topic measurement of credit loss on financial instrument which amends the impairment model by requiring entity to use forward looking approach based on expected loss rather than incurred loss to estimate credit loss on certain type of financial instrument including trade receivables this may result in the earlier recognition of allowance for loss the asu is effective for public entity for fiscal year beginning after december with early adoption permitted management ha not yet completed it assessment of the impact of the new standard on the company consolidated financial statement currently the company belief that the most notable impact of this asu will relate to it process around the assessment of the adequacy of it allowance for doubtful account on trade account receivable and the recognition of credit loss in march the fasb issued asu no compensation stock compensation topic which simplifies several aspect of the accounting for share based payment transaction including the income tax consequence classification of award either equity or liability classification of certain item on the statement of cash flow and accounting for forfeiture the company adopted this standard effective january the asu requires that the difference between the actual tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting applicable and the tax benefit recorded based on the fair value of the stock award at the time of grant the excess tax benefit be reflected reduction of the current period provision for of contentsincome tax with any shortfall recorded an increase in the tax provision rather than component of change to additional paid in capital the asu also requires the excess tax benefit realized be reflected operating cash flow rather than financing cash flow for the year ended december the provision for income tax from continuing operation wa reduced and operating cash flow from continuing operation wa increased by million reflecting the impact of adopting this standard had this asu been adopted at january the provision for income tax from continuing operation would have been reduced and operating cash flow from continuing operation would have been increased by million from the amount reported for the year ended december the actual benefit to be realized in future period is inherently uncertain and will vary based on the price of the company common stock well the timing of and relative value realized for future share based transaction in february the fasb issued asu no lease topic which requires lessee to recognize right of use asset and lease liability for all lease with term greater than month the standard also requires disclosure by lessee and lessor about the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flow arising from lease the accounting applied by lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under the current standard the standard must be adopted using modified retrospective transition approach and provides for certain practical expedient the asu is effective for public entity for fiscal year beginning after december with early adoption permitted in september and january the fasb issued asu no revenue recognition topic revenue from contract with customer topic lease topic and lease topic and asu no lease topic land easement practical expedient for transition to topic which provided additional implementation guidance on the previously issued asu management ha not yet completed it assessment of the impact of the new standard on the company consolidated financial statement the company is in the early stage of implementation and currently belief that the most notable impact to it financial statement upon the adoption of this asu will be the recognition of material right of use asset and lease liability for it real estate and equipment lease in january the fasb issued asu no recognition and measurement of financial asset and financial liability the asu amends guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instrument including significant revision in accounting related to the classification and measurement of investment in equity security and presentation of certain fair value change for financial liability when the fair value option is elected the asu requires equity security to be measured at fair value with change in fair value recognized through net earnings and amends certain disclosure requirement associated with the fair value of financial instrument in the period of adoption the company is required to reclassify the unrealized gain loss on equity security within accumulated other comprehensive income loss to retained earnings the asu is effective for the company on january and the adoption will not have material effect on the company consolidated financial statement in may the fasb issued asu no revenue from contract with customer topic which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance the core principle of the asu is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised good or service to customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those good or service in july the fasb deferred the effective date of the standard by one year which result in the new standard being effective for the company at the beginning of it first quarter of fiscal year in addition during march april may and december and september and november the fasb issued asu no revenue from contract with customer topic principal versus agent consideration reporting revenue gross versus net asu no revenue from contract with customer topic identifying performance obligation and licensing asu no revenue from contract with customer topic narrow scope improvement and practical expedient asu no technical correction and improvement to topic revenue from contract with customer asu no revenue recognition topic revenue from contract with customer topic lease topic and lease topic and asu no income statement reporting comprehensive income topic revenue recognition topic and revenue from contract with customer topic respectively which clarified the guidance on certain item such reporting revenue principal versus agent identifying performance obligation accounting for intellectual property license assessing collectability presentation of sale tax impairment testing for contract cost disclosure of performance obligation and provided additional implementation guidance on january the company will adopt the asu using the modified retrospective method for all contract the cumulative impact to beginning retained earnings from adopting the new revenue standard is expected to be charge of le than million the impact to beginning retained earnings is primarily driven by the deferral of revenue for unfulfilled performance obligation partially offset by the capitalization of certain cost to obtain contract primarily sale related commission where the amortization period for the related asset is greater than one year the company expects the impact of the new standard on the amount and timing of revenue recognized in to be insignificant the asu also requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flow from customer contract including judgment and change in judgment and asset recognized from cost incurred to obtain or fulfill contract the company is in the process of finalizing change to it business process system and control to support recognition and disclosure under the new revenue standard of contentsnote acquisitionsthe company continually evaluates potential acquisition that either strategically fit with the company existing

approximates the option expected term expected volatility is based on implied volatility from traded option on the company stock and historical volatility of the company stock the dividend yield is calculated by dividing the company annual dividend based on the most recent quarterly dividend rate by the closing stock price on the grant date to estimate the option exercise timing used in the
