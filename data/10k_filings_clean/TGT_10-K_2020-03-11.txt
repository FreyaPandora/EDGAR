of sale the vast majority of our inventory is accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method using the last in first out method lifo our inventory is valued at the lower of lifo cost or market we reduce inventory for estimated loss related to shrink and markdowns our shrink estimate is based on historical loss verified by physical inventory count historically our actual physical inventory count result have shown our estimate to be reliable market adjustment for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise ha diminished we believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turn in le than three month inventory wa million and million of february and february respectively and is further described in note to the financial statement vendor income we receive various form of consideration from our vendor vendor income principally earned result of volume rebate markdown allowance promotion and advertising allowance substantially all vendor income is recorded reduction of cost of sale we establish receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on historical trending and data this receivable is computed by forecasting vendor income collection and estimating the amount earned the majority of the year end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter

would have impacted our self insurance expense by million in historically adjustment to our estimate have not been material refer to part ii item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market

eligibility and the level of benefit varies depending on team member full time or part time status date of hire age and or length of service the benefit obligation and related expense for these plan are determined based on actuarial calculation using assumption about the expected long term rate of return the discount rate compensation growth rate mortality and retirement age these assumption with adjustment made for any significant plan or participant change are used to determine the period end benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year our expected long term rate of return on plan asset of percent wa determined by the portfolio composition historical long term investment performance and current market condition percentage point decrease in our expected long term rate of return would increase annual expense by million the discount rate used to determine benefit obligation is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bond using yield for maturity that are in line with the duration of our pension liability our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with change in interest rate percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million based on our experience we use graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger shorter service pension eligible team member than it doe for older longer service pension eligible team member pension benefit are further described in note to the financial statement legal and other contingency we believe the accrual recorded in our consolidated financial statement properly reflect loss exposure that are both probable and reasonably estimable we do not believe any of the

risk factor to this form which should be read in conjunction with the forward looking statement in this report forward looking statement speak only of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskas of february our exposure to market risk wa primarily from interest rate change on our debt obligation some of which are at london interbank offered rate libor our interest rate exposure is primarily due to difference between our floating rate debt obligation compared to our floating rate short term investment of february our floating rate short term investment exceeded our floating rate debt by approximately million based on our balance sheet position of february the annualized effect of percentage point increase in floating interest rate on our floating rate debt obligation net of our floating rate short term investment would not be significant in general we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short term investment over time but that may vary in different interest rate environment see further description of our debt and derivative instrument in note and to the financial statement in the united kingdom financial conduct authority announced the intent to phase out libor by the end of result we may amend our contract that use libor benchmark but do not expect these change will have material impact on our financial statement liquidity and access to capital market we record our general liability and worker compensation liability at net present value therefore these liability fluctuate with change in interest rate based on our balance sheet position of february the annualized effect of percentage point decrease in interest rate would be to decrease earnings before income tax by million in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuation on our qualified defined benefit pension plan the value of our pension liability is inversely related to change in interest rate percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million to protect decline in interest rate we hold high quality long duration bond and interest rate swap in our pension plan trust at year end we had hedged percent of the interest rate exposure of our plan liability more fully described in note to the financial statement we are exposed to market return on accumulated team member balance in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan we control the risk of offering the
