residential and general service customer within the electric utility and infrastructure service territory is expected to increase over time economic condition within the service territory continue to improve sale growth ha been hampered by continued adoption of energy efficiency and self generation the continued adoption of more efficient housing and appliance is expected to have negative impact on average usage per residential customer over time while residential sale increased in compared to the growth rate wa modest when compared to historical period seasonality and the impact of weatherrevenues and cost are influenced by seasonal weather pattern peak sale of electricity occur during the summer and winter month which result in higher revenue and cash flow during these period by contrast lower sale of electricity occur during the spring and fall allowing for scheduled plant maintenance residential and general service customer are more impacted by weather than industrial customer estimated weather impact are based on actual current period weather compared to normal weather condition normal weather condition are defined the long term average of actual historical weather condition the estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the temperature variance from normal condition and customer historic usage pattern the methodology used to estimate the impact of weather not consider all variable that may impact customer response to weather condition such humidity in the summer or wind chill in the winter the precision of this estimate may also be impacted by applying long term weather trend to shorter term period heating degree day measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature fall below base temperature cooling degree day measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature rise the base temperature each degree of temperature below the base temperature count one heating degree

within their service territory with the exception of ohio which ha competitive electricity supply market for generation service electric utility and infrastructure owns and operates facility necessary to transmit and distribute electricity and except in ohio to generate electricity service are priced by state commission approved rate designed to include the cost of providing these service and reasonable return on invested capital this regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable electricity at fair price competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the development and deployment of alternative energy source including on site generation from industrial customer and distributed generation such private solar at residential general service and or industrial customer site duke energy is not aware of any proposed legislation within any of it jurisdiction that would provide retail customer the right to choose their electricity provider or otherwise restructure or deregulate the electric industry including broadly subsidizing distributed generation such private solar although there is no pending legislation at this time if the retail jurisdiction served by electric utility and infrastructure become subject to deregulation the recovery of stranded cost could become significant consideration stranded cost primarily include the generation asset of electric utility and infrastructure whose value in competitive marketplace may be le than their current book value well above market purchased power commitment from qualifying facility qfs the public utility regulatory policy act of purpa established new class of generating facility qfs typically small power production facility that generate power within utility company service territory for which the utility company are legally obligated to purchase the energy at an avoided cost rate thus far all state that have passed restructuring legislation have provided for the opportunity to recover substantial portion of stranded cost electric utility and infrastructure largest stranded cost exposure is primarily related to duke energy florida purchased power commitment with qfs which it ha future minimum expected capacity payment through of billion duke energy florida wa obligated to enter into these contract under provision of purpa duke energy florida continues to seek way to address the impact of escalating payment under these contract however the fpsc allows full recovery of the retail portion of the cost of power purchased from qfs for additional information related to these purchased power commitment see note to the consolidated financial statement commitment and contingency in ohio electric utility and infrastructure conduct competitive auction for electricity supply the cost of energy purchased through these auction is recovered from retail customer electric utility earns retail margin in ohio on the transmission and distribution of electricity and not on the cost of the underlying energy wholesaleduke energy competes with other utility and merchant generator for bulk power sale sale to municipality and cooperative and wholesale transaction under primarily cost based contract approved by ferc the principal factor in competing for these sale are price availability of capacity and power and reliability of service price are influenced primarily by market condition and fuel cost increased competition in the wholesale electric utility industry and the availability of transmission access could affect electric utility and infrastructure load forecast plan for power supply and wholesale energy sale and related revenue wholesale energy sale will be impacted by the extent to which additional generation is available to sell to the wholesale market and the ability of electric utility and infrastructure to attract new customer and to retain existing customer energy capacity and resourceselectric utility and infrastructure owns approximately megawatt mw of generation capacity for additional information on owned generation facility see item property energy and capacity are also supplied through contract with other generator and purchased on the open market factor that could cause electric utility and infrastructure to purchase power for it customer include generating plant outage extreme weather condition generation reliability demand growth and price electric utility and infrastructure ha interconnection and arrangement with it neighboring utility to facilitate planning emergency assistance sale and purchase of capacity and energy and reliability of power supply electric utility and infrastructure generation portfolio is balanced mix of energy resource different operating characteristic

requisite emission control equipment to meet united state environmental protection agency epa regulation recently approved or proposed duke energy continues to evaluate the potential need to retire these coal fired generating facility earlier than the current estimated useful life and plan to seek regulatory recovery for amount that would not be otherwise recovered when any of these asset are retired for additional information related to potential plant retirement see note to the consolidated financial statement regulatory matter ion october the epa published in the federal register the final clean power plan cpp rule that regulates carbon dioxide emission from existing fossil fuel fired electric generating unit egus the cpp establishes emission rate and mass cap goal that apply to existing fossil fuel fired egus petition challenging the rule have been filed by several group on february the supreme court issued stay of the final cpp rule halting implementation of the cpp legal challenge are resolved state in which the duke energy registrant operate have suspended work on cpp compliance plan result of the stay oral argument of the judge on circuit court heard on september the court is expected to decide the case in early compliance with cpp could cause the industry to replace coal fired generation with natural gas and renewables cost to operate coal fired generation plant continue to grow due to increasing environmental compliance requirement including ash management cost unrelated to cpp which may result in the retirement of coal fired generation plant earlier than the current end of useful life if the cpp is ultimately upheld by the court and implementation go forward the duke energy registrant could incur increased fuel purchased power operation and maintenance and other cost for replacement generation result of this rule due to the uncertainty related to the implementation of the cpp the duke energy registrant can not predict the outcome of

energy significant competitive factor is price gas utility and infrastructure primary product competition is with electricity for heating water heating and cooking increase in the price of natural gas or decrease in the price of other energy source could negatively impact competitive position by decreasing the price benefit of natural gas to the consumer in the case of industrial customer such manufacturing plant adverse economic or market condition including higher gas cost could cause these customer to suspend business operation or to use alternative source of energy in favor of energy source with lower per unit cost higher gas cost or decrease in the price of other energy source may allow competition from alternative energy source for application that have traditionally used natural gas encouraging customer to move away from natural gas fired equipment to equipment fueled by other energy source competition between natural gas and other form of energy is also based on efficiency performance reliability safety and other non price factor technological improvement in other energy source and event that impair the public perception of the non price attribute of natural gas could erode our competitive advantage these factor in turn could decrease the demand for natural gas impair our ability to attract new customer and cause existing customer to switch to other form

margin stabilizing mechanism that for example allow for recovery of margin loss associated with negotiated transaction designed to retain large volume customer that could use alternative fuel or that may otherwise directly access natural gas supply through their own connection to an interstate pipeline if regulator decided to discontinue the duke energy registrant use of tariff mechanism it would negatively impact result of operation financial condition and cash flow in addition regulatory authority also review whether natural gas cost are prudent and can disallow the recovery of portion of natural gas cost that the duke energy registrant seek to recover from customer which would adversely impact earnings the electric rate that the duke energy registrant regulated utility business are allowed to charge are established by state utility commission in rate case proceeding which may limit their ability to recover cost and earn an appropriate return on investment the rate that the duke energy registrant regulated utility business are allowed to charge significantly influence the result of operation financial position and liquidity of the duke energy registrant the regulation of the rate that the regulated utility business charge customer is determined in large part by state utility commission in rate case proceeding negative decision made by these regulator could have material adverse effect on the duke energy registrant result of operation financial position or liquidity and affect the ability of the duke energy registrant to recover cost and an appropriate return on the significant infrastructure investment being made duke energy can not predict the outcome of these rate case proceeding deregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition and unrecovered cost that could adversely affect the duke energy registrant financial position result of operation or cash flow and their utility business increased competition resulting from deregulation or restructuring legislation could have significant adverse impact on the duke energy registrant result of operation financial position or cash flow retail competition and the unbundling of regulated electric service could have significant adverse financial impact on the duke energy registrant due to an impairment of asset loss of retail customer lower profit margin or increased cost of capital the duke energy registrant can not predict the extent and timing of entry by additional competitor into the electric market the duke energy registrant can not predict if or when they will be subject to change in legislation or regulation nor can they predict the impact of these change on their financial position result of operation or cash flow the duke energy registrant business are subject to extensive federal regulation and wide variety of law and governmental policy including tax that may change over time in way that affect operation and cost duke energy is subject to regulation under wide variety of federal and state regulation and policy there can be no assurance that law regulation and policy will not be changed in way that result in material modification of business model and objective or affect return on investment by restricting activity and product subjecting to escalating cost or prohibiting them outright in particular substantial revision to the tax code such change to the corporate tax rate or material change in the deductibility of interest could significantly change duke energy effective tax rate the cost of capital and have an impact on result of operation and cash flow the duke energy registrant are subject to regulation by ferc nrc epa and various other federal agency well the north american electric reliability corporation regulation affect almost every aspect of the duke energy registrant business including among other thing their ability to take fundamental business management action determine the term and rate of transmission and distribution service make acquisition issue equity or debt security engage in transaction with other subsidiary and affiliate and pay dividend upstream to the duke energy registrant change to federal regulation are continuous and ongoing the duke energy registrant can not predict the future course of regulatory change or the ultimate effect those change will have on their business however change in regulation can cause delay in or affect business planning and transaction and can substantially increase the duke energy registrant cost ithe duke energy registrant are subject to numerous environmental law and regulation requiring significant capital expenditure that can increase the cost of operation and which may impact or limit business plan or cause exposure to environmental liability the duke energy registrant are subject to numerous environmental law and regulation affecting many aspect of their present and future operation including ccrs air emission water quality wastewater discharge solid waste and hazardous waste these law and regulation can result in increased capital operating and other cost these law and regulation generally require the duke energy registrant to obtain and comply with wide variety of environmental license permit inspection and other approval compliance with environmental law and regulation can require significant expenditure including expenditure for cleanup cost and damage arising from contaminated property failure to comply with environmental regulation may result in the imposition of fine penalty and injunctive measure affecting operating asset the step the duke energy registrant could be required to take to ensure their facility are in compliance could be prohibitively expensive result the duke energy registrant may be required to shut down or alter the operation of their facility which may cause the duke energy registrant to incur loss further the duke energy registrant may not be successful in recovering capital and operating cost incurred to comply with new environmental regulation through existing regulatory rate structure and their contract with customer also the duke energy registrant may not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approval for their operating asset or development project delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval failure to obtain and comply with them or change in environmental law or regulation to more stringent compliance level could result in additional cost of operation for existing facility or development of new facility being prevented delayed or subject to additional cost although it is not expected that the cost to comply with current environmental regulation will have material adverse effect on the duke energy registrant financial position result of operation or cash flow due to regulatory cost recovery the duke energy registrant are at risk that the cost of complying with environmental regulation in the future will have such an effect the epa ha recently enacted or proposed new federal regulation governing the management of cooling water intake structure wastewater and emission these regulation may require the duke energy registrant to make additional capital expenditure and increase operating and maintenance cost the duke energy registrant operation capital expenditure and financial result may be affected by regulatory change related to the impact of global climate change there is continued concern both nationally and internationally about climate change although there is no federal climate change legislation in the united state signed the paris agreement on climate change by which the signatory agreed to pursue effort to limit the increase in the global average temperature by le than degree celsius above pre industrial level if the united state honor the paris accord the epa may adopt and implement regulation to further restrict emission of ghgs increased regulation of ghg emission could impose significant additional cost on the duke energy registrant operation their supplier and customer regulatory change could also result in generation facility to be retired early and result in stranded cost if duke energy is not able to fully recover the cost and investment in generation at this time the effect that climate change regulation may have in the future on duke energy business financial condition or result of operation is not able to be predicted operational risksthe duke energy registrant result of operation may be negatively affected by overall market economic and other condition that are beyond their control sustained downturn or sluggishness in the economy generally affect the market in which the duke energy registrant operate and negatively influence operation decline in demand for electricity or natural gas result of economic downturn in the duke energy registrant regulated service territory will reduce overall sale and lessen cash flow especially industrial customer reduce production and therefore consumption of electricity and the use of natural gas although the duke energy registrant regulated electric and natural gas business are subject to regulated allowable rate of return and recovery of certain cost such fuel and purchased gas cost under periodic adjustment clause overall decline in electricity or natural gas sold result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenue and cash flow thereby diminishing result of operation additionally prolonged economic downturn that negatively impact the duke energy registrant result of operation and cash flow could result in future material impairment charge to write down the carrying value of certain asset including goodwill to their respective fair value the duke energy registrant also sell electricity into the spot market or other competitive power market on contractual basis with respect to such transaction the duke energy registrant are not guaranteed any rate of return on their capital investment through mandated rate and revenue and result of operation are likely to depend in large part upon prevailing market price these market price may fluctuate substantially over relatively short period of time and could reduce the duke energy registrant revenue and margin thereby diminishing result of operation factor that could impact sale volume generation of electricity and market price at which the duke energy registrant are able to sell electricity and natural gas are follows weather condition including abnormally mild winter or summer weather that cause lower energy or natural gas usage for heating or cooling purpose applicable and period of low rainfall that decrease the ability to operate facility in an economical manner supply of and demand for energy commodity transmission or transportation constraint or inefficiency that impact nonregulated energy operation availability of competitively priced alternative energy source which are preferred by some customer over electricity produced from coal nuclear or natural gas plant and customer usage of energy efficient equipment that reduces energy demand natural gas crude oil and refined product production level and price ability to procure satisfactory level of inventory such coal natural gas and uranium and capacity and transmission service into or of the duke energy registrant market duke energy acquisition of piedmont may not achieve it intended result duke energy and piedmont completed the merger agreement with the expectation that the transaction will result in various benefit including among other thing being accretive to earnings and foundational to establishing broader natural gas infrastructure business within duke energy achieving the anticipated benefit of the transaction is subject to number of uncertainty including whether the business of piedmont is integrated in an efficient and effective manner failure to achieve these anticipated benefit could result in increased cost decrease in the amount of expected revenue generated by the combined company and diversion of management time and energy all of which could have an adverse effect on the combined company financial position result of operation or cash flow natural disaster or operational accident may adversely affect the duke energy registrant operating result natural disaster such electromagnetic event or the earthquake and tsunami in japan or other operational accident within the company or industry such the san bruno california natural gas transmission pipeline failure could have direct significant impact on the duke energy registrant well on key contractor and supplier such event could indirectly impact the duke energy registrant through change to policy law and regulation whose compliance cost have significant impact on the duke energy registrant financial position result of operation and cash flow the reputation and financial condition of the duke energy registrant could be negatively impacted due to their obligation to comply with federal and state regulation law and other legal requirement that govern the operation assessment storage closure remediation disposal and monitoring relating to ccr the high cost and new rate impact associated with implementing these new ccr related requirement and the strategy and method necessary to implement these requirement in compliance with these legal obligation result of electricity produced for decade at coal fired power plant the duke energy registrant manage large amount of ccr that are primarily stored in dry storage within landfill or combined with water in other surface impoundment all in compliance with applicable regulatory requirement however the potential exists for another ccr related incident such the one that occurred during the dan river steam station ash basin release that could raise environmental or general public health concern such ccr related incident could have material adverse impact on the reputation and financial condition of the duke energy registrant during epa regulation were enacted related to the management of ccr from power plant these regulation classify ccr nonhazardous waste under the rcra and apply to electric generating site with new and existing landfill new and existing surface impoundment structural fill and ccr pile and establishes requirement regarding landfill design structural integrity design and assessment criterion for surface impoundment groundwater monitoring protection and remedial procedure and other operational and reporting procedure for the disposal and management of ccr in addition to the federal regulation ccr landfill and surface impoundment will continue to be independently regulated by existing state law regulation and permit well additional legal requirement that may be imposed in the future these federal and state law regulation and other legal requirement may require or result in additional expenditure increased operating and maintenance cost and or result in closure of certain power generating facility which could affect the financial position result of operation and cash flow of the duke energy registrant the duke energy registrant intend to seek full cost recovery for expenditure through the normal ratemaking process with state and federal utility commission who permit recovery in rate of necessary and prudently incurred cost associated with the duke energy registrant regulated operation and through other wholesale contract with term that contemplate recovery of such cost although there is no guarantee of full cost recovery in addition the timing for recovery of such cost could have material adverse impact on duke energy cash flow the duke energy registrant have recognized significant asset retirement obligation related to these ccr related requirement closure activity began in at the four site specified high priority by the coal ash act and at the lee steam station site in south carolina in connection with other legal requirement excavation at these site involves movement of large amount of ccr material to off site location for use structural fill to appropriate engineered off site or onsite lined landfill or conversion of the ash for beneficial use at other site preliminary planning and closure method have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management cost the coal ash act requires ccr surface impoundment in north carolina to be closed with the closure method based on risk ranking classification determined by state regulator the closure and ccr management work progress and final closure plan and corrective action measure are developed and approved at each site the scope and complexity of work and the amount of ccr material could be greater than estimate and could therefore materially increase compliance expenditure and rate impact the duke energy registrant financial position result of operation and cash flow may be negatively affected by lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customer or decline in customer demand or number of customer growth in customer account and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and natural gas and the need for additional power generation and delivery facility customer growth and customer usage are affected by number of factor outside the control of the duke energy registrant such mandated energy efficiency measure demand side management goal distributed generation resource and economic and demographic condition such population change job and income growth housing start new business formation and the overall level of economic activity certain regulatory and legislative body have introduced or are considering requirement and or incentive to reduce energy consumption by certain date additionally technological advance driven by federal law mandating new level of energy efficiency in end use electric device or other improvement in or application of technology could lead to decline in per caput energy consumption advance in distributed generation technology that produce power including fuel cell micro turbine wind turbine and solar cell may reduce the cost of alternative method of producing power to level competitive with central power station electric production utilized by the duke energy registrant isome or all of these factor could result in lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customer and may cause the failure of the duke energy registrant to fully realize anticipated benefit from significant capital investment and expenditure which could have material adverse effect on their financial position result of operation and cash flow furthermore the duke energy registrant currently have energy efficiency rider in place to recover the cost of energy efficiency program in north carolina south carolina florida ohio and kentucky should the duke energy registrant be required to invest in conservation measure that result in reduced sale from effective conservation regulatory lag in adjusting rate for the impact of these measure could have negative financial impact the duke energy registrant operating result may fluctuate on seasonal and quarterly basis and can be negatively affected by change in weather condition and severe weather including extreme weather condition associated with climate change electric power generation and natural gas distribution are generally seasonal business in most part of the the demand for power peak during the warmer summer month with market price also typically peaking at that time in other area demand for power peak during the winter demand for natural gas peak during the winter month further extreme weather condition such heat wave winter storm and severe weather associated with climate change could cause these seasonal fluctuation to be more pronounced result the overall operating result of the duke energy registrant business may fluctuate substantially on seasonal and quarterly basis and thus make period to period comparison le relevant sustained severe drought condition could impact generation by hydroelectric plant well fossil and nuclear plant operation these facility use water for cooling purpose and for the operation of environmental compliance equipment furthermore destruction caused by severe weather event such hurricane tornado severe thunderstorm snow and ice storm can result in lost operating revenue due to outage property damage including downed transmission and distribution line and additional and unexpected expense to mitigate storm damage the cost of storm restoration effort may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process the duke energy registrant sale may decrease if they are unable to gain adequate reliable and affordable access to transmission asset the duke energy registrant depend on transmission and distribution facility owned and operated by utility and other energy company to deliver electricity sold to the wholesale market ferc power transmission regulation require wholesale electric transmission service to be offered on an open access non discriminatory basis if transmission is disrupted or if transmission capacity is inadequate the duke energy registrant ability to sell and deliver product may be hindered the different regional power market have changing regulatory structure which could affect growth and performance in these region in addition the isos who oversee the transmission system in regional power market have imposed in the past and may impose in the future price limitation and other mechanism to address volatility in the power market these type of price limitation and other mechanism may adversely impact the profitability of the duke energy registrant wholesale power marketing business duke energy may be unable to complete necessary or desirable pipeline expansion or infrastructure development or maintenance project which may delay or prevent the duke energy registrant from serving natural gas customer or expanding the natural gas business in order to serve current or new natural gas customer or expand the service to existing customer the duke energy registrant need to maintain expand or upgrade distribution transmission and or storage infrastructure including laying new pipeline and building compressor station various factor such the inability to obtain required approval from local state and or federal regulatory and governmental body public opposition to project inability to obtain adequate financing competition for labor and material construction delay cost overrun and the inability to negotiate acceptable agreement relating to right of way construction or other material development component may prevent or delay the completion of project or increase cost result the duke energy registrant may be unable to adequately serve existing natural gas customer or support customer growth or could incur higher than anticipated cost which could have negative financial impact the availability of adequate interstate pipeline transportation capacity and natural gas supply may decrease the duke energy registrant purchase almost all of their natural gas supply from interstate source that must be transported to the applicable service territory interstate pipeline company transport the natural gas to the duke energy registrant system under firm service agreement that are designed to meet the requirement of their core market significant disruption to interstate pipeline capacity or reduction in natural gas supply due to event including but not limited to operational failure or disruption hurricane tornado flood freeze off of natural gas well terrorist or cyberattacks or other act of war or legislative or regulatory action or requirement including remediation related to integrity inspection could reduce the normal interstate supply of natural gas and thereby reduce earnings moreover if additional natural gas infrastructure including but not limited to exploration and drilling rig and platform processing and gathering system off shore pipeline interstate pipeline and storage can not be built at pace that meet demand growth opportunity could be limited and earnings negatively impacted fluctuation in commodity price or availability may adversely affect various aspect of the duke energy registrant operation well their financial condition result of operation and cash flow the duke energy registrant are exposed to the effect of market fluctuation in the price of natural gas coal fuel oil nuclear fuel electricity and other energy related commodity result of their ownership of energy related asset fuel cost are recovered primarily through cost recovery clause subject to the approval of state utility commission iadditionally the duke energy registrant are exposed to risk that counterparties will not be able to fulfill their obligation disruption in the delivery of fuel including disruption result of among other thing transportation delay weather labor relation force majeure event or environmental regulation affecting any of these fuel supplier could limit the duke energy registrant ability to operate their facility should counterparties fail to perform the duke energy registrant might be forced to replace the underlying commitment at prevailing market price possibly resulting in loss in addition to the amount if any already paid to the counterparties certain of the duke energy registrant hedge agreement may result in the receipt of or posting of derivative collateral with counterparties depending on the daily derivative position fluctuation in commodity price that lead to the return of collateral received and or the posting of collateral with counterparties negatively impact liquidity downgrade in the duke energy registrant credit rating could lead to additional collateral posting requirement the duke energy registrant continually monitor derivative position in relation to market price activity potential terrorist activity or military or other action could adversely affect the duke energy registrant business the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the and it ally may lead to increased political economic and financial market instability and volatility in price for natural gas and oil which may have material adverse effect in way the duke energy registrant can not predict at this time in addition future act of terrorism and possible reprisal consequence of action by the and it ally could be directed company operating in the information technology system transmission and distribution and generation facility such nuclear plant could be potential target of terrorist activity or harmful activity by individual or group the potential for terrorism ha subjected the duke energy registrant operation to increased risk and could have material adverse effect on their business in particular the duke energy registrant may experience increased capital and operating cost to implement increased security for their information technology system transmission and distribution and generation facility including nuclear power plant under the nrc design basis threat requirement these increased cost could include additional physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following terrorist incident cyberattacks and data security breach could adversely affect the duke energy registrant business information security risk have generally increased in recent year result of the proliferation of new technology and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks and data security breach the utility industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology system and network infrastructure which are part of an interconnected regional grid additionally connectivity to the internet continues to increase through smart grid and other initiative because of the critical nature of the infrastructure increased connectivity to the internet and technology system inherent vulnerability to disability or failure due to hacking virus act of war or terrorism or other type of data security breach the duke energy registrant face heightened risk of cyberattack in the event of such an attack the duke energy registrant could have business operation disrupted property damaged customer information stolen and other private information accessed ii experience substantial loss of revenue repair and restoration cost implementation cost for additional security measure to avert future cyberattacks and other financial loss and iii be subject to increased regulation litigation and reputational damage failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could unfavorably impact the duke energy registrant result of operation certain event such an aging workforce mismatch of skill set or complement to future need or unavailability of contract resource may lead to operating challenge and increased cost the challenge include lack of resource loss of knowledge base and the lengthy time required for skill development in this case cost including cost for contractor to replace employee productivity cost and safety cost may increase failure to hire and adequately train replacement employee including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employee or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business especially considering the workforce need associated with nuclear generation facility and new skill required to operate modernized technology enabled power grid if the duke energy registrant are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce their financial position result of operation or cash flow could be negatively affected the cost of retiring duke energy florida crystal river unit could prove to be more extensive than is currently identified cost to retire and decommission the plant could exceed estimate and if not recoverable through the regulatory process could adversely affect duke energy progress energy and duke energy florida financial condition result of operation and cash flow duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana membership in an rto present risk that could have material adverse effect on their result of operation financial condition and cash flow the rule governing the various regional power market may change which could affect duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana cost and or revenue to the degree duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana incur significant additional fee and increased cost to participate in an rto their result of operation may be impacted duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana may be allocated portion of the cost of transmission facility built by others due to change in rto transmission rate design duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana may be required to expand their transmission system according to decision made by an rto rather than their own internal planning process while rto transmission rate were initially designed to be revenue neutral various proposal and proceeding currently taking place by the ferc may cause transmission rate to change from time to time in addition rtos have been developing rule associated with the allocation and methodology of assigning cost associated with improved transmission reliability reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission right that may have financial impact on duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana member of an rto duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana are subject to certain additional risk including those associated with the allocation among rto member of loss caused by unreimbursed default of other participant in the rto market and those associated with complaint case filed against an rto that may seek refund of revenue previously earned by rto member inuclear generation risksduke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida may incur substantial cost and liability due to their ownership and operation of nuclear generating facility ownership interest in and operation of nuclear station by duke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida subject them to various risk these risk include among other thing the potential harmful effect on the environment and human health resulting from the current or past operation of nuclear facility and the storage handling and disposal of radioactive material limitation on the amount and type of insurance commercially available to cover loss that might arise in connection with nuclear operation and uncertainty with respect to the technological and financial aspect of decommissioning nuclear plant at the end of their licensed life ownership and operation of nuclear generation facility requires compliance with licensing and safety related requirement imposed by the nrc in the event of non compliance the nrc may increase regulatory oversight impose fine or shut down unit depending upon it assessment of the severity of the situation revised security and safety requirement promulgated by the nrc which could be prompted by among other thing event within or outside of the control of duke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida such serious nuclear incident at facility owned by third party could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditure well assessment to cover third party loss in addition if serious nuclear incident were to occur it could have material adverse effect on the result of operation financial condition cash flow and reputation of the duke energy registrant liquidity capital requirement and common stock risksthe duke energy registrant rely on access to short term borrowing and longer term capital market to finance their capital requirement and support their liquidity need access to those market can be adversely affected by number of condition many of which are beyond the duke energy registrant control the duke energy registrant business are significantly financed through issuance of debt the maturity and repayment profile of debt used to finance investment often doe not correlate to cash flow from their asset accordingly source of liquidity for capital requirement not satisfied by the cash flow from their operation and to fund investment originally financed through debt instrument with disparate maturity the duke energy registrant rely on access to short term money market well longer term capital market the subsidiary registrant also rely on access to short term intercompany borrowing if the duke energy registrant are not able to access capital at competitive rate or at all the ability to finance their operation and implement their strategy and business plan scheduled could be adversely affected an inability to access capital may limit the duke energy registrant ability to pursue improvement or acquisition that they may otherwise rely on for future growth market disruption may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial market such disruption could include economic downturn the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company unfavorable capital market condition market price for electricity and gas actual or threatened terrorist attack or the overall health of the energy industry the availability of credit under duke energy master credit facility depends upon the ability of the bank providing commitment under the facility to provide fund when their obligation to do so arise systematic risk of the banking system and the financial market could prevent bank from meeting it obligation under the facility agreement duke energy maintains revolving credit facility to provide backup for it commercial paper program and letter of credit to support variable rate demand tax exempt bond that may be put to the duke energy registrant issuer at the option of the holder the facility includes borrowing sublimits for the duke energy registrant each of is party to the credit facility and financial covenant that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding percentage of the total capital for the specific entity failure to maintain these covenant at particular entity could preclude duke energy from issuing commercial paper or the duke energy registrant from issuing letter of credit or borrowing under the master credit facility the duke energy registrant must meet credit quality standard and there is no assurance they will maintain investment grade credit rating if the duke energy registrant are unable to maintain investment grade credit rating they would be required under credit agreement to provide collateral in the form of letter of credit or cash which may materially adversely affect their liquidity each of the duke energy registrant senior long term debt issuance is currently rated investment grade by various rating agency the duke energy registrant can not ensure their senior long term debt will be rated investment grade in the future if the rating agency were to rate the duke energy registrant below investment grade borrowing cost would increase perhaps significantly in addition the potential pool of investor and funding source would likely decrease further if the short term debt rating were to fall access to the commercial paper market could be significantly limited downgrade below investment grade could also require the posting of additional collateral in the form of letter of credit or cash under various credit commodity and capacity agreement and trigger termination clause in some interest rate derivative agreement which would require cash payment all of these event would likely reduce the duke energy registrant liquidity and profitability and could have material effect on their financial position result of operation or cash flow non compliance with debt covenant or condition could adversely affect the duke energy registrant ability to execute future borrowing the duke energy registrant debt and credit agreement contain various financial and other covenant failure to meet those covenant beyond applicable grace period could result in accelerated due date and or termination of the agreement imarket performance and other change may decrease the value of the ndtf investment of duke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida which then could require significant additional funding ownership and operation of nuclear generation facility also requires the maintenance of funded trust that are intended to pay for the decommissioning cost of the respective nuclear power plant the performance of the capital market affect the value of the asset held in trust to satisfy these future obligation duke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida have significant obligation in this area and hold significant asset in these trust these asset are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain return which may fall below projected rate of return although number of factor impact funding requirement decline in the market value of the asset may increase the funding requirement of the obligation for decommissioning nuclear plant if duke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida are unable to successfully manage their ndtf asset their financial condition result of operation and cash flow could be negatively affected poor investment performance of the duke energy pension plan holding and other factor impacting pension plan cost could unfavorably impact the duke energy registrant liquidity and result of operation the cost of providing non contributory defined benefit pension plan are dependent upon number of factor such the rate of return on plan asset discount rate the level of interest rate used to measure the required minimum funding level of the plan future government regulation and required or voluntary contribution made to the plan the subsidiary registrant are allocated their proportionate share of the cost and obligation related to these plan without sustained growth in the pension investment over time to increase the value of plan asset and depending upon the other factor impacting cost listed above duke energy could be required to fund it plan with significant amount of cash such cash funding obligation and the subsidiary

the consolidated financial statement regulatory matter for more in depth discussion of regulatory asset and liability regulated operation accounting rule also require recognition of disallowance also called impairment loss if it becomes probable that part of the cost of plant under construction or recently completed or an abandoned plant will be disallowed for ratemaking purpose and reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made for example if cost cap is set for plant still under construction the amount of the disallowance is result of judgment to the ultimate cost of the plant other disallowances can require judgment on allowed future rate recovery see note to the consolidated financial statement regulatory matter for discussion of disallowances recorded related to the edwardsport igcc plant the retired crystal river unit nuclear plant crystal river unit and the grid infrastructure improvement plan when it becomes probable that regulated asset will be abandoned the cost of the asset is removed from plant in service the value that may be retained regulatory asset on the balance sheet for the abandoned property is dependent upon amount that may be recovered through regulated rate including any return such an impairment charge if any could be partially or fully offset by the establishment of regulatory asset if rate recovery is probable the impairment for disallowance of cost for regulated plant under construction recently completed or abandoned is based on discounted cash flow for further information see note to the consolidated financial statement regulatory matter goodwill impairment assessmentsduke energy allocates goodwill to reporting unit which are either the business segment listed in note to the consolidated financial statement or one level below based on how the business segment is managed duke energy is required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if it is more likely than not that the fair value is le than the carrying value duke energy performs it annual impairment test of august application of the goodwill impairment test requires management judgment including determining the fair value of the reporting unit which management estimate using weighted combination of the income approach which estimate fair value based on discounted cash flow and the market approach which estimate fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industry significant assumption used in these fair value analysis include discount and growth rate future rate of return expected to result from ongoing rate regulation utility sector market performance and transaction projected operating and capital cash flow for duke energy business and the fair value of debt iiestimated future cash flow under the income approach are based to large extent on duke energy internal business plan and adjusted appropriate for duke energy view of market participant assumption duke energy internal business plan reflects management assumption related to customer usage and attrition based on internal data and economic data obtained from third party source projected commodity pricing data and potential change in environmental regulation the business plan assumes the occurrence of certain event in the future such the outcome of future rate filing future approved rate of return on equity anticipated earnings return related to significant future capital investment continued recovery of cost of service the renewal of certain contract and the future of renewable tax credit management also make assumption regarding operation maintenance and general and administrative cost based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned event in estimating cash flow duke energy incorporates expected growth rate regulatory and economic stability the ability to renew contract and other factor into it revenue and expense forecast one of the most significant assumption that duke energy utilizes in determining the fair value of it reporting unit under the income approach is the discount rate applied to the estimated future cash flow management determines the appropriate discount rate for each of it reporting unit based on the weighted average cost of capital wacc for each individual reporting unit the wacc take into account both the after tax cost of debt and cost of equity major component of the cost of equity is the current risk free rate on year treasury bond in the impairment test duke energy considered implied waccs for certain peer company in determining the appropriate wacc rate to use in it analysis each reporting unit ha different risk profile based on the nature of it operation including factor such regulation the wacc for each reporting unit may differ accordingly the waccs were adjusted appropriate to account for company specific risk premium the discount rate used for calculating the fair value of august for each of duke energy domestic reporting unit ranged from percent to percent the underlying assumption and estimate are made of point in time subsequent change particularly change in the discount rate authorized regulated rate of return or growth rate inherent in management estimate of future cash flow could result in future impairment charge for duke energy international operation country specific risk adder based on the average risk premium for each separate country in which international energy operates wa added to the base discount rate to reflect the differing risk profile this resulted in discount rate for the august goodwill impairment test for the international operation of percent in december duke energy disposed of it international operation and no longer ha goodwill associated with the international operation for further information see note to the consolidated financial statement acquisition and disposition duke energy primarily operates in environment that are either fully or partially rate regulated in such environment revenue requirement are adjusted periodically by regulator based on factor including level of cost sale volume and cost of capital accordingly duke energy regulated utility operate to some degree with buffer from the direct effect positive or negative of significant swing in market or economic condition however significant change in discount rate over prolonged period may have material impact on the fair value of equity of august all of the reporting unit estimated fair value of equity substantially exceeded the carrying value of equity for further information see note to the consolidated financial statement goodwill and intangible asset asset retirement obligationsaros are recognized for legal obligation associated with the retirement of property plant and equipment substantially all aros are related to regulated operation when recording an aro the present value of the projected liability is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if reasonable estimate of fair value can be made the liability is accreted over time for operating plant the present value of the liability is added to the cost of the associated asset and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset for retired plant the present value of the liability is recorded regulatory asset unless determined not to be recoverable the present value of the initial obligation and subsequent update are based on discounted cash flow which include estimate regarding timing of future cash flow selection of discount rate and cost escalation rate among other factor these estimate are subject to change depreciation expense is adjusted prospectively for any change to the carrying amount of the associated asset the duke energy registrant receive amount to fund the cost of the aro for regulated operation through combination of regulated revenue and earnings on the nuclear decommissioning trust fund ndtf result amount recovered in regulated revenue

asset group will be sold indicate the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable the determination of whether an impairment ha occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flow attributable to the asset compared with their carrying value iiperforming an impairment evaluation involves significant degree of estimation and judgment in area such identifying circumstance that indicate an impairment may exist identifying and grouping affected asset and developing the undiscounted future cash flow if an impairment ha occurred the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value and recording loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value additionally determining fair value requires probability weighting future cash flow to reflect expectation about possible variation in their amount or timing and the selection of an appropriate discount rate although cash flow estimate are based on relevant information available at the time the estimate are made estimate of future cash flow are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual result for asset identified held for sale the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value le cost to sell to determine if an impairment loss is required until the asset are disposed of their estimated fair value is re evaluated when circumstance or event change when determining whether an asset or asset group ha been impaired management group asset at the lowest level that ha discrete cash flow revenue recognition revenue are recognized when either the electric service is provided or the natural gas is delivered retail meter are read invoice are prepared and the invoice amount is generally recognized billed revenue operating revenue also include unbilled electric and natural gas revenue for the amount of service provided or product delivered after the last meter reading prior to the end of the accounting period unbilled retail revenue are estimated by applying an average revenue per kilowatt hour kwh per thousand cubic foot mcf or per dekatherm dth for all customer class to the number of estimated kwh mcf or dth delivered but not yet billed for wholesale customer the invoice amount is generally recognized billed revenue although meter are read of the end of the month invoice have typically not been prepared an estimate of the wholesale invoice is included in the reported amount of unbilled revenue in addition adjustment to account receivable or accrual of account payable are sometimes recorded to contract billed under estimated formula rate which are subsequently trued up in the following year the amount of unbilled revenue can vary significantly from period to period result of numerous factor that impact the change in the unbilled revenue receivable balance including seasonality weather customer usage pattern customer mix timing of rendering customer bill meter reading schedule and the average price in effect for customer class pension and other post retirement benefitsthe calculation of pension expense other post retirement benefit expense and net pension and other post retirement asset or liability require the use of assumption and election of permissible accounting alternative change in assumption can result in different expense and reported asset or liability amount and future actual experience can differ from the assumption duke energy belief the most critical assumption for pension and other post retirement benefit are the expected long term rate of return on plan asset and the assumed discount rate applied to future projected benefit payment additionally the health care cost trend rate assumption is critical to duke energy estimate of other post retirement benefit duke energy elect to amortize net actuarial gain or loss in excess of the corridor of percent of the greater of the market related value of plan asset or plan projected benefit obligation into net pension or other post retirement benefit expense over the average remaining service period of active covered employee prior service cost or credit which represents the effect on plan liability due to plan

december duke energy assumes pension and other post retirement plan asset will generate long term rate of return of percent percent for piedmont pension and other post retirement plan asset the expected long term rate of return wa developed using weighted average calculation of expected return based primarily on future expected return across asset class considering the use of active asset manager where applicable equity security are held for their higher expected return debt security are primarily held to hedge the pension liability hedge fund real estate and other global security are held for diversification investment within asset class are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual manager on investment in duke energy adopted de risking investment strategy for it pension asset the funded status of the plan increase over time the targeted allocation to return seeking asset will be reduced and the targeted allocation to fixed income asset will be increased to better manage duke energy pension asset and reduce funded status volatility based on the current funded status of the plan the asset allocation for the duke energy pension plan is percent fixed income asset and percent return seeking asset the asset allocation for the piedmont asset is percent return seeking asset and percent liability hedging fixed income asset duke energy regularly review it actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances it investment to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate iithe asset for duke energy pension and other post

beneficiary association trust and mutual fund within piedmont account excludes account within the master retirement trust the investment objective is to achieve sufficient return subject to prudent level of portfolio risk for the purpose of promoting the security of plan benefit for participant duke energy discounted it future pension and other post retirement obligation using rate of percent of december discount rate used to measure benefit plan obligation for financial reporting purpose reflect rate at which pension benefit could be effectively settled of december duke energy determined it discount rate for pension and other post retirement obligation using bond selection settlement portfolio approach this approach develops discount rate by selecting portfolio of high quality corporate bond that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected benefit payment of the plan the selected bond portfolio is derived from universe of non callable corporate bond rated aa quality or higher after the bond portfolio is selected single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan projected benefit payment discounted at this rate with the market value of the bond selected future change in plan asset return assumed discount rate and various other factor related to the participant in duke energy pension and post retirement plan will impact future pension

hedge or do not qualify for hedge accounting these instrument are referred to undesignated contract mark to market change for undesignated contract entered into by regulated business are reflected regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet undesignated contract entered into by unregulated business are marked to market each period with change in the fair value of the derivative instrument reflected in earnings duke energy may also enter into other contract that qualify for the npns exception when contract meet the criterion to qualify npns duke energy applies such exception income recognition and realization related to npns contract generally coincide with the physical delivery of the commodity for contract qualifying for the npns exception no recognition of the contract fair value in the consolidated financial statement is required until settlement of the contract long the transaction remains probable of occurring iigeneration portfolio risk duke energy is primarily exposed to market price fluctuation of wholesale power natural gas and coal price in the electric utility and gas utility segment the duke energy registrant optimize the value of their generation portfolio which include generation asset fuel and emission allowance modeled forecast of future generation output and fuel requirement are based on forward power and fuel market the component piece of the portfolio are bought and sold based on model and forecast of generation in order to manage the economic value of the portfolio in accordance with the strategy of the business unit for the electric utility segment the generation portfolio not utilized to serve retail operation or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuation however the impact on the consolidated statement of operation is partially offset by mechanism in these regulated jurisdiction that result in the sharing of net profit from these activity with retail customer interest rate riskduke energy is exposed to risk resulting from change in interest rate result of it issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper duke energy manages interest rate exposure by limiting variable rate exposure to percentage of total debt and by monitoring the effect of market change in interest rate duke energy also enters into financial derivative instrument which may include instrument such but not limited to interest rate swap swaptions and treasury lock agreement to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure see note and to the consolidated financial statement summary of significant accounting policy debt and credit facility derivative and hedging and fair value measurement at december duke energy had million notional amount of floating to fixed swap outstanding million notional amount of fixed to floating swap outstanding and million forward starting swap outstanding duke energy had billion of unhedged long and short term floating interest rate exposure at december the impact of basis point change in interest rate on pretax income is approximately million at december this amount wa estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on variable rate security outstanding adjusted for interest rate hedge of december see note derivative and hedging to the consolidated financial statement for additional information about the forward starting interest rate swap related to the piedmont acquisition credit riskcredit risk represents the loss that the duke energy registrant would incur if counterparty fails to perform under it contractual obligation where exposed to credit risk the duke energy registrant analyze the counterparty financial condition prior to entering into an agreement and monitor exposure on an ongoing basis the duke energy registrant establish credit limit where appropriate in the context of contractual arrangement and monitor such limit to reduce credit exposure the duke energy registrant seek to include netting provision with counterparties which permit the offset of receivables and payable with such counterparties the duke energy registrant also frequently use master agreement with credit support annex to further mitigate certain credit exposure the master agreement provide for counterparty to post cash or letter of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold the threshold amount represents negotiated unsecured credit limit for each party to the agreement determined in accordance with the duke energy registrant internal corporate credit practice and standard collateral agreement generally also provide that the inability to post collateral is sufficient cause to terminate contract and liquidate all position the duke energy registrant also obtain cash or letter of credit from certain counterparties to provide credit support outside of collateral agreement where appropriate based on financial analysis of the counterparty and the

ruleon december the epa proposed rule to lower the cross state air pollution rule csapr phase state ozone season nitrogen oxide nox emission budget for eastern state including north carolina ohio kentucky and indiana the epa also proposed to eliminate the csapr phase ozone season state nox budget for florida and south carolina on september the epa finalized csapr update rule that reduces the csapr phase state ozone season nox emission budget for eastern state including ohio kentucky and indiana in the final csapr update rule the epa removed florida south carolina and north carolina from the ozone season nox program beginning in duke energy registrant in these state will not be subject to any csapr ozone season nox emission limitation for the state that remain in the program the reduced state ozone season nox emission budget will take effect on may in kentucky and indiana where duke energy registrant own and operate coal fired egus subject to the final rule requirement potential near term response could include changing unit dispatch to run certain generating unit le frequently and or purchasing nox allowance from the trading market longer term upgrading the performance of existing nox control is an option carbon pollution standard for new modified and reconstructed power plantson october the epa published final rule in the federal register establishing carbon dioxide emission limit for new modified and reconstructed power plant the requirement for new plant do not apply to any facility that duke energy currently ha in operation but would apply to plant that commenced construction after january the epa set an emission standard for coal unit of pound of per gross mwh which would require the application of partial carbon capture and storage cc technology for coal unit to be able to meet the limit utility scale cc is not currently demonstrated and commercially available technology for coal fired egus and therefore the final standard effectively prevents the development of new coal fired generation the epa set final standard of pound of per gross mwh for new natural gas combined cycle unit petition challenging the rule have been filed by several group final brief in the case were due february oral argument are scheduled for april the duke energy registrant do not expect the impact of the final standard will be material to duke energy financial position result of operation or cash flow clean power plan on october the epa published in the federal register the final clean power plan cpp rule that regulates emission from existing fossil fuel fired egus the cpp established emission rate and mass cap goal that apply to existing fossil fuel fired egus petition challenging the rule have been filed by several group and on february the supreme court issued stay of the final cpp rule halting implementation of the cpp until legal challenge are resolved state in which the duke energy registrant operate have suspended work on the cpp in response to the stay oral argument before of the judge on circuit court were heard on september the court is expected to decide the case in early compliance with cpp could cause the industry to replace coal fired generation with natural gas and renewables cost to operate coal fired generation plant continue to grow due to increasing environmental compliance requirement including ash management cost unrelated to cpp which may result in the retirement of coal fired generation plant earlier than the current end of useful life if the cpp is ultimately upheld by the court and implementation go forward the duke energy registrant could incur increased fuel purchased power operation and maintenance and other cost for replacement generation result of this rule due to the uncertainty related to the implementation of the cpp the duke energy registrant can not predict the outcome of these matter global climate changethe duke energy registrant greenhouse gas ghg emission consist primarily of and result primarily from operating fleet of coal fired power plant in the duke energy registrant power plant emitted approximately million ton of future emission will be influenced by variable that include compliance with new or existing regulation economic condition that affect electricity demand and the technology deployed to generate the electricity necessary to meet the customer demand the duke energy registrant have taken action that have resulted in reduction of emission over time action have included the retirement of coal fired egus with combined generating capacity of mw much of that capacity ha been replaced with state of the art highly efficient natural gas fired generation that produce far fewer emission per unit of electricity generated between and the duke energy registrant have collectively lowered the emission from their electricity generation by approximately percent which lower the exposure to any future mandatory emission reduction requirement or carbon tax whether result of federal legislation the final cpp regulation or other yet unknown emission reduction requirement under any future scenario involving mandatory limitation the duke energy registrant would plan to seek recovery of their compliance cost through appropriate regulatory mechanism the duke energy registrant recognize certain group associate severe weather event with increasing level of ghgs in the atmosphere and forecast the possibility these weather event could have material impact on future result of operation should they occur more frequently and with greater severity however the uncertain nature of potential change in extreme weather event such increased frequency duration and severity the long period of time over which any potential change might take place and the inability to predict potential change with any degree of accuracy make estimating any potential future financial risk to the duke energy registrant operation impossible the duke energy registrant have historically planned and prepared for extreme weather event such ice storm tornado hurricane severe thunderstorm high wind and drought they occasionally experience iithe duke energy registrant routinely take step to reduce the potential impact of severe weather event on their electric distribution system the duke energy registrant electric generating facility are designed to withstand extreme weather event without significant damage the duke energy registrant maintain an inventory of coal and oil on site to mitigate the effect of any potential short term disruption in fuel supply so they can continue to provide customer with an uninterrupted supply of electricity nuclear mattersfollowing the event at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station in japan in march the nrc formed task force to conduct comprehensive review of process and regulation to determine whether the agency should make additional improvement to the nuclear regulatory system subsequently the nrc targeted set of improvement designed to enhance accident mitigation strengthen emergency preparedness and improve efficiency of nrc program pursuant to the finding of the task force in march the nrc issued three regulatory order requiring safety enhancement related to mitigation strategy to respond to extreme natural event resulting in the loss of power at plant ensuring reliable hardened containment vent and enhancing spent fuel pool instrumentation duke energy is committed to compliance with all safety enhancement ordered by the nrc and of january duke energy action on two of the three nrc order are complete the remaining order is focused only on enhancement to boiling water reactor design which for duke energy is unique to brunswick steam electric plant action associated with this third order will be completed by march with the nrc continuing review of this matter duke energy can not predict to what extent the nrc will impose

investment in equity security are typically valued at the closing price in the principal active market of the last business day of the quarter principal active market for equity price include

close of the principal active market there wa no after hour market activity that wa required to be reflected in the reported fair value measurement investment in debt securitiesmost investment in debt security are valued using level measurement because the valuation use interest rate curve and credit spread applied to the term of the debt instrument maturity and coupon interest rate and consider the counterparty credit rating if the market for particular fixed income security is relatively inactive or illiquid the measurement is level commodity derivativescommodity derivative with

ask spread and credit or non performance risk after reflecting credit enhancement such collateral and are discounted to present value pricing input are derived from published exchange transaction price and other observable data source in the absence of an active market the last available price may be used if forward price curve are not observable for the full term of the contract and the unobservable period had more than an insignificant impact on the valuation the commodity derivative is classified level in isolation increase decrease in natural gas forward price result in favorable unfavorable fair value adjustment for gas purchase contract and increase decrease in electricity forward price result in unfavorable favorable fair value adjustment for electricity sale contract duke energy regularly evaluates and validates pricing input used to estimate the fair value of gas commodity contract by market participant price verification procedure this procedure provides comparison

affiliated company in the above table for duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana reflect their retained interest in receivables sold to crc these subordinated note held by duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana are stated at fair value carrying value of retained interest are determined by allocating carrying value of the receivables between asset sold and interest retained based on relative fair value the allocated base of the subordinated note are not materially different than their face value because the receivables generally turnover in le than two month ii credit loss are reasonably predictable due to the broad customer base and lack of significant concentration and iii the equity in crc is subordinate to all retained interest and thus would absorb loss first the hypothetical effect on fair value of the retained interest assuming both percent and percent unfavorable variation in credit loss or discount rate is not material due to the short turnover of receivables and historically low credit loss history interest accrues to duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana on the retained interest using the acceptable yield method this method generally approximates the stated rate on the note since the allocated basis and the face value are nearly equivalent an impairment charge is recorded against the carrying value of both retained interest and purchased
