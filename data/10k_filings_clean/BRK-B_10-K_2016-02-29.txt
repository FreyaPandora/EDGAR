subject to certain risk and uncertainty in it business operation which are described below the risk and uncertainty described below are not the only risk we face additional risk and uncertainty that are presently unknown or are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operation we are dependent on few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decision major investment decision and all major capital allocation decision are made by warren buffett chairman of the board of director and ceo age in consultation with charles munger vice chairman of the board of director age if for any reason the service of our key personnel particularly mr buffett were to become unavailable there could be material adverse effect on our operation however berkshire board of director ha identified certain current berkshire subsidiary manager who in their judgment are capable of succeeding mr buffett berkshire board ha agreed on replacement for mr buffett should replacement be needed currently the board continually monitor this risk and could alter it current view regarding replacement for mr buffett in the future we believe that the board succession plan together with the outstanding manager running our numerous and highly diversified operating unit help to mitigate this risk we need qualified personnel to manage and operate our various business in our decentralized business model we need qualified and competent management to direct day to day business activity of our operating subsidiary our operating subsidiary also need qualified and competent personnel in executing their business plan and serving their customer supplier and other stakeholder change in demographic training requirement and the unavailability of qualified personnel could negatively impact our operating subsidiary ability to meet demand of customer to supply good and service recruiting and retaining qualified personnel is important to all of our operation although we have adequate personnel for the current business environment unpredictable increase in demand for good and service may exacerbate the risk of not sufficient number of trained personnel which could have negative impact on our operating result financial condition and liquidity table of content the past growth rate in berkshire book value per share is not an indication of future result in the year since our present management acquired control of berkshire our book value per share ha grown at highly satisfactory rate because of the large size of our capital base berkshire shareholder equity of approximately billion of december our book value per share will very likely not increase in the future at rate close to it past rate investment are unusually concentrated and fair value are subject to loss in value we concentrate high percentage of the investment of our insurance subsidiary in small number of equity security and diversify our investment portfolio far le than is conventional in the insurance industry significant decline in the fair value of our larger investment may produce material decline in our consolidated shareholder equity and our consolidated book value per share under certain circumstance significant decline in the fair value of these investment may require the recognition of other than temporary impairment loss since large percentage of our investment are held in our insurance subsidiary decrease in the fair value of our investment could produce large decline in statutory surplus our large statutory surplus is competitive advantage and material decline could have materially adverse affect on our ability to write new insurance business thus affecting our future underwriting profitability competition and technology may erode our business franchise and result in lower earnings each of our operating business face intense competitive pressure within market in which they operate while we manage our business with the objective of achieving long term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantage many factor including market and technology change may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantage accordingly future operating result will depend to some degree on whether our operating unit are successful in protecting or enhancing their competitive advantage if our operating business are unsuccessful in these effort our periodic operating result in the future may decline from current level deterioration of general economic condition may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to access capital market at reasonable cost our operating business are subject to normal economic cycle affecting the economy in general or the industry in which they operate to the extent that the economy deteriorates for prolonged period of time one or more of our significant operation could be materially harmed in addition our utility and energy business our railroad business and our manufactured housing business regularly utilize debt component of their capital structure these business depend on having access to borrowed fund through the capital market at reasonable rate to the extent that access to the capital market is restricted or the cost of funding increase these operation could be adversely affected terrorist act against the united state could hurt our operating business successful defined by the aggressor cyber biological nuclear or chemical attack against the united state could produce significant loss to our worldwide operation our business operation could be adversely affected directly through the loss of human resource or destruction of production facility and information system this is risk that we share with all based business regulatory change may adversely impact our future operating result in recent year partially in response to financial market crisis global economic recession and social and environmental issue regulatory initiative have accelerated in the united state and abroad such initiative address for example the regulation of bank and other major financial institution environmental and global warming matter and health care reform these initiative impact not only our regulated insurance energy and railroad transportation business but also our manufacturing service retailing and financing business increased regulatory compliance cost could have significant negative impact on our operating business well on the business in which we have significant but not controlling economic interest we can not predict whether such initiative will have material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position result of operation or cash flow table of content cyber security risk we rely on information technology in virtually all aspect of our business significant disruption or failure of our information technology system could result in service interruption safety failure security violation regulatory compliance failure an inability to protect information and asset against intruder and other operational difficulty attack perpetrated against our information system could result in loss of asset and critical information and expose to remediation cost and reputational damage although we have taken step intended to mitigate these risk including business continuity planning disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis significant disruption or cyber intrusion could lead to misappropriation of asset or data corruption and could adversely affect our result of operation financial condition and liquidity additionally if we are unable to acquire or implement new technology we may suffer competitive disadvantage which could also have an adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity cyber attack could further adversely affect our ability to operate facility information technology and business system or compromise confidential customer and employee information political economic social or financial market instability or damage to or interference with our operating asset or our customer or supplier may result in business interruption lost revenue higher commodity price disruption in fuel supply lower energy consumption unstable market increased security and repair or other cost any of which may materially adversely affect in way that can not be predicted at this time any of these risk could materially affect our consolidated financial result furthermore instability in the financial market result of terrorism sustained or significant cyber attack or war could also materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital derivative contract may require significant future cash settlement payment and result in significant loss we have assumed the risk of potentially significant loss under equity index put option and credit default contract although we received considerable premium compensation for accepting these risk there is no assurance that the premium we received will exceed our aggregate loss or settlement payment risk of loss under our equity index put option contract are based on decline in equity price of stock comprising certain major stock index when these contract expire beginning in we could be required to make significant payment if equity index price are significantly below the strike price specified in the contract our risk under credit default contract are currently limited to specified municipality the deterioration of the financial condition of the referenced municipality could result in significant loss equity index put option and credit default contract are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet and the periodic change in fair value are reported in earnings the valuation of these contract and the impact on our periodic earnings can be particularly significant reflecting the inherent volatility of equity and credit market adverse change in equity and credit market may result in material loss in periodic earnings risk unique to our regulated business our tolerance for risk in our insurance business may result in significant underwriting loss when properly paid for the risk assumed we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from single event than any other insurer ha knowingly assumed accordingly we could incur significant loss from single event we may also write coverage for loss arising from act of terrorism we attempt to take into account all possible correlation and avoid writing group of policy from which pre tax loss might aggregate above billion currently we estimate that our aggregate exposure from single event under outstanding policy is significantly below billion however it is possible that despite our effort loss may aggregate in way that were not anticipated our tolerance for significant insurance loss may result in lower reported earnings or net loss in future period the degree of estimation error inherent in the process of estimating property and casualty insurance loss reserve may result in significant underwriting loss the principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claim in writing property and casualty insurance policy we receive premium today and promise to pay covered loss in the future however it will take decade before all claim that have occurred of any given balance sheet date will be reported and settled although we believe that liability for unpaid loss are adequate we will not know whether these liability or the premium charged for the coverage provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date except for certain product line our objective is to generate underwriting profit over the long term estimating insurance claim cost is inherently imprecise our estimated unpaid loss arising under contract covering property and casualty insurance risk are large billion at december even small percentage increase to the aggregate liability estimate can result in materially lower future periodic reported earnings table of content change in regulation and regulatory action can adversely affect our operating result and our ability to allocate capital our insurance business are subject to regulation in the jurisdiction in which we operate such regulation may relate to among other thing

the timing and amount of ultimate loss payment are contingent upon among other thing the timing of claim reporting from insured and cedants and the final determination of the loss amount through the

to best suit the underlying claim and available data of any balance sheet date recorded liability include provision for reported claim referred to case reserve and claim that have not been reported referred to incurred but not yet reported ibnr reserve the time period between the loss occurrence date and settlement or payment date is referred to the claim tail property claim usually have fairly short claim tail and absent litigation are reported and settled within few year of occurrence casualty loss usually have longer claim tail occasionally extending for decade casualty claim are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretation the legal environment and judicial process further contributes to extending claim tail table of content management discussion and analysis continued property and casualty loss continued reinsurance receivables are recorded for loss recoverable from third party and are estimated in manner similar to liability for insurance loss reinsurance receivables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract reinsurance contract do not relieve the ceding company of it obligation to indemnify it own policyholder additional information regarding those process and technique of our significant insurance business geico general re and bhrg follows geico geico predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance geico gross unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense liability of december were billion compared to billion of december geico claim reserving methodology produce liability estimate based upon the individual claim or ground up approach which yield an aggregate estimate of the ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense the key assumption affecting our reserve estimate include projection of ultimate claim count frequency and average loss per claim severity we establish and evaluate unpaid loss liability using standard actuarial loss development method and technique the significant component of recorded liability at december included billion of reported average case and case development reserve and billion of ibnr reserve our recorded liability are affected by the expected frequency and average severity of claim we use statistical technique to analyze historical claim data and adjust when appropriate to reflect perceived change in loss pattern we analyze claim data number of way including by rated state reporting date and occurrence date we establish average reserve for reported new auto damage and liability claim prior to the development of an individual case reserve average reserve represent our estimated liability for claim when our adjuster have insufficient time and information to make specific claim estimate and for large number of relatively minor physical damage claim that are paid within relatively short time after being reported aggregate average reserve are driven by the estimated average severity per claim and the number of new claim opened we generally establish individual liability claim case loss reserve estimate the fact and merit of each claim are evaluated case reserve represent the amount that in the judgment of the adjuster are reasonably expected to be paid to completely settle the claim including expense individual case reserve are revised over time information becomes available approximately of geico claim liability of december related to automobile liability coverage of which bodily injury bi coverage accounted for approximately liability estimate for automobile liability coverage such bi uninsured motorist and personal injury protection are more uncertain due to the longer claim tail the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of fact available at the time the case reserve is first established case reserve alone insufficiently measure the ultimate claim cost so we establish additional case development reserve estimate which are usually percentage of the case reserve of december case development reserve averaged approximately of the case reserve case development factor are selected by retrospective analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case reserve and are reviewed and revised periodically for unreported claim ibnr reserve are estimated by first projecting the ultimate number of claim expected reported and unreported for each significant coverage we use historical quarterly and monthly claim count to develop age to age projection of the ultimate count by accident quarter reported claim are deducted from the ultimate claim projection to produce an estimate of the number of unreported claim the number of estimated unreported claim is then multiplied by an estimate of the average cost per unreported claim to produce the ibnr reserve amount actuarial technique are difficult to apply reliably in certain situation such new or changing legal precedent class action suit or recent catastrophe consequently we may establish supplemental ibnr reserve in these situation for significant coverage we test the adequacy of the aggregate liability for unpaid loss using one or more actuarial projection based on claim closure model paid loss triangle and incurred loss triangle each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claim occurring in given period and project the ultimate cost unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense liability estimate recorded at the end of developed downward by million when reevaluated through december the downward revision produced corresponding increase to pre tax earnings in which wa approximately of earned premium and of prior year end recorded net liability in estimated liability for pre occurrence developed downward million or of net liability at december assumption used to estimate liability at december were modified appropriate to reflect the most recent frequency and severity result future development of recorded liability will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or le than anticipated table of content management discussion and analysis continued property and casualty loss continued geico continued we believe it is reasonably possible that the average bi severity will change by at least one percentage point from the severity used in establishing the recorded liability at december we estimate that one percentage point increase or decrease in bi severity would produce million increase or decrease in recorded liability with corresponding decrease or increase in pre tax earnings many of the same economic force that would likely cause bi severity to differ from expectation would likely also cause severity for other injury coverage to differ in the same direction geico exposure to highly uncertain loss is believed to be limited to certain commercial excess umbrella policy written during period from to remaining liability associated with such exposure are currently an immaterial component of geico aggregate reserve approximately general re and bhrg liability for unpaid property and casualty loss and loss adjustment expense of general re and bhrg derive primarily from reinsurance contract in connection with reinsurance contract the nature extent timing and perceived reliability of information received from ceding company varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting term contract term condition and coverage also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than under primary insurance policy the nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative individual risk per occurrence excess or retroactive reinsurance contract may not differ significantly from the information received under primary insurance contract if reinsurer personnel either work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claim or manage the claim themselves however loss information related to aggregate excess of loss contract including catastrophe loss and quota share treaty is often le detailed loss information may be reported in summary format rather than on an individual claim basis loss data is usually provided through periodic report which may include currently recoverable loss well case loss estimate ceding company infrequently provide ibnr estimate to reinsurers the timing of claim reporting to reinsurers is typically delayed compared to primary insurer periodic premium and claim report are required from ceding company in the such report are generally required at quarterly interval ranging from to day after the end of the accounting period outside the reinsurance reporting practice vary in certain country client report annually often to day after the end of the annual period in some instance reinsurers assume and cede part of an underlying risk thereby creating multiple contractual intermediary between general re or bhrg and the primary insured in these instance the claim reporting delay can be compounded the relative impact of reporting delay on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage contractual reporting term and the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance contract and for other reason premium and loss data is provided through at least one intermediary the primary insurer so there is risk that the loss data reported to is incomplete inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage term information provided by ceding company is reviewed for completeness and compliance with the contract term generally bhrg and general re are contractually permitted to access the ceding company book and record with respect to the subject business thus providing the ability to audit the accuracy and completeness of the reported information in the normal course of business dispute with client occasionally arise concerning whether certain claim are covered under our reinsurance policy we resolve most coverage dispute through the involvement of our claim personnel and the appropriate client personnel or through independent outside counsel if dispute can not be resolved our contract generally specify whether arbitration litigation or an alternative dispute resolution process will be invoked there are no coverage dispute at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have material impact on our

claim examiner the determination of expected ultimate loss ratio which drive ibnr reserve amount and the comparison of incurred loss reporting trend to the expected loss reporting pattern by actuarial personnel recorded liability are subject to tail risk where reported loss develop beyond the expected loss emergence time period we do not routinely determine loss reserve range we believe that the technique necessary to make such determination have not sufficiently developed to render meaningful estimate of such range upon notification of reinsurance claim from ceding company we independently evaluate loss amount in some case our estimate differ from amount reported by ceding company if our estimate are significantly greater than the ceding company estimate the claim are further investigated if deemed appropriate we establish acrs above the amount reported by the ceding company of december acrs aggregated approximately billion before discount and were concentrated in worker compensation reserve and to lesser extent in professional liability reserve we also periodically conduct detailed claim review of individual client and case reserve may be increased result we classify all loss and premium data into segment reserve cell primarily based on product treaty facultative and program line of business auto liability property and worker compensation and jurisdiction for each reserve cell premium and loss are aggregated by accident year policy year or underwriting year and analyzed over time we internally refer to these loss aggregation loss triangle which serve the basis for our ibnr reserve calculation globally we review approximately reserve cell we use loss triangle to determine the expected case loss emergence and development pattern for most coverage and in conjunction with expected loss ratio by accident policy or underwriting year we calculate ibnr reserve in instance where the historical loss data is insufficient we may use loss emergence estimation formula along with other loss triangle and actuarial judgment to determine loss emergence pattern factor affecting our loss development triangle include but are not limited to change in the following client claim practice our use of acrs or the frequency of client company claim review policy term and coverage such client loss retention level and occurrence and aggregate policy limit loss trend and legal trend that result in unanticipated loss collectively these factor influence the selection of the expected loss emergence pattern we select expected loss ratio by reserve cell and by accident policy or underwriting year based upon indicated ultimate loss ratio and forecasted loss obtained from aggregated pricing statistic indicated ultimate loss ratio are determined from the selected loss emergence pattern reported loss and earned premium if the selected loss emergence pattern prof to be unreasonable then the indicated ultimate loss ratio may be unreasonable which can then impact the selected loss ratio and the ibnr reserve judgment is necessary in the analysis of indicated ultimate loss ratio and pricing statistic table of content management discussion and analysis continued property and casualty loss continued general re continued we estimate ibnr reserve by reserve cell using the expected loss emergence pattern and the expected loss ratio the expected loss emergence pattern and expected loss ratio are the critical ibnr reserving assumption and are updated annually once the annual ibnr reserve are determined we estimate the expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year based on the prior year end expected loss emergence pattern and expected loss ratio the expected loss are then allocated into interim estimate that are compared to actual reported loss in the subsequent year this comparison provides test of the adequacy of prior year end ibnr reserve and form the basis for possibly changing ibnr reserve assumption during the course of the year during and we reduced net loss for prior year occurrence by million these reduction produced corresponding increase in pre tax earnings in each year in reported claim for prior year worker compensation loss were million le than expected however further analysis of the worker compensation reserve cell by segment indicated the need for maintaining ibnr reserve which precipitated an increase of million in nominal ibnr reserve after adjusting for change in reserve discount the net increase in worker compensation loss from prior year occurrence had minimal impact on pre tax earnings to illustrate the sensitivity of these assumption on significant excess of loss worker compensation reserve cell an increase of ten point in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratio would produce net increase in our nominal ibnr reserve of approximately million and million on discounted basis at december an increase in discounted reserve would produce corresponding decrease in pre tax earnings we believe it is reasonably possible for these assumption to increase at these rate other casualty and general liability reported loss excluding mass tort loss developed favorably in relative to expectation however casualty loss tend to be long tail and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in given year will continue in the future for our significant other casualty and general liability reserve cell we estimate that an increase of five point in the claim tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and five percent increase in expected loss ratio one percent for large international proportional reinsurance reserve cell would produce net increase in our nominal ibnr reserve and corresponding reduction in pre tax earnings of approximately billion this amount includes change in assumption used in certain motor annuity claim liability we believe it is reasonably possible for these assumption to increase at these rate in any of the individual aforementioned reserve cell however given the diversification in worldwide business more likely outcome are believed to be le than billion in certain reserve cell within excess director and officer and error and omission and coverage ibnr reserve are based on estimated ultimate loss without consideration of expected loss emergence pattern for our large and reserve cell an increase of five point in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern for those cell where loss emergence pattern are considered and an increase of five percent in the expected loss ratio would produce net increase in nominal ibnr reserve and corresponding reduction in pre tax earnings of approximately million we believe it is reasonably possible for these assumption to increase at these rate overall industry wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability such in setting the estimate for mass tort asbestos and hazardous waste collectively mass tort claim estimating mass tort loss is very difficult due to the changing legal environment although such reserve are believed to be adequate significant reserve increase may be required in the future if new exposure or claimant are identified new claim are reported or new theory of liability emerge mass tort net claim paid in were million and we increased ultimate loss estimate for such claim by million in addition to the previously described methodology we consider survival ratio based on average net claim payment in recent year versus net unpaid loss rough guide to reserve adequacy our survival ratio wa approximately year of december and year of december the reinsurance industry survival ratio for asbestos and pollution liability wa approximately year of december in reported claim for prior year property loss event were le than expected and we reduced our estimated ultimate liability by million however the nature of property loss experience tends to be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophe and large individual property loss table of content management discussion and analysis continued property and casualty loss continued bhrg bhrg unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense of december are summarized follows amount are in million property casualty total reported case reserve ibnr reserve retroactive reinsurance gross unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense deferred charge and ceded reinsurance receivables net unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense in general we use variety of actuarial methodology to establish unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense liability certain methodology such paid and incurred loss development technique incurred and paid loss bornhuetter ferguson technique and frequency and severity technique are utilized well ground up technique when appropriate large percentage of bhrg aggregate reserve derive from retroactive reinsurance contract gross unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense with respect to such contract were approximately billion at december and were predominately for casualty or liability coverage retroactive reinsurance policy relate to loss event occurring before specified date on or before the contract date and include excess of loss contract in which loss above contractual retention are indemnified and contract that indemnify loss paid by the counterparty immediately after the policy effective date these contract may include significant exposure to asbestos environmental and other latent injury claim the classification reported case reserve ha no practical analytical value with respect to our retroactive policy we review and establish loss reserve estimate in the aggregate by individual contract considering exposure and development trend in establishing retroactive reinsurance liability we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment pattern and project loss into the future under various scenario the claim tail is expected to be very long for many policy and may last several decade we assign judgmental probability factor to these aggregate loss payment scenario and an expectancy outcome is determined we monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company report and other information concerning the underlying loss since the claim tail is expected to be very long for such contract we reassess expected ultimate loss significant event related to the underlying loss are reported or revealed during the monitoring and review process bhrg liability under retroactive reinsurance include estimated liability for environmental asbestos and latent injury loss of approximately billion at december we do not receive consistently reliable information regarding asbestos environmental and latent injury claim data from all ceding company particularly with respect to multi line treaty or aggregate excess of loss policy periodically we conduct ground up analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured loss when detailed loss information is unavailable our estimate are developed by applying recent industry trend and projection to aggregate client data judgment in these area necessarily include the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which these claim will be adjudicated legal reform and legislation could also have significant impact on the ultimate liability for mass tort claim we increased ultimate liability for prior year retroactive reinsurance contract by approximately million in the increase primarily related to asbestos and environmental risk assumed the increase net of deferred charge balance adjustment related to change in estimated timing and amount of remaining unpaid liability produced charge to pre tax earnings of approximately million we paid loss and loss adjustment expense of approximately billion in with respect to our retroactive reinsurance contract we currently believe that maximum loss payable under our retroactive policy will not exceed approximately billion due to the aggregate contract limit that are applicable to most of these contract absent significant judicial or legislative change affecting asbestos environmental or latent injury exposure we also currently believe it unlikely that our reported year end gross unpaid loss of billion will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than table of content management discussion and analysis continued property and casualty loss continued bhrg continued gross unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense liability related to property and casualty contract other than retroactive reinsurance were approximately billion of december and consisted of traditional property and casualty coverage written primarily under excess of loss and quota share treaty and to lesser extent under individual risk contract these coverage included catastrophe and aviation contract that periodically generate low frequency high severity loss reserving technique for catastrophe and individual risk contract generally rely more on per policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development pattern of past loss absent litigation affecting the interpretation of coverage term the expected claim tail is relatively short and thus the estimation error in the initial reserve estimate usually emerges within month after the loss event under most of our non catastrophe property and casualty treaty liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense are generally based upon loss estimate reported by ceding company and ibnr reserve that are primarily function of reported loss from ceding company and anticipated loss ratio established on portfolio basis supplemented by management estimate of the impact of major catastrophe event they become known anticipated loss ratio are based upon management judgment considering the type of business covered analysis of each ceding company loss history and evaluation of that portion of the underlying contract underwritten by each ceding company which are in turn ceded to bhrg range of reserve amount result of change in underlying assumption is not prepared for bhrg property casualty contract other than retroactive reinsurance we decreased estimated ultimate loss for prior year occurrence by approximately million in which primarily derived from lower than expected loss reported by ceding company the decrease produced corresponding increase in pre tax earnings derivative contract liability our consolidated balance sheet include derivative contract liability that are measured at fair value our most significant derivative contract exposure relate to equity index put option contract written between and these contract were entered into in over the counter market we believe that the fair value produced for long duration option are inherently subjective the value of contract in an actual exchange are affected by market condition and perception of the buyer and seller actual value in an exchange may differ significantly from the value produced by any mathematical model we determine the estimated fair value of equity index put option contract using black scholes based option valuation model input to the model include the current index value strike price interest rate dividend rate and contract expiration date the weighted average interest and dividend rate used of december and december were and respectively the interest rate of december and were approximately basis point and basis point on weighted average basis respectively over benchmark interest rate and represented our estimate of our nonperformance risk we believe that the most significant economic risk under these contract relate to change in the index value component and to lesser degree the foreign currency component the black scholes based model also incorporates volatility estimate that measure potential price change over time our contract have an average remaining maturity of about year the weighted average volatility used of december wa approximately compared to of december the weighted average volatility are based on the volatility input for each contract weighted by the contract notional value the volatility input for each contract reflects our expectation of future price volatility the impact on fair value of december billion from change in the volatility assumption is summarized in the table that follows dollar are in million hypothetical change in volatility hypothetical fair value increase percentage point increase percentage point decrease percentage point decrease percentage point for several year we also wrote number of credit default contract involving corporate and state municipality issuer at december our remaining exposure relate to state municipality exposure which begin to expire in the fair value of our state municipality contract is generally based on pricing data and current rating on the underlying bond issue and credit spread estimate we monitor and review pricing data and spread estimate for consistency well reasonableness with respect to current market condition table of content management discussion and analysis continued other critical accounting policy we record deferred charge with respect to liability assumed under retroactive reinsurance contract at the inception of these contract the deferred charge represent the excess if any of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid loss over the consideration received deferred charge are amortized using the interest method over an estimate of the ultimate claim payment period with the periodic amortization reflected in earnings component of loss and loss adjustment expense deferred charge balance are adjusted periodically to reflect new projection of the amount and timing of remaining loss payment adjustment to deferred charge balance resulting from change to these assumption are determined retrospectively from the inception of the contract unamortized deferred charge were approximately billion at december significant change in the estimated amount and the timing of payment of unpaid loss may have significant effect on unamortized deferred charge and the amount of periodic amortization our consolidated balance sheet includes goodwill of acquired business of billion we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of our review includes determining the estimated fair value of our reporting unit there are several method of estimating reporting unit fair value including market quotation underlying asset and liability fair value determination and other valuation technique such discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flow and multiple of earnings we primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow method the key assumption and input used in such method may include forecasting revenue and expense operating cash flow and capital expenditure well an appropriate discount rate and other input significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment test due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flow and earnings actual result may vary significantly from the forecast if the carrying amount of reporting unit including goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value then required by gaap we estimate the fair value of the identifiable asset and liability of the reporting unit the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of it net asset establishes the implied value of goodwill the excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied value is charged to earnings an impairment loss market risk disclosure our consolidated balance sheet include substantial amount of asset and liability whose fair value are subject to market risk our significant market risk are primarily associated with equity price interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price the fair value of our investment portfolio and equity index put option contract remain subject to considerable volatility the following section address the significant market risk associated with our business activity equity price risk historically we have maintained large amount of invested asset in exchange traded equity security strategically we strive to invest in business that posse excellent economics with able and honest management and at sensible price and prefer to invest meaningful amount in each investee consequently equity investment are concentrated in relatively few issuer at december approximately of the total fair value of equity investment wa concentrated within four company we often hold equity investment for long period of time so we are not troubled by short term price volatility with respect to our investment provided that the underlying business economic and management characteristic of the investees remain favorable we strive to maintain significant level of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide margin of safety against short term price volatility market price for equity security are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value fluctuation in the market price of security may result from perceived change in the underlying economic characteristic of the investee the relative price of alternative investment and general market condition we are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contract while our ultimate liability with respect to these contract is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date fair value of these contract are also affected by change in other factor such interest rate expected dividend rate and the remaining duration of the contract table of content

to asset we also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operation business acquisition and for other general purpose we strive to maintain high credit rating so that the cost of our debt is minimized we rarely utilize derivative product such interest rate swap to manage interest rate risk the fair value of our fixed maturity investment and note payable and other borrowing will fluctuate in response to change in market interest rate in addition change in interest rate assumption used in our equity index put option contract model cause change in reported liability with respect to those contract increase and decrease in interest rate generally translate into decrease and increase in fair value of those instrument additionally fair value of interest rate sensitive instrument may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer prepayment option relative value of alternative investment the liquidity of the instrument and other general market condition the fair

transact business in foreign currency we generally do not use derivative contract to hedge foreign currency price change primarily because of the natural hedging that occurs between asset and liability denominated in foreign currency in our consolidated financial statement in addition we hold investment in common stock of major multinational company such the coca cola company that have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own our net asset subject to translation are primarily in our insurance utility and energy and certain manufacturing and service

price risk related to various commodity in most instance we attempt to manage these risk through the pricing of our product and service to customer to the extent that we are unable to sustain price increase in response to commodity price increase our operating result will likely be adversely affected we utilize derivative contract to limited degree in managing commodity price risk most notably at bhe bhe exposure to commodity include variation in the price of fuel required to generate electricity wholesale electricity that is purchased and sold and natural gas supply for customer commodity
