january an indictment for alleged violation of antitrust law wa issued by the doj against our subsidiary surgical care affiliate sca based on conduct alleged to have begun more than five year prior to our acquisition of sca we are vigorously defending this lawsuit but if sca is found liable we may be subject to criminal fine or reputational harm if we of contentscannot successfully integrate our

adversely affected we expand and operate our business outside of the united state we are presented with challenge differing from those presented by acquisition of domestic business including challenge in adapting to new market language business labor and cultural practice and regulatory environment adapting to these challenge could require to devote significant senior management attention and other resource to the acquired business before we realize anticipated synergy or other benefit from those business these challenge vary widely by country and outside of the united state may include

may not be sufficient to cover our medical and administrative cost deferred medical care could be sought in future period at potentially higher acuity level we could experience reduced demand for our service our clinical and non clinical workforce could be impacted resulting in reduced capacity to handle demand for care or otherwise impact our business operation for example covid ha materially impacted our result of operation in previous period public health crisis arising from natural disaster such wildfire hurricane and snowstorm or effect of climate change could impact our business

we do not have other significant contractual obligation or commitment requiring cash resource however we continually evaluate opportunity to expand our operation which include internal development of

subjective or complex judgment often because they must estimate the effect of matter inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent period critical accounting estimate involve judgment and uncertainty which are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different result under different assumption and condition medical cost payablemedical cost and medical cost payable include estimate of our obligation for medical care service rendered on behalf of consumer but for which claim have either not yet been received or processed depending on the health care professional and type of service the typical billing lag for service can be up to day from the date of service approximately of claim related to medical care service are known and settled within day from the date of service in each reporting period our operating result include the effect of more completely developed medical cost payable estimate associated with previously reported period if the revised estimate of prior period medical cost is le than the previous estimate we will decrease reported medical cost in the current period favorable development if the revised estimate of prior period medical cost is more than the previous estimate we will increase reported medical cost in the current period unfavorable development medical cost in and included favorable medical cost development related to prior year of million billion and million respectively in developing our medical cost payable estimate we apply different estimation method depending on the month for which incurred claim are being estimated for example for the most recent two month we estimate claim cost incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factor to the average per member per month pmpm medical cost incurred in prior month for which more complete claim data is available supplemented by review of near term completion factor completion factor completion factor is an actuarial estimate based upon historical experience and analysis of current trend of the percentage of incurred claim during given period adjudicated by at the date of estimation completion factor are the most significant factor we use in developing our medical cost payable estimate for period prior to the most recent two month completion factor include judgment in relation to claim submission such the time from date of service to claim receipt claim level and processing cycle well other factor if actual claim submission rate from provider which can be influenced by number of factor including provider mix and electronic versus

december completion factor decrease increase in factorsincrease decrease in medical cost payable in million medical cost per member per month trend factor medical cost pmpm trend factor are significant factor we use in developing our medical cost payable estimate for the most recent two month medical cost trend factor are developed through comprehensive analysis of claim incurred in

trend inpatient hospital authorization data and seasonal and other incidence data from the national center for disease control we also consider macroeconomic variable such gdp growth employment and

experience estimating liability for incurred but not reported benefit claim management belief the amount of medical cost payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claim of december however actual claim payment may differ from established estimate discussed above assuming hypothetical difference between our december estimate of medical cost payable and actual medical cost payable excluding aarp medicare supplement insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebate net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately million for more detail related to our medical cost estimate see note of the note to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data goodwillwe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstance change indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable when testing goodwill for impairment we may first ass qualitative factor to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of reporting unit exceeds it estimated fair value during qualitative analysis we consider the impact of change if any to the following factor macroeconomic industry and market factor cost factor change in overall financial performance and any other relevant event and uncertainty impacting reporting unit if our qualitative assessment indicates goodwill impairment is more likely than not we perform additional quantitative analysis we may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing for reporting unit where quantitative analysis is performed we perform test measuring the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing them to their carrying value including goodwill if the fair value is le than the carrying value of the reporting unit an impairment is recognized for the difference up to the carrying amount of goodwill of contentswe estimate the fair value of our reporting unit using discounted cash flow method which includes assumption about wide variety of internal and external factor significant assumption used in the discounted cash flow method include financial projection of free cash flow including revenue trend medical cost trend operating productivity income tax and capital level long term growth rate for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted period and discount rate for each reporting unit comparative market multiple are used to corroborate the result of our discounted cash flow test financial projection and long term growth rate used for our reporting unit are consistent with and use input from our internal long term business plan and strategy discount rate are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecast our most significant estimate in the discount rate determination involves our adjustment to the peer company weighted average cost of capital reflecting reporting unit specific factor we have not made any adjustment to decrease discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit company specific adjustment to discount rate are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty the passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding area of uncertainty with respect to the reporting unit operation could cause these assumption to change in the future additionally part of our quantitative impairment testing we perform various sensitivity analysis on certain key assumption such discount rate and cash flow projection to analyze the potential for material impact of october we completed our annual impairment test for

available observable market information for security not actively traded the pricing service may use quoted market price of comparable instrument or discounted cash flow analysis incorporating input currently observable in the market for similar security input often used in the valuation methodology include but are not limited to benchmark yield credit spread default rate prepayment speed and

reasonable estimate of fair value specifically the company compare the price received from the pricing service to price reported by secondary pricing source such it custodian it investment consultant and third party investment advisor additionally the company compare change in the reported market value and return to relevant market index to test the reasonableness of the reported price the company internal price verification procedure and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing service have not historically resulted in adjustment to the price obtained from
