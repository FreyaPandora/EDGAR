power wide area network lte advanced technology that provides pathway to internet of thing and enables many comparable benefit like low power usage long battery life and low device cost competitionthe wireless telecommunication industry is highly competitive we are the third largest provider of postpaid service plan and the largest provider of prepaid service plan in the measured by customer our competitor include other national carrier such at inc at verizon communication inc verizon and sprint at and verizon are significantly larger than and enjoy greater resource and scale advantage compared to in addition our competitor include numerous smaller regional carrier existing mobile virtual network operator mvnos including tracfone wireless inc comcast corporation comcast and charter communication inc and future mvnos such altice usa inc many of which offer or plan to offer no contract postpaid and prepaid service plan competitor also include provider who offer similar communication service such voice messaging and data service using alternative technology or service competitive factor within the wireless telecommunication industry include pricing market saturation service and product offering customer experience network investment and quality development and deployment of technology availability of additional spectrum license and regulatory change competitor have shown willingness to use aggressive pricing source of differentiation other competitor have sought to add ancillary service like mobile video to enhance their offering taken together the competitive factor we face continue to put pressure on growth and margin company compete to retain the current customer base and continue to add new customer employeesas of december we employed approximately full time and part time employee including network retail administrative and customer support function regulation the fcc regulates many key aspect of our business including licensing construction the operation and use of our network modification of our network control and ownership of our license and authorization the sale transfer and acquisition of certain license domestic roaming arrangement and interconnection agreement pursuant to it authority under the communication act of amended communication act the fcc ha number of complex requirement and proceeding that affect our operation and that could increase our cost or diminish our revenue for example the fcc ha rule regarding provision of and service porting telephone number interconnection roaming internet openness or net neutrality disability access privacy and cybersecurity consumer protection and the universal service and lifeline program many of these and other issue are being considered in ongoing proceeding and we can not predict whether or such action will affect our business financial condition or result of operation our ability to provide service and generate revenue could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or change to existing law and regulation in addition regulation of company that offer competing service can impact our business indirectly wireless communication provider must be licensed by the fcc to provide communication service at specified spectrum frequency within specified geographic area and must comply with the rule and policy governing the use of the spectrum of contentsadopted by the fcc the fcc issue each license for fixed period of time typically year depending on the particular license the fcc ha generally renewed license given to operating company like the fcc ha authority to both revoke license for cause and to deny license renewal if renewal is not in the public interest furthermore we could be subject to fine forfeiture and other penalty for failure to comply with fcc regulation even if any such non compliance wa unintentional in extreme case penalty can include revocation of our license the loss of any license or any related fine or forfeiture could adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition additionally congress and the fcc allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service cmrs which includes cellular pc miscellaneous wireless service and specialized mobile radio could significantly increase competition we can not ass the impact that any development that may occur in the economy or any future spectrum allocation by the fcc may have on license value fcc spectrum auction and other market development may adversely affect the market value of our license in the future significant decline in the value of our license could adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation in addition the fcc periodically review it policy on how to evaluate carrier spectrum holding change in these policy could affect spectrum resource and competition among and other carrier congress and the fcc have imposed limitation on foreign ownership of cmrs licensee that exceed direct ownership or indirect ownership the fcc ha ruled that higher level of indirect foreign ownership even up to are presumptively consistent with the public interest albeit subject to review consistent with that established policy the fcc ha issued declaratory ruling authorizing up to ownership of our company by dt this declaratory ruling and our license are conditioned on dt and the company compliance with network security agreement with the department of justice the federal bureau of investigation and the department of homeland security failure to comply with the term of this agreement could result in fine injunction and other penalty including potential revocation of our spectrum license while the communication act generally preempt state and local government from regulating the entry of or the rate charged by wireless communication provider certain state and local government regulate other term and condition of wireless service including billing termination of service arrangement and the imposition of early termination fee advertising network outage the use of device while driving zoning and land use additionally after the fcc adoption of the restoring internet freedom order number of state have sought to impose state specific net neutrality and privacy requirement on provider broadband service the fcc ruling broadly preempt such state effort which are inconsistent with the fcc federal deregulatory approach and there are pending court challenge that will determine if such state enactment are lawful while most state are largely seeking to codify the repealed federal rule there are difference in some state notably california which ha passed separate privacy and net neutrality legislation there are effort on the hill to push for federal legislation to codify uniform federal privacy and net neutrality requirement while also ensuring the preemption of separate state requirement including the california law if not rescinded separate state requirement will impose significant business cost and could also result in increased litigation cost and enforcement risk state authority over wireless broadband service will remain unsettled until final action by the court or congress in addition the federal trade commission ftc and other federal agency have jurisdiction over some consumer protection and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practice with respect to the provision of non common carrier service further the fcc and the federal aviation administration regulate the siting lighting and construction of transmitter tower and antenna tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning well federal statute regarding environmental and historic preservation the future cost to comply with all relevant regulation are to some extent unknown and change to regulation or the applicability of regulation could result in higher operating and capital expense or reduced

mobile com the information on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with or furnish to the sec of contentsitem risk factor in addition to the other information contained in this form the following risk factor should be considered carefully in evaluating our company our business financial condition liquidity or operating result well the price of our common stock and other security could be materially adversely affected by any of these risk risk related to our business and the wireless industrycompetition industry consolidation and change in the market for wireless service could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain customer and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result we have multiple wireless competitor some of which have greater resource than and compete for customer based principally on service device offering price network coverage speed and quality and customer service we expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industry customer growth rate to be moderate in comparison with historical growth rate or possibly negative leading to ongoing competition for customer we also expect that our customer appetite for data service will place increasing demand on our network capacity this competition and our capacity will continue to put pressure on pricing and margin company compete for potential customer our ability to compete will depend on among other thing continued absolute and relative improvement in network quality and customer service effective marketing and selling of product and service innovation attractive pricing and cost management all of which will involve significant expense joint venture merger acquisition and strategic alliance in the wireless sector have resulted in and are expected to result in larger competitor competing for limited number of customer the two largest national wireless communication provider currently serve significant percentage of all wireless customer and hold significant spectrum and other resource our largest competitor may be able to enter into exclusive handset device or content arrangement execute pervasive advertising and marketing campaign or otherwise improve their cost position relative to in addition refusal of our large competitor to provide critical access to resource and input such roaming service on reasonable term could improve their position within the wireless broadband mobile service industry we face intense and increasing competition from other service provider industry sector converge such cable telecom service and content satellite and other service provider company like comcast and at with acquisition of directv and time warner inc will have the scale and asset to aggressively compete in converging industry verizon through it acquisition of aol inc and yahoo inc is also significant competitor focusing on premium content offering to diversify outside of core wireless further some of our competitor now provide content service in addition to voice and broadband service and consumer are increasingly accessing video content from internet based provider and application all of which create increased competition in this area these factor together with the effect of the increasing aggregate penetration of wireless service in all metropolitan area and the ability of our larger competitor to use resource to build out their network and to quickly deploy advanced technology such could make it more difficult for to continue to attract and retain customer and may adversely affect our competitive position and ability to grow which would have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result the scarcity and cost of additional wireless spectrum and regulation relating to spectrum use may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result we will need to acquire additional spectrum in order to continue our customer growth expand and deepen our coverage maintain our quality of service meet increasing customer demand and deploy new technology we will be at competitive disadvantage and possibly experience erosion in the quality of service in certain market if we fail to gain access to necessary spectrum reaching network capacity result we are actively seeking to make additional investment in spectrum which could be significant the continued interest in and acquisition of spectrum by existing carrier and others may reduce our ability to acquire and or increase the cost of acquiring spectrum in the secondary market or negatively impact our ability to gain access to spectrum through other mean including government auction we may need to enter into spectrum sharing or leasing arrangement which are subject to certain risk and uncertainty and may involve significant expenditure gaining access to the spectrum we in the fcc mhz auction in may take up to three year or more any material delay could adversely impact our ability to implement our plan and effort to improve our network in addition our return on investment in spectrum depends on our ability to attract additional customer and to provide additional service and usage to existing customer result the return on any investment in spectrum that we make may not be much we anticipate or take longer than of contentsexpected additionally we may be unable to secure the spectrum we need in any auction we may elect to participate in or in the secondary market on favorable term or at all the fcc may impose condition on the use of new wireless broadband mobile spectrum that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configuration or coverage area additional condition that may be imposed by the fcc include heightened build out requirement limited license term or renewal right and clearing obligation that may make it le attractive or le economical to acquire spectrum in addition rule may be established for future government spectrum auction that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configuration or coverage area if we can not acquire needed spectrum from the government or otherwise if competitor acquire spectrum that will allow them to provide service competitive with our service or if we can not deploy service over acquired spectrum on timely basis without burdensome condition at reasonable cost and while maintaining network quality level our ability to attract and retain customer and our business financial condition and operating result could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to take advantage of technological development on timely basis we may experience decline in demand for our service or face challenge in implementing or evolving our business strategy significant technological change continue to impact the communication industry in general these technological change enhance communication and enable broader array of company to offer service competitive with ours in order to grow and remain competitive with new and evolving technology in our industry we will need to adapt to future change in technology continually invest in our network increase network capacity enhance our existing offering and introduce new offering to address our current and potential customer changing demand enhancing our network such deploying is subject to risk from equipment change and migration of customer from existing spectrum band and the potential inability to secure spectrum necessary to deploy advanced technology adopting new and sophisticated technology may result in implementation issue such scheduling and supplier delay unexpected or increased cost technological constraint regulatory permitting issue customer dissatisfaction and other issue that could cause delay in launching new technological capability which in turn could result in significant cost or reduce the anticipated benefit of the upgrade in general the development of new service in the wireless telecommunication industry will require to anticipate and respond to the continuously changing demand of our customer which we may not be able to do accurately or timely if our new service fail to retain or gain acceptance in the marketplace or if cost associated with these service are higher than anticipated this could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result we could be harmed by data loss or other security breach whether directly or

we expect to continue to be the target of cyber attack data breach or security incident which may in the future have material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition and operating result cyber attack such denial of service and other malicious attack could disrupt our internal system and application impair our ability to provide service to our customer and have other adverse effect on our business and that of others who depend on our service telecommunication carrier we are considered critical infrastructure provider and therefore may be more likely to be the target of such attack such attack company may be perpetrated by variety of group or person including those in jurisdiction where law enforcement measure to address such attack are ineffective or

repurchasing or issuing security making capital expenditure and incurring indebtedness in each case subject to certain exception these restriction may have significant negative impact on our business result of operation and financial condition management and financial resource have been diverted and will continue to be diverted toward the completion of the transaction we have incurred and expect to incur significant cost expense and fee for professional service and other transaction cost in connection with the transaction these cost could adversely affect our or the combined company financial condition and result of operation in addition we and our affiliate are involved in various dispute governmental and or regulatory inspection investigation and proceeding and litigation matter that arise from time to time and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of these matter could adversely affect and our result of operation financial condition and cash flow and the result of operation financial condition and cash flow of the combined company the business combination agreement contains provision that restrict the ability of our board to pursue alternative to the transaction the business combination agreement contains non solicitation provision that restrict our ability to solicit initiate knowingly encourage or knowingly take any other action designed to

director and officer may have interest in the transaction different from the interest of our stockholder certain of our director and executive officer negotiated the term of the business combination agreement our director and executive officer may have interest in the transaction that are different from or in addition to those of our stockholder these interest include but are not limited to the continued service of certain of our director director of the combined company the continued employment of certain of our executive officer by the combined company severance agreement and amended employment term and other right held by our director and executive officer and provision in the business combination agreement regarding continued indemnification of and advancement of expense to our director and officer risk related to integration and the combined companyalthough we expect that the transaction will result in synergy and other benefit those synergy and benefit may not be realized or may not be realized within the expected time frame our ability to realize the anticipated benefit of the transaction will depend to large extent on the combined company ability to integrate our and sprint business in manner that facilitates growth opportunity and achieves the projected standalone cost saving and revenue growth trend identified by each company without adversely affecting current revenue and investment in future growth in addition some of the anticipated synergy are not expected to occur for significant time period following the completion of the transaction and will require substantial capital expenditure in the near term to be fully realized even if the combined company is able to integrate the two company successfully the anticipated benefit of the transaction including the expected synergy and network benefit may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected our business and sprint business may not be integrated successfully or such integration may be more difficult time consuming or costly than expected operating cost customer loss and business disruption including difficulty in maintaining relationship with employee customer supplier or vendor may be greater than expected following the transaction revenue following the transaction may be lower than expected the combination of two independent business is complex costly and time consuming and may divert significant management attention and resource to combining our and sprint business practice and operation this process may disrupt of contentsour business the failure to meet the challenge involved in combining the two business and to realize the anticipated benefit of the transaction could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activity of the combined company and could adversely affect the result of operation of the combined company the overall combination of our and sprint business may also result in material unanticipated problem expense liability competitive response and loss of customer and other business relationship the difficulty of combining the operation of the company include among others the diversion of management attention to integration matter difficulty in integrating operation and system including intellectual property and communication system administrative and information technology infrastructure and financial reporting and internal control system challenge in conforming standard control procedure and accounting and other policy business culture and compensation structure between the two company difference in control environment culture and auditor expectation may result in future weakness and deficiency while we work to integrate the company and align guideline and practice alignment of key performance measurement may result in greater need to communicate and manage clear expectation while we work to integrate the company and align guideline and practice difficulty in integrating employee and attracting and retaining key personnel challenge in retaining existing customer and obtaining new customer difficulty in achieving anticipated cost saving synergy accretion target business opportunity financing plan and growth prospect from the combination difficulty in managing the expanded operation of significantly larger and more complex company the impact of the additional debt financing expected to be incurred in connection with the transaction the transition of management to the combined company management team and the need to address possible difference in corporate culture and management philosophy contingent liability that are larger than expected and potential unknown liability adverse consequence and unforeseen increased expense associated with the transaction some of these factor are outside of our control and or will be outside the control of the combined company and any one of them could result in lower revenue higher cost and diversion of management time and energy which could materially impact the business financial condition and result of operation of the combined company in addition even if the operation of our and sprint business are integrated successfully the full benefit of the merger may not be realized including among others the synergy cost saving or sale or growth opportunity that are expected these benefit may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all further additional unanticipated cost may be incurred in the integration of our and sprint business all of these factor could cause dilution to the earnings per share of the combined company decrease or delay the projected accretive effect of the merger and negatively impact the price of our common stock following the merger result it can not be assured that the combination of mobile and sprint will result in the realization of the full benefit expected from the transaction within the anticipated time frame or at all the indebtedness of the combined company following the completion of the transaction will be substantially greater than the indebtedness of each of mobile and sprint on standalone basis prior to the execution of the business combination agreement this increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect the combined company business flexibility and increase it borrowing cost in connection with the transaction we and sprint have conducted and expect to conduct certain pre merger financing transaction which will be used in part to prepay portion of our and sprint existing indebtedness and to fund liquidity need after giving effect to the pre merger financing transaction and the transaction we anticipate that the combined company will have consolidated indebtedness of up to approximately billion to billion based on estimated december debt and cash balance and excluding tower obligation our substantially increased indebtedness following the transaction will have the effect among other thing of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business economic market and industry condition and increasing the amount of cash required to meet interest payment in addition this increased level of indebtedness following the transaction may reduce fund available to support effort to combine our and sprint business and realize the expected benefit of the transaction and may also reduce fund available for capital expenditure share repurchase and other activity that may put the combined company at competitive disadvantage relative to other company with lower debt level further it may be necessary for the combined company to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future subject to the restriction contained in it debt instrument which could increase the risk associated with the capital structure of the combined company of contentsbecause of the substantial indebtedness of the combined company following the completion of the transaction there is risk that the combined company may not be able to service it debt obligation in accordance with their term the ability of the combined company to service it substantial debt obligation following the transaction will depend in part on future performance which will be affected by business economic market and industry condition and other factor including the ability of the combined company to achieve the expected benefit of the transaction there is no guarantee that the combined company will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service it debt obligation when due if the combined company is unable to meet such obligation or fails to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenant contained in the agreement governing such debt obligation it may be required to refinance all or part of it debt sell important strategic asset at unfavorable price or make additional borrowing the combined company may not be able to at any given time refinance it debt sell asset or make additional borrowing on commercially reasonable term or at all which could have material adverse effect on it business financial condition and result of operation after the transaction some or all of the combined company variable rate indebtedness may use the libor benchmark for establishing the rate libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposal for reform these reform and other pressure may cause libor to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past the consequence of these development can not be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness in addition any hedging agreement we have and may continue to enter into to limit our exposure to interest rate increase or foreign currency fluctuation may not offer complete protection from these risk or may be unsuccessful and consequently may effectively increase the interest rate we pay on our debt or the exchange rate with respect to such debt and any portion not subject to such hedging agreement would have full exposure to interest rate increase or foreign currency fluctuation applicable if any financial institution that are party to our hedging agreement were to default on their payment obligation to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent we would be unhedged against the underlying exposure any of these risk could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result the agreement governing the combined company indebtedness and other financing will include restrictive covenant that limit the combined company operating flexibility the agreement governing the combined company indebtedness and other financing will impose material operating and financial restriction on the combined company these restriction subject in certain case to customary basket exception and maintenance and incurrence based financial test may limit the combined company ability to engage in transaction and pursue strategic business opportunity including the following incurring additional indebtedness and issuing preferred stock paying dividend redeeming capital stock or making other restricted payment or investment selling or buying asset property or license developing asset property or license which the combined company ha or in the future may procure creating lien on asset securing indebtedness or other obligation participating in future fcc auction of spectrum or private sale of spectrum engaging in merger acquisition business combination or other transaction entering into transaction with affiliate and placing restriction on the ability of subsidiary to pay dividend or make other payment these restriction could limit the combined company ability to obtain debt financing make share repurchase refinance or pay principal on it outstanding indebtedness complete acquisition for cash or indebtedness or react to business economic market and industry condition and other change in it operating environment or the economy any future indebtedness that the combined company incurs may contain similar or more restrictive covenant any failure to comply with the restriction of the combined company debt agreement may result in an event of default under these agreement which in turn may result in default or acceleration of obligation under these and other agreement giving the combined company lender the right to terminate any commitment they had made to provide it with further fund and to require the combined company to repay all amount then outstanding the financing of the transaction is not assured although we have received debt financing commitment from lender to provide various financing arrangement to facilitate the transaction the obligation of the lender to provide these facility is subject to number of condition and the financing of the transaction may not be obtained on the expected term or at all of contentsin particular we have received commitment for billion in debt financing to fund the transaction which is comprised of billion secured revolving credit facility ii billion term loan credit facility and iii billion secured bridge loan facility our reliance on the financing from the billion secured bridge loan facility commitment is intended to be reduced through one or more secured note offering or other long term financing prior to the merger closing however there can be no assurance that we will be able to issue any such secured note or other long term financing on term we find acceptable or at all especially in light of the recent debt market volatility in which case we may have to exercise some or all of the commitment under the secured bridge facility to fund the transaction accordingly the cost of financing for the transaction may be higher than expected credit rating downgrade could adversely affect the business cash flow financial condition and operating result of mobile and following the transaction the combined company credit rating impact the cost and availability of future borrowing and result cost of capital our current rating reflect each rating agency opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligation or following the completion of the transaction obligation to the combined company obligors each rating agency review these rating periodically and

accounting policy of the note to the consolidated financial statement for further information seven of these policy below are critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgment about matter that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amount would be reported under different condition or using different assumption or input actual result could differ from those estimate management and the audit committee of the board of director have reviewed and approved these critical accounting policy revenue recognitionwe primarily generate our revenue from providing wireless service to customer and selling or leasing device and accessory our contract with customer may involve multiple performance obligation which include wireless service wireless device or combination thereof and we allocate the transaction price between each performance obligation based on it relative standalone selling price significant judgmentsthe most significant judgment affecting the amount and timing of revenue from contract with our customer include the following item revenue for service contract that we ass are not probable of collection is not recognized until the contract is completed and cash is received collectibility is re assessed when there is significant change in fact or circumstance our assessment of collectibility considers whether we may limit our exposure to credit risk through our right to stop transferring additional service in the event the customer is delinquent well certain contract term such down payment that reduce our exposure to credit risk customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain see allowance below for more discussion on how we ass credit risk promotional eip bill credit offered to customer on an equipment sale that are paid over time and are contingent on the customer maintaining service contract may result in an extended service contract based on whether substantive penalty is deemed to exist determining whether contingent eip bill credit result in substantive termination penalty may require significant judgment the identification of distinct performance obligation within our service plan may require significant judgment revenue is recorded net of cost paid to another party for performance obligation where we arrange for the other party to transfer good or service to the customer when we are acting an agent for example performance obligation relating to service provided by third party content provider where we neither control right to the content provider service control the underlying service are presented net because we are acting an agent the determination of whether we control the underlying service or right to the service prior to our transfer to the customer requires at time significant judgment for transaction where we recognize significant financing component judgment is required to determine the discount rate for eip sale the discount rate used to adjust the transaction price primarily reflects current market interest rate and the estimated credit risk of the customer customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain see allowance below for more discussion on how we ass credit risk our product are generally sold with right of return which is accounted for variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize device return level are estimated based on the expected value method there are large number of contract with similar characteristic and the outcome of each contract is independent of the others historical return rate experience is significant input to our expected value methodology sale of equipment to indirect dealer who have been identified our customer referred to the sell in model often include credit subsequently paid to the dealer reimbursement for any discount promotion offered to the end consumer these credit payment to customer are accounted for variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize from the sale of equipment to indirect dealer and are estimated based on historical experience and other factor such expected promotional activity the determination of the standalone selling price for contract that involve more than one performance obligation may require significant judgment such when the selling price of good or service is not readily observable for capitalized contract cost determining the amortization period over which such cost are recognized well assessing the indicator of impairment may require significant judgment of contentsallowanceswe maintain an allowance for credit loss which is management estimate of such loss inherent in our receivables portfolio comprised of account receivable and eip receivable segment change in the allowance for credit loss and therefore in related provision for credit loss bad debt expense can materially affect earnings credit risk characteristic are assessed for each receivable segment in applying the judgment and review required to determine the allowance for credit loss management considers number of factor including receivable volume receivable delinquency status historical loss experience and other condition influencing loss expectation such macro economic condition while our methodology attribute portion of the allowance to specific portfolio segment the entire allowance for credit loss is available to absorb credit loss inherent in the total receivables portfolio management also considers an amount that represents management judgment of risk inherent in the process and assumption used in establishing the allowance for credit loss including process risk and other subjective factor including industry trend and emerging risk assessment to the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trend or assumption the appropriate allowance level for realized credit loss could differ from the estimate we write off account balance if collection effort are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible based on customer credit rating and the length of time from the original billing date we offer certain retail customer the option to pay for their device and other purchase in installment over period of up to month using an eip eip receivables not held for sale are reported in our consolidated balance sheet at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge offs allowance for credit loss and unamortized discount receivables held for sale are reported at the lower of amortized cost or fair value at the time of an installment sale we impute discount for interest if the eip term exceeds month there is no stated rate of interest on the eip receivables the eip receivables are recorded at their present value which is determined by discounting future cash payment at the imputed interest rate the difference between the recorded amount of the eip receivables and their unpaid principal balance the contractual amount due from the customer result in discount which is recorded reduction in transaction price and allocated to the performance obligation of the arrangement we determine the imputed discount rate based primarily on current market interest rate and the estimated credit risk on the eip receivables result we do not recognize separate credit loss allowance at the time of issuance the effect of uncertainty about future cash flow resulting from credit risk are included in the initial present value measurement of the receivable the imputed discount on eip receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized other revenue in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount we ass the need for and if necessary recognize an allowance for credit loss to the extent the amount of estimated probable loss on the gross eip receivable balance exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balance total imputed discount and allowance wa approximately of the total amount of gross account receivable including eip receivables at both december and deferred purchase price assetsin connection with the sale of certain service and eip account receivable pursuant to the sale arrangement we have deferred purchase price asset measured at fair value that are based on discounted cash flow model using unobservable level input including customer default rate and credit worthiness dilution and recovery see note sale of certain receivables for further

leased wireless device are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to which is generally shorter than the lease term and considers expected loss depreciable life study are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable life for certain category of property plant and equipment these study consider actual usage physical wear and tear replacement history and assumption about technology evolution when these factor indicate that the useful life of an asset is different from the previous assessment the remaining book value are depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful of contentslife see note summary of significant accounting policy and note property and equipment of the note to the consolidated financial statement for information regarding depreciation of asset including management underlying estimate of useful life evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment we ass the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset such our spectrum license for potential impairment annually of december or more frequently if event or change in circumstance indicate such asset might be impaired when assessing goodwill for impairment we may elect to first perform qualitative assessment for reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary if we do not perform qualitative assessment or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is le than it carrying amount we perform quantitative test we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit fair value however the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using market approach which is based on market capitalization we recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor change in market capitalization to determine whether decline if any necessitate an interim impairment review in the event market capitalization doe decline below it book value we will consider the length severity and reason for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists including considering whether control premium should be added to the market capitalization we believe short term fluctuation in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value we test spectrum license for impairment on an aggregate basis consistent with our management of the overall business at national level we may elect to first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is le than it carrying value if we do not perform the qualitative assessment or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset is le than it carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset if the estimated fair value of the spectrum license is lower than their carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized we estimate fair value using the greenfield methodology which is an income approach to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participant at the measurement date under current market condition the greenfield methodology value the spectrum license by calculating the cash flow generating potential of hypothetical start up company that go into business with no asset except the asset to be valued in this case spectrum license the value of the spectrum license can be considered equal to the present value of the cash flow of this hypothetical start up company we base the assumption underlying the greenfield methodology on combination of market participant data and our historical result trend and business plan future cash flow in the greenfield methodology are based on estimate and assumption of market participant revenue ebitda margin network build out period and long term growth rate for market participant the cash flow are discounted using weighted average cost of capital the valuation approach utilized to estimate fair value for the purpose of the impairment test of goodwill and spectrum license require the use of assumption and estimate which involve degree of uncertainty if actual result or future expectation are not consistent with the assumption this may result in the recording of significant impairment charge on goodwill or spectrum license the most significant assumption within the valuation model are the discount rate revenue ebitda margin capital expenditure and the long term growth rate see note summary of significant accounting policy and note goodwill spectrum license and other intangible asset of the note to the

or more frequently if event or change in circumstance indicate such asset might be impaired when assessing goodwill for impairment we may elect to first perform qualitative assessment for reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary if we do not perform qualitative assessment or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the two reporting unit wireless business and tv is le than it carrying amount we perform quantitative test we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit fair value however the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit we test our spectrum license for impairment on an aggregate basis consistent with our management of the overall business at national level we may elect to first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is le than it carrying value if we do not perform the qualitative assessment or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is le than it carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset if the estimated fair value of the spectrum license is lower than their carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized for the difference we estimate fair value using the greenfield methodology which is an income approach to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participant at the measurement date under current market condition guarantee liabilitieswe offer device trade in program just upgrade my phone jump which provides eligible customer specified price trade in right to upgrade their device upon enrollment participating customer must finance the purchase of device on an eip and have qualifying mobile monthly wireless service plan which is treated single multiple element arrangement when entered into at or near the same time upon qualifying jump program upgrade the customer remaining eip balance is settled provided they trade in their eligible used device in good working condition and purchase new device from on new eip for customer who enroll in jump we recognize liability and reduce revenue for the portion of revenue which represents the estimated fair value of the specified price trade in right guarantee the guarantee liability is valued based on various economic and customer behavioral assumption which requires judgment including estimating the customer remaining eip balance at trade in the expected fair value of the used device at trade in and the probability and timing of trade in when customer upgrade their device the difference between the eip balance credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned device is recorded against the guarantee liability all assumption are reviewed periodically for note to the consolidated financial statementsfair value measurementswe carry certain asset and liability at fair value fair value is defined an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date the three tier hierarchy for input used in measuring fair value which prioritizes the input based on the observability of the measurement date is follows level price in active market for identical asset or liability level input other than the quoted price in active market for identical asset and liability andlevel input for which there is little or no market data which require to develop assumption of what market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability asset and liability are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement our assessment of the significance of particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of asset and liability being measured within the fair value hierarchy the carrying value of cash and cash equivalent short term investment account receivable account receivable from affiliate and account payable approximate fair value due to the short term maturity of these instrument the carrying value of eip receivables approximate fair value the receivables are recorded at their present value net of unamortized discount and allowance for credit loss there were no financial instrument with carrying value materially different from their fair value based on quoted market price or rate for the same or similar instrument or internal valuation model derivative financial instrumentsderivative financial instrument are recognized either asset or liability and are measured at fair value we do not use derivative for trading or speculative purpose for derivative instrument designated cash flow hedge change in fair value are reported component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci until reclassified into interest expense in the same period the hedged transaction affect earnings generally over the life of the related debt unrealized gain on derivative designated cash flow hedge are recorded at fair value asset and unrealized loss on derivative designated cash flow hedge are recorded at fair value liability we have embedded derivative for certain component of the reset feature of the senior reset note to affiliate which are required to be bifurcated and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value change in fair value are recognized in interest expense to affiliate in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income revenue recognition effective january we primarily generate our revenue from providing wireless service to customer and selling or leasing device and accessory our contract with customer may involve multiple performance obligation which include wireless service wireless device or combination thereof and we allocate the transaction price between each performance obligation based on it relative standalone selling price significant judgmentsthe most significant judgment affecting the amount and timing of revenue from contract with our customer include the following item revenue for service contract that we ass are not probable of collection is not recognized until the contract is completed and cash is received collectibility is re assessed when there is significant change in fact or circumstance our assessment of collectibility considers whether we may limit our exposure to credit risk through our right to stop transferring additional service in the event the customer is delinquent well certain contract term such down payment that reduce our exposure to credit risk customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain see receivables and allowance for credit loss above for more discussion on how we ass credit risk promotional eip bill credit offered to customer on an equipment sale that are paid over time and are contingent on the customer maintaining service contract may result in an extended service contract based on whether substantive penalty is deemed to exist determining whether contingent eip bill credit result in substantive termination penalty may require significant judgment for note to the consolidated financial statement the identification of distinct performance obligation within our service plan may require significant judgment revenue is recorded net of cost paid to another party for performance obligation where we arrange for the other party to transfer good or service to the customer when we are acting an agent for example performance obligation relating to service provided by third party content provider where we neither control right to the content provider service nor control the underlying service itself are presented net because we are acting an agent the determination of whether we control the underlying service or right to the service prior to our transfer to the customer requires at time significant judgment for transaction where we recognize significant financing component judgment is required to determine the discount rate for eip sale the discount rate used to adjust the transaction price primarily reflects current market interest rate and the estimated credit risk of the customer customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain see receivables and allowance for credit loss above for more discussion on how we ass credit risk our product are generally sold with right of return which is accounted for variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize device return level are estimated based on the expected value method there are large number of contract with similar characteristic and the outcome of each contract is independent of the others historical return rate experience is significant input to our expected value methodology sale of equipment to indirect dealer who have been identified our customer referred to the sell in model often include credit subsequently paid to the dealer reimbursement for any discount promotion offered to the end consumer these credit payment to customer are accounted for variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize from the sale of equipment to indirect dealer and are estimated based on historical experience and other factor such expected promotional activity the determination of the standalone selling price for contract that involve more than one performance obligation may require significant judgment such when the selling price of good or service is not readily observable for capitalized contract cost determining the amortization period over which such cost are recognized well assessing the indicator of impairment may require significant judgment wireless service revenuewe generate our wireless service revenue from providing access to and usage of our wireless communication network service revenue also include revenue earned for providing value added service to customer such handset insurance service service contract are billed monthly either in advance or arrears or are prepaid generally service revenue is recognized we satisfy our performance obligation to transfer service to our customer we typically satisfy our stand ready performance obligation including unlimited wireless service evenly over the contract term for usage based and prepaid wireless service we satisfy our performance obligation when service are rendered revenue for service contract that we ass are not probable of collection is not recognized until the contract is completed and cash is received collectibility is re assessed when there is significant change in fact or circumstance our assessment of collectibility considers whether we may limit our exposure to credit risk through our right to stop transferring additional service in the event the customer is delinquent consideration payable to customer is treated reduction of the total transaction price unless the payment is in exchange for distinct good or service such certain commission paid to dealer revenue is recorded net of cost paid to another party for performance obligation where we arrange for the other party to transfer good or service to the customer when we are acting an agent for example performance obligation relating to service provided by third party content provider where we neither control right to the content provider service nor control the underlying service itself are presented net because we are acting an agent federal universal service fund usf and other regulatory fee are assessed by various governmental authority in connection with the service we provide to our customer and are included in cost of service when we separately bill and collect these regulatory fee from customer they are recorded gross in total service revenue in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended december and we recorded approximately million million and million respectively of usf fee on gross basis we have made an accounting policy election to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all tax assessed by governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue producing transaction and collected by from customer for example sale use value added and some excise tax for note to the consolidated financial statementsequipment revenueswe generate equipment revenue from the sale or lease of mobile communication device and accessory for performance obligation related to equipment contract we typically transfer control at point in time when the device or accessory is delivered to and accepted by the customer or dealer we have elected to account for shipping and handling activity that occur after control of the related good transfer fulfillment activity instead of assessing such activity performance obligation we estimate variable consideration device return or certain payment to indirect dealer primarily based on historical experience equipment sale not probable of collection are generally recorded payment are received our assessment of collectibility considers contract term such down payment that reduce our exposure to credit risk we offer certain customer the option to pay for device and accessory in installment using an eip generally we recognize reduction of the total transaction price the effect of financing component in contract where customer purchase their device and accessory on an eip with term of more than one year including those financing component that are not considered to be significant to the contract however we have elected the practical expedient to not recognize the effect of significant financing component for contract where we expect at contract inception that the period between the transfer of performance obligation to customer and the customer payment for that performance obligation will be one year or le in addition for customer who enroll in our jump program we recognize liability based on the estimated fair value of the specified price trade in right guarantee the fair value of the guarantee is deducted from the transaction price and the remaining transaction price is allocated to other element of the contract including service and equipment performance obligation see guarantee liability above for further information jump on demand allows customer to lease device over period of up to month and upgrade it for new device up to one time per month to date all of our leased wireless device are accounted for operating lease and estimated contract consideration is allocated between lease element and non lease element such service and equipment performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation in the contract lease revenue are recorded equipment revenue and recognized earned on straight line basis over the lease term lease revenue on contract not probable of collection are limited to the amount of payment received see property and equipment above for further information contract balancesgenerally our device and service plan are available at standard price which are maintained on price list and published on our website and or within our retail store for contract that involve more than one product or service that are identified separate performance obligation the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligation based on their relative standalone selling price the standalone selling price is the price at which we would sell the good or service separately to customer and is most commonly evidenced by the price at which we sell that good or service separately in similar circumstance and to similar customer contract asset is recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of our right to receive consideration we must perform additional service in order to receive consideration amount are recorded receivables when our right to consideration is unconditional when consideration is received or we have an unconditional right to consideration in advance of delivery of good or service contract liability is recorded the transaction price can include non refundable upfront fee which are allocated to the identifiable performance obligation contract asset are included in other current asset and other asset and contract liability are included in deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet contract modificationsour service contract allow customer to frequently modify their contract without incurring penalty in many case each time contract is modified we evaluate the change in scope or price of the contract to determine if the modification should be treated separate contract if there is termination of the existing contract and creation of new contract or if the modification should be considered change associated with the existing contract we typically do not have significant impact from contract modification for note to the consolidated financial statementscontract costswe incur certain incremental cost to obtain contract that we expect to recover such sale commission we record an asset when these incremental cost to obtain contract are incurred and amortize them on systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the good or service to which the asset relates we amortize deferred cost incurred to obtain service contract on straight line basis over the term of the initial contract and anticipated renewal contract to which the cost relate currently month however we have elected the practical expedient permitting expensing of cost to obtain contract when the expected amortization period is one year or le incremental cost to obtain equipment contract commission paid on device and accessory sale are recognized when the equipment is transferred to the customer see note summary of significant accounting policy included in our annual report on form for the year ended december for more discussion regarding the accounting policy that governed revenue recognition prior to january rent expensewe have operating lease for cell site retail location corporate office and dedicated transportation line some of which have escalating rental during the initial lease term and during subsequent optional renewal period we recognize rent expense on straight line basis over the non cancelable lease term and renewal period that are considered reasonably assured at the inception of the lease we consider several factor in assessing whether renewal period are reasonably assured of being exercised including the continued maturation of our network nationwide technological advance within the telecommunication industry and the availability of alternative site advertising expensewe expense the cost of advertising and other promotional expenditure to market our service and product incurred for the year ended december and advertising expense included in selling general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income were billion billion and billion respectively income taxesdeferred tax asset and liability

valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of deferred tax asset will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction within the carryforward period available we account for uncertainty in income tax recognized in the financial statement in accordance with the accounting guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return we

decision relating to the entity operation through voting right do not have the obligation to absorb the expected loss or do not have the right to receive the residual return of the entity the most common type of vie is special purpose entity spe spes are commonly used in securitization transaction in order to isolate certain asset and distribute the cash flow from those asset to investor spes are generally structured to insulate investor from claim on the spe asset by creditor of other entity including the creditor of the seller of the asset the primary beneficiary is required to

revenue standard requires entity to recognize revenue through the application of five step model which includes identification of the contract identification of the performance obligation determination of the transaction price allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation and recognition of revenue the entity satisfies the performance obligation we adopted the new revenue standard on january using the modified retrospective method with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application comparative information ha not been restated and continues to be reported under the standard in effect for those period we have applied the new revenue standard only to contract not completed of the date of initial application referred to open contract we have elected the practical expedient that permit an entity to reflect the aggregate effect of all of the modification on contract by contract basis that occurred before the date of initial application in determining the transaction price identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligation and allocating the transaction price to the performance obligation electing this practical expedient doe not have significant impact on our financial statement due to the short term duration of most of our contract and the nature of our contract modification we have implemented significant new revenue accounting system process and internal control over revenue recognition to assist in the application of the new revenue standard for note to the consolidated financial statementsfinancial statement impact of applying the new revenue standardthe cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard to all open contract of january is follows january in million beginning balance cumulative effect adjustment beginning balance adjustedassets other current asset and stockholder equity deferred revenue tax deficit the most significant impact upon adoption of the new revenue standard on january include the following item deferred contract cost asset of million wa recorded at transition in other asset in our consolidated balance sheet for incremental contract acquisition cost paid on open contract which consists primarily of commission paid to acquire branded postpaid service contract and contract asset of million wa recorded at transition in other current asset in our consolidated balance sheet primarily for contract with promotional bill credit offered to customer on equipment sale that are paid over time and

revenue standard new revenue standard changeassets other current asset and stockholder equity deferred revenue tax deficit most significant impact to financial statement result reported under the new revenue standard compared to the previous revenue standard for the current reporting period are follows under the new revenue standard certain commission paid to dealer previously recognized reduction to equipment revenue in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income are now recorded commission cost in selling general and administrative expense contract cost capitalized for new contract accumulated in other asset in our consolidated balance sheet during result there wa net benefit to operating income in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income during capitalization of cost exceeded amortization capitalized cost amortize into expense over time the accretive benefit to operating income is expected to moderate in and normalize in certain promotion previously recognized reduction in equipment revenue in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income are now recorded reduction in service revenue certain revenue previously recognized equipment revenue in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income are now recorded service revenue certain contract fulfillment cost have been reclassified to cost of service in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income from selling general and administrative expense wholesale revenue for minimum guaranteed amount guarantee shortfall are recognized when it is probable that reversal of such revenue will not occur which may impact the timing of recognition compared to the previous standard for contract with promotional bill credit that are contingent on the customer maintaining service contract that result in an extended service contract contract asset is recorded when control of the equipment transfer to the customer and is subsequently amortized reduction to total service revenue in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the extended contract term see disclosure related to contract with customer under the new revenue standard in note revenue from contract with customer statement of cash flowson january we adopted asu statement of cash flow topic classification of certain cash receipt and cash payment the new cash flow standard which impacted the presentation of our cash flow related to our beneficial interest in securitization transaction which is the deferred purchase price resulting in reclassification of cash inflow from operating activity to investing activity of approximately billion billion and billion for the year ended december and respectively in our consolidated statement of cash flow the new cash flow standard also impacted the presentation of our cash payment for debt prepayment and debt extinguishment cost resulting in reclassification of cash outflow from operating activity to financing activity of million and million for the year ended december and respectively in our consolidated statement of cash flow there were no cash payment for debt prepayment and debt extinguishment cost during the year ended december we have applied the new cash flow standard retrospectively to all period presented financial instrumentsin january the fasb issued asu financial instrument topic recognition and measurement of financial asset and financial liability and ha since modified the standard in february with asu for note to the consolidated financial statement technical correction and improvement to financial instrument overall subtopic recognition and measurement of financial asset and financial liability the standard address certain aspect of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instrument the standard became effective for and we adopted the standard on january the standard requires the impact of adoption to be recorded to retained earnings under modified retrospective approach resulting in reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive income to accumulated deficit of million income taxesin october the fasb issued asu accounting for income tax topic intra entity transfer of asset other than inventory the standard requires that the income tax impact of intra entity sale and transfer of property except for inventory be recognized when the transfer occurs the standard became effective for and we adopted the standard on january the standard requires any deferred tax not yet recognized on intra entity transfer to be recorded to retained earnings under modified retrospective approach resulting in an adjustment to accumulated deficit of million derivative and hedgingin august the fasb issued asu derivative and hedging topic targeted improvement to accounting for hedging activity the new derivative and hedging standard the standard modified the guidance for the designation and measurement of qualifying hedging relationship and the presentation of hedge result we adopted this standard on october and have applied the standard to hedging transaction prospectively accounting pronouncement not yet adoptedleasesin february the fasb issued asu lease topic and ha since modified the standard with several asus collectively the new lease standard the standard is effective for and we adopted the standard on january the new lease standard requires most lessee to report right of use asset and lease liability the income statement recognition is similar to existing lease accounting and is based on lease classification the new lease standard requires lessee and lessor to classify most lease using principle similar to existing lease accounting for lessor the new lease standard modifies the classification criterion and the accounting for sale type and direct financing lease the new lease standard provides entity two option for applying the modified retrospective approach either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented in the financial statement with the cumulative effect adjustment recognized at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented or retrospectively at the beginning of the period of adoption january through cumulative effect adjustment we plan to adopt the standard by recognizing and measuring lease at the adoption date with cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application the new standard provides for number of optional practical expedient in transition we do not expect to elect the package of practical expedient and result we would be required to reassess under the new standard our prior accounting conclusion about lease identification lease classification and initial direct cost we do expect to elect the use of hindsight for determining the reasonably certain lease term we do not expect to elect the practical expedient pertaining to land easement it is not applicable to upon the adoption of the new lease standard entity are required to reassess any previous failed sale leaseback transaction that remain failed of the effective date of the new standard this reassessment should consider if sale would have occurred of the beginning of the reporting period in which the entity applies the new lease standard under the new lease standard sale is assessed using the transfer of control criterion in the new revenue standard if the revised sale leaseback guidance criterion are met and sale ha occurred of the effective date the gain or loss on the sale of the underlying asset is recognized an adjustment to equity and the accounting for the leaseback will follow the transition provision provided for all other operating lease we expect the most significant judgment and impact upon adoption of the standard to include the following item upon adoption on january we will recognize right of use asset and lease liability that have not previously been recorded the lease liability for operating lease is based on the net present value of future minimum lease payment the right of use asset for operating lease is based on the lease liability adjusted for the reclassification of certain balance sheet amount such deferred rent subsequent to re measurement from the assessment of lease term for note to the consolidated financial statementsdescribed below and prepaid rent deferred and prepaid rent will not be presented separately after the adoption of the new lease standard we expect to elect the use of hindsight in determining the expected lease term for all cell site and have generally concluded to include only payment due for the initial non cancelable lease term this assessment of expected lease term corresponds to our lease term assessment for new lease and aligns with the payment that have been disclosed lease commitment in prior year result the average remaining lease term for cell site ha decreased from approximately year to year based on lease contract in effect at transition on january we are also required to reassess the previously failed sale leaseback of certain mobile owned wireless communication tower site and determine whether the transfer of the asset to the tower operator under the arrangement met the transfer of control criterion in the new revenue standard and whether sale should be recognized we are continuing to finalize our assessment of the previously failed sale leaseback if we conclude sale should be recognized upon adoption on january we would derecognize our existing long term financial obligation and the net book value of the tower related property and equipment associated with the previously failed sale leaseback transaction change in the sale leaseback accounting conclusion would also result in the recognition of lease liability and right of use asset for the leaseback decrease in other revenue and interest expense and reclassification of certain cash payment from financing outflow to operating outflow in our consolidated statement of cash flow excluding the impact of potential change in the accounting conclusion around the previously failed sale leaseback the cumulative effect of initially applying the new lease standard on january and for fiscal year would be follows the cumulative effect of initially applying the new lease standard on january is estimated to be an increase in total asset of billion to billion an increase in total liability of billion to billion and decrease to accumulated deficit of million to million the aggregate impact is expected to result in decrease in total operating expense of million to million and an increase to net income of million to million in fiscal year including the impact that would result from change in the accounting conclusion on the previously failed sale leaseback the cumulative effect of initially applying the new lease standard on january and for fiscal year would be follows the cumulative effect of initially applying the new lease standard on january is estimated to be an increase in total asset of billion to billion an increase in total liability of billion to billion and decrease to accumulated deficit of billion to billion the aggregate impact is expected to result in decrease in other revenue of million to million decrease in interest expense of million to million decrease in total operating expense of million to million and an increase to net income of million to million in fiscal year the expected impact on our consolidated statement of cash flow in fiscal year is decrease in net cash provided by operating activity of million to million and decrease in net cash used in financing activity of million to million the new lease standard provides practical expedient and policy election for an entity ongoing accounting we currently expect to elect the practical expedient to not separate lease and non lease component for all of our lease we do not expect to elect the short term lease recognition exemption which includes the recognition of right of use asset and lease liability for existing short term lease at transition for arrangement where we are the lessor we do not expect the adoption of the new lease standard to have material impact on our financial statement all of our lease are operating lease the new lease standard provides practical expedient for lessor in which the lessor may elect by class of underlying asset to not separate non lease component from the associated lease component and instead to account for these component single component if both of the following are met the timing and pattern of transfer of the non lease component and associated lease component are the same and the lease component if accounted for separately would be classified an operating lease we do not expect to elect this expedient for leased wireless device under our jump on demand program for note to the consolidated financial statementswe are in the process of implementing significant new lease accounting system and are updating process and implementing new internal control over lease recognition to assist in the application of the new lease standard financial instrumentsin june the fasb issued asu financial instrument credit loss topic measurement of credit loss on financial instrument in november the fasb issued asu codification improvement to topic financial instrument credit loss which amends the scope and transition requirement of asu the standard requires financial asset or group of financial asset measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected the measurement of expected credit loss is based on relevant information about past event including historical experience current condition and reasonable and supportable forecast that affect the collectibility of the reported amount the standard will become effective for beginning january and will require cumulative effect adjustment to accumulated deficit of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is
