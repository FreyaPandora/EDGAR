generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation cost if any of our government contract were to be terminated for default generally the government would pay for the work that ha been accepted and could require to pay the difference the original contract price and the cost to re procure the contract item net of the work accepted from

governing production and quality system airworthiness and installation approval repair procedure and continuing operational safety new aircraft model and new derivative aircraft are required to obtain faa certification prior to entry into service outside the similar requirement exist for airworthiness installation and operational approval these requirement are generally of contentsadministered by the national aviation authority of each country and in the case of europe coordinated by the european union aviation safety agency environmental we are subject to various federal state local and non law and regulation relating to environmental protection including the discharge treatment storage disposal and remediation of hazardous substance and waste we could also be affected by future law and regulation relating to climate change including law related to greenhouse gas emission these law and regulation could lead to increased environmental compliance expenditure increased energy and raw material cost and new and or additional investment in design and technology we continually ass our compliance status and management of environmental matter to ensure our operation are in compliance with all applicable environmental law and regulation investigation remediation and operation and maintenance cost associated with environmental compliance and management of site are normal recurring part of our operation these cost often are allowable cost under our contract with the government it is reasonably possible that cost incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have

corruption and repatriation of earnings non sale are also subject to varying currency political and economic risk raw material part and subassemblieswe are highly dependent on the availability of essential material part and subassemblies from our supplier and subcontractor the most important raw material required for our aerospace product are aluminum sheet plate forging and extrusion titanium sheet plate forging and extrusion and composite including carbon and boron although alternative source generally exist for these raw material qualification of the source could take year or more many major component and product equipment item are procured or subcontracted on sole source basis supplierswe are dependent upon the ability of large number of and non supplier and subcontractor to meet performance specification quality standard and delivery schedule at our anticipated cost while we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third party failure of supplier or subcontractor to meet commitment could adversely affect production schedule and program contract profitability thereby jeopardizing our ability

contained in this report risk related to covid face significant risk related to the spread of the covid virus and development surrounding the global pandemic have had and will continue to have significant effect on our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow we also face significant risk related to the global economic downturn and severe reduction in commercial air traffic caused by the pandemic these risk include materially reduced demand for our product and service increased instability in our operation and in our supply chain and challenge to the ongoing viability of of our customer in addition future vaccination mandate or other government requirement may disrupt our operation and those of our customer and supplier we may face similar risk in connection with any future public health crisis including resurgence in the spread of covid the covid pandemic ha subjected our business operation financial performance cash flow and financial condition to number of risk including but not limited to those discussed below operation related risk result of the covid pandemic we are facing increased operational challenge from the need to protect employee health and safety these challenge have included and may in the future include production site shutdown workplace disruption and restriction on the movement of people social distancing guideline increased employee absenteeism due to illness and or quarantine contact tracing requirement well reduced availability of raw material and good both at our own facility and those of our customer and supplier during the second quarter of we temporarily suspended operation in puget sound south carolina and philadelphia well at several other key production site we had not previously experienced complete suspension of our operation at these production site while we have resumed operation at all of our production site we can not predict whether or where further production disruption could be required or the ongoing impact of covid related operating restriction will be for example we continue to experience near term production disruption and inefficiency well additional operating cost due to social distancing requirement increased level of employee absenteeism and other factor related to covid restriction we can not predict the impact that future production disruption may have on our business operation financial performance and financial condition we continue to monitor federal state and municipal health authority for new or modified guidance and requirement concerning the covid pandemic and we may be required to impose additional operational restriction and or suspend operation at key production site based on these requirement and recommendation and or workplace disruption caused by covid if future vaccination mandate or other similar governmental requirement take effect or if covid case rate worsen at one or more of our production facility we may face further increase in employee absenteeism and or attrition any of which could cause operational disruption and otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation many of our supplier also were required to suspend operation during the second quarter of in we experienced part shortage which disrupted our operation and delayed delivery we may experience additional disruption and or part shortage in any such disruption could have severe adverse impact on our production cost delivery schedule and or ability to meet customer commitment of contentsfurther production disruption and inefficiency suspension of operation or delayed recovery in our operation and or any comparable impact involving one or more of our key supplier or the failure of any of our key supplier would result in further challenge to our business which could have further material adverse effect on our business financial position result of operation and or cash flow liquidity risk the covid pandemic ha also had significant impact on our liquidity and overall debt level during the year ended december net cash used by operating activity wa billion at december cash and short term investment totaled billion our debt balance totaled billion at december from billion at december we expect negative operating cash flow in future quarter delivery begin to return to historical level and if the pace and scope of the recovery are worse than we currently contemplate we may need to obtain additional financing in order to fund our operation and obligation if we were to need to obtain additional financing uncertainty related to covid and it impact on and the aerospace industry well continued uncertainty with respect to our credit rating could limit our access to credit market and we may have difficulty obtaining financing on term acceptable to or at all in addition certain of our customer may also be unable to make timely payment to factor that could limit our access to additional liquidity include further disruption in the global capital market and or additional decline in our financial performance outlook or credit rating the occurrence of any or all of these event could adversely affect our ability to fund our operation and or meet outstanding debt obligation and contractual commitment in addition further downgrade in our credit rating could adversely affect our cost of fund and related margin liquidity competitive position and access to capital market and significant downgrade could have an adverse impact on our business customer related risk commercial air traffic ha fallen dramatically due to the covid pandemic this trend ha impacted passenger traffic most severely most airline have significantly reduced their capacity and many could implement further reduction many airline are also implementing significant reduction in staffing these capacity change are causing and are expected to continue to cause negative impact to our customer revenue earnings and cash flow and in some case may threaten the future viability of some of our customer potentially causing default within our customer financing portfolio which wa billion of december and or requiring to remarket aircraft that have already been produced and or are currently in backlog if we are unable to successfully remarket these aircraft and or the narrow body and wide body market do not recover soon we are currently assuming or if we are required to further reduce production rate and or contract the accounting quantity on any of our commercial program we could experience material reduction in earnings and or be required to recognize reach forward loss on one or more of our program for example in the fourth quarter of we recognized reach forward loss on the program in part due to impact related to the covid pandemic additionally we may experience fewer new order and increased cancellation across all of our commercial airplane program result of the covid pandemic and associated impact on demand our customer may also lack sufficient liquidity to purchase new aircraft due to impact from the pandemic in addition to the near term impact there is risk that the industry implement longer term strategy involving reduced capacity shifting route pattern and mitigation strategy related to impact from covid and the risk of future public health crisis in addition airline may experience reduced demand due to reluctance by the flying public to travel result of travel restriction and or social distancing requirement result there is significant uncertainty with respect to whether and at what point commercial air traffic capacity will return to and or exceed pre covid level this uncertainty may have significant impact on the demand for both single aisle and wide body commercial aircraft well for the service we provide to commercial airline in addition lengthy period of reduced industry wide demand for commercial aircraft would put additional pressure on our supplier resulting in increased procurement cost and or additional supply chain disruption to the extent that the covid pandemic of contentsor it aftermath further impact demand for our product and service or impairs the viability of some of our customer and or supplier our financial position result of operation and or cash flow could be adversely affected and those impact could be material other risk the magnitude and duration of the global covid pandemic is uncertain and continues to adversely affect our business and operating and financial result for example during the fourth quarter of due in part to the prolonged adverse impact of the pandemic on our earnings we recorded an increase of billion to the valuation allowance associated with deferred income tax asset the pandemic also is expected to heighten many of the other risk described below for example the covid pandemic could cause and continue to cause an increasingly competitive labor market due to sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rate within our employee base further the covid pandemic may also affect our operating and financial result in manner that is not presently known to or that we currently do not expect to present significant risk to our operation or financial result risk related to our business and operationswe remain subject to number of risk and uncertainty related to the max these risk include uncertainty regarding the timing and condition of remaining max regulatory approval lower than planned production rate and or delivery rate additional consideration to customer increased supplier cost and supply chain health change to the assumption and estimate made in our financial statement regarding the program and potential outcome of max related legal proceeding and government investigation that remain outstanding on march the faa issued an order to suspend operation of all max aircraft in the and by aircraft operator following two fatal max accident non civil aviation authority issued directive to the same effect delivery of the max were suspended until december the grounding reduced revenue operating margin and cash flow and will continue to do until production rate return to pre grounding level while we have received regulatory approval to return the max to service in most jurisdiction we continue to work with certain non civil aviation authority to complete remaining step toward certification and readiness for return to service worldwide any delay in the completion of the certification activity and or the ramp up of delivery or other liability associated with the accident or grounding could have material adverse effect on our financial position result of operation and or cash flow in addition multiple legal action have been filed related to the max we also are fully cooperating with government investigation related to the accident and the max including an ongoing investigation by the security and exchange commission we also remain subject to compliance with deferred prosecution agreement with the department of justice relating to the department of justice investigation into regarding the evaluation of the max airplane by the faa we expensed million in the fourth quarter of related to this agreement any further adverse impact related to any such litigation or investigation could have further material impact on our financial position result of operation and or cash flow during we announced plan to reduce and ultimately to suspend production impact related to our suspension of max production from to significantly increased cost to produce aircraft included in the current accounting quantity and have resulted in reduced program and overall bca segment operating margin we have also made significant assumption regarding estimated cost expected to be incurred in that should be included in program inventory and those estimated cost that will be expensed when incurred abnormal production cost if the completion of remaining certification activity and or our ability to deliver aircraft to customer is impaired we will incur significant additional cost and or be required to delay the planned ramp up of production these delay would also result in significant additional disruption to the production system and of contentsfurther delay effort to restore and or implement previously planned increase in the production rate cash flow continue to be negatively impacted by delayed payment from customer higher cost and inventory level and payment made to customer in connection with disruption to their operation in addition we have experienced claim and assertion from customer in connection with the grounding and associated delivery delay and recorded an estimate of potential concession and other consideration to customer for these disruption of december the remaining liability associated with these concession and other consideration totaled billion of which billion remains subject to negotiation any further delay in regulatory approval of the max in one or more jurisdiction further disruption to supplier and or the long term health of the production system supplier claim or assertion or change to estimated concession or other consideration we expect to provide to customer could have material adverse effect on our financial position result of operation and or cash flow in the event of unanticipated additional training requirement in one or more jurisdiction delay in regulatory approval and or delay in our ability to resume delivery to one or more customer we may be required to take action with longer term impact such further change to our production plan employment reduction and or the expenditure of significant resource to support our supply chain and or customer we have made significant estimate with respect to the program regarding the number of unit to be produced the period during which those unit are likely to be produced and the unit expected sale price production cost program tooling and other non recurring cost and routine warranty cost we have made assumption regarding outcome of accident investigation and other government inquiry timing of future production rate increase timing and sequence of future delivery supply chain health we implement our production plan well outcome of negotiation with customer any change in these estimate and or assumption with respect to the program could have material impact on our financial position result of operation and or cash flow in addition to the impact of covid described above our commercial airplane and global service business depend heavily on commercial airline and are subject to unique risk market condition have significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related service the commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long term trend in airline passenger and cargo traffic the principal factor underlying long term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging market demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline profitability availability of aircraft financing world trade policy government to government relation technological advance price and other competitive factor fuel price terrorism epidemic and environmental regulation traditionally the airline industry ha been cyclical and competitive and ha experienced significant profit swing and constant challenge to be more cost competitive significant deterioration in the global economic environment the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of our major customer could result in fewer new order for aircraft or service or could cause customer to seek to postpone or cancel contractual order and or payment to which could result in lower revenue profitability and cash flow and reduction in our contractual backlog in addition our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over period of several year any of these macroeconomic industry or customer impact could unexpectedly affect delivery over long period we enter into firm fixed price aircraft sale contract with indexed price escalation clause which could subject to loss if we have cost overrun or if increase in our cost exceed the applicable escalation rate commercial aircraft sale contract are often entered into year the aircraft are delivered in order to help account for economic fluctuation between the contract date and delivery date aircraft pricing generally consists of fixed amount modified by price escalation formula of contentsderived from labor commodity and other price index our revenue estimate are based on current expectation with respect to these escalation formula but the actual escalation amount are outside of our control escalation factor can fluctuate significantly from period to period change in escalation amount can significantly impact revenue and operating margin in our commercial airplane business we derive significant portion of our revenue from limited number of commercial airline we can make no assurance that any customer will exercise purchase option fulfill existing purchase commitment or purchase additional product or service from in addition fleet decision airline consolidation or financial challenge involving any of our major commercial airline customer could significantly reduce our revenue and limit our opportunity to generate profit from those customer our commercial airplane business depends on our ability to maintain healthy production system ensure every airplane in our production system conforms to our exacting specification achieve planned production rate target successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standard the commercial aircraft business is extremely complex involving extensive coordination and integration with and non supplier highly skilled labor from thousand of employee and other partner and stringent regulatory requirement including the risk of evolving standard for commercial aircraft certification and performance and reliability standard the faa ha been working to implement safety reform such the implementation of the faa reauthorization act and the aircraft certification safety and accountability act among them changing the process for certification of commercial aircraft comparable agency that regulate similar matter in other country may adopt similar change to the extent the faa or other similar regulatory agency outside the implement more stringent regulation we may incur additional cost to achieve compliance in addition the introduction of new aircraft program and or derivative such the involves increased risk associated with meeting development testing production and certification schedule the program experienced significant disruption due to the grounding of the max and associated suspension of commercial operation of the max aircraft by civil aviation authority around the globe max delivery resumed in late and early upon approval of the faa and other non civil aviation authority during and we experienced production quality issue including in our supply chain which have contributed to lower delivery including pause in delivery since may during this resulted in reprioritizing production resource to support inspection and rework we continue to conduct inspection and rework on undelivered aircraft and engage in detailed discussion with the faa regarding required action for resuming delivery number of our customer may have contractual remedy including compensation for late delivery well right to reject individual airplane delivery if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the contractual delivery date the regulator will ultimately determine the timing and condition for resuming delivery delay on the max and program have resulted in and may continue to result in customer the right to terminate order and or substitute order for other boeing aircraft we must minimize disruption caused by production change achieve operational stability and implement productivity improvement in order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability we have previously announced plan to adjust production rate on several of our commercial aircraft program during we reprioritized production resource to support inspection and rework on undelivered aircraft the program is currently producing at very low rate and expects that to continue until delivery resume we are also continuing to implement change in the production process designed to ensure that newly built airplane meet our specification and do not require further inspection and rework in addition we continue to seek opportunity to reduce the cost of building our aircraft including working with our supplier to reduce supplier cost identifying and implementing productivity improvement and optimizing how we manage inventory if production rate change at any of contentsof our commercial aircraft assembly facility are delayed or create significant disruption to our production system or if our supplier can not timely deliver component to at the cost and rate necessary to achieve our target we may be unable to meet delivery schedule and or the financial performance of one or more of our program may suffer operational challenge impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft program could result in production delay and or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft either of which would negatively impact our revenue and operating margin our commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex operational issue including delay or defect in supplier component failure to meet internal performance plan or delay or failure to achieve required regulatory approval could result in significant of sequence work and increased production cost well delayed delivery to customer impact to aircraft performance and or increased warranty or fleet support cost for example in we performed additional inspection and associated rework on aircraft in inventory and continued discussion with the faa regarding required action to resume delivery resulting in additional cost and further delay in aircraft delivery to customer if our commercial airplane fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirement we could face additional cost and or lower revenue developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standard well those of customer and regulatory agency can be costly and technologically challenging these challenge are particularly significant with newer aircraft program any failure of any boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirement could result in disruption to our operation higher cost and or lower revenue change in level of government defense spending or overall acquisition priority could negatively impact our financial position and result of operation we derive substantial portion of our revenue from the government primarily from defense related program with the dod level of defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factor such the evolving nature of the national security threat environment national security strategy foreign policy the domestic political environment macroeconomic condition and the ability of the government to enact relevant legislation such authorization and appropriation bill the timeliness of and future appropriation for government department and agency remains recurrent risk lapse in appropriation for government department or agency would result in full or partial government shutdown which could impact the company operation alternatively congress may fund government department and agency with one or more continuing resolution however this would restrict the execution of certain program activity and delay new program or competition in addition long term uncertainty remains with respect to overall level of defense spending in and beyond and it is likely that government discretionary spending including defense spending will continue to be subject to pressure there continues to be uncertainty with respect to future acquisition priority and program level appropriation for the dod and other government agency including nasa including change to national security and defense priority and tension between modernization investment sustainment investment and investment in new technology or emergent capability future investment priority change or budget cut including change associated with the authorization and appropriation process could result in reduction cancellation and or delay of existing contract or program or future program opportunity any of these impact could have material effect on the result of the company financial position result of operation and or cash flow in addition result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both defense spending and the evolving nature of the national security threat environment we also expect the dod to continue to emphasize affordability innovation cybersecurity and delivery of technical data and of contentssoftware in it procurement process if we can no longer adjust successfully to these changing acquisition policy our revenue and market share could be impacted also additional federal appropriation to cover the increased cost of federal contractor compliance with evolving government contractual requirement associated with covid mitigation are unlikely reducing the government buying power our ability to deliver product and service that satisfy customer requirement is heavily dependent on the performance and financial stability of our subcontractor and supplier well on the availability of raw material and other component we rely on other company including and non subcontractor and supplier to provide and produce raw material integrated component and sub assembly and production commodity and to perform some of the service that we provide to our customer if one or more of our supplier or subcontractor experience financial difficulty delivery delay or other performance problem we may be unable to meet commitment to our customer or incur additional cost in addition if one or more of the raw material on which we depend such aluminum titanium or composite becomes unavailable to or our supplier or is available only at very high price we may be unable to deliver one or more of our product in timely fashion or at budgeted cost in some instance we depend upon single source of supply any service disruption from one of these supplier either due to circumstance beyond the supplier control such geopolitical development or result of performance problem or financial difficulty could have material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitment to our customer or increase our operating cost competition within our market and with respect to the product we sell may reduce our future contract and sale the market in which we operate are highly competitive and one or more of our competitor may have more extensive or more specialized engineering manufacturing and marketing capability than we do in some area in our commercial airplane business we anticipate increasing competition among non aircraft manufacturer of commercial jet aircraft in our bd business we anticipate that the effect of defense industry consolidation shifting acquisition and budget priority and continued cost pressure at our dod and non customer will intensify competition for many of our bd product our bgs segment face competition from many of the same strong and non competitor facing bca and bd furthermore we are facing increased international competition and cross border consolidation of competition there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitor or that the competitive pressure we face will not result in reduced revenue and market share we derive significant portion of our revenue from non sale and are subject to the risk of business in other country in non customer which includes foreign military sale fm accounted for approximately of our revenue we expect that non sale will continue to account for significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future result we are subject to risk of doing business internationally including change in regulatory requirement or other executive branch action such executive order change in the global trade environment including dispute with authority in non jurisdiction including international trade authority that could impact sale and or delivery of product and service outside the and or impose cost on our customer in the form of tariff duty or penalty attributable to the importation of boeing product and service of content and non government policy including requirement to expend portion of program fund locally and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirement fluctuation in international currency exchange rate volatility in international political and economic environment and change in non national priority and budget which can lead to delay or fluctuation in order the complexity and necessity of using non representative and consultant the uncertainty of the ability of non customer to finance purchase including the availability of financing from the export import bank of the united state uncertainty and restriction concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantee imposition of domestic and international tax export control tariff embargo sanction and other trade restriction the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many country compliance with variety of non law well law affecting the activity of company abroad and unforeseen development and condition including terrorism war epidemic and international tension and conflict while the impact of these factor is difficult to predict any one or more of these factor could adversely affect our operation in the future for example since the and china have imposed tariff on each other import china is very significant market for commercial airplane and represents significant component of our commercial airplane backlog impact from these or future potential tariff or deterioration in trade relation between the and one or more other country could have material adverse impact on our financial position result of operation and or cash flow we use estimate in accounting for many contract and program change in our estimate could adversely affect our future financial result contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risk estimating revenue and cost and making assumption for schedule and technical issue due to the size and nature of many of our contract and program the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variable assumption have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because cost also include expected increase in wage and employee benefit material price and allocated fixed cost incentive or penalty related to performance on contract are considered in estimating sale and profit rate and are recorded when there is sufficient information for to ass anticipated performance supplier claim and assertion are also assessed and considered in estimating cost and profit rate estimate of future award fee are also included in sale and profit rate with respect to each of our commercial aircraft program inventoriable production cost including overhead program tooling and other non recurring cost and routine warranty cost are accumulated and charged cost of sale by program instead of by individual unit or contract program consists of the estimated number of unit accounting quantity of product to be produced in continuing long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contract limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimate to establish the relationship of sale to cost of sale program accounting requires estimate of the number of unit to be produced and sold in program the period over which the unit can reasonably be expected to be produced and the unit expected sale price production cost program tooling and other non recurring cost and routine warranty cost for the total program several factor determine accounting quantity including firm order letter of intent from prospective customer and market study change to customer or model mix of contentsproduction cost and rate learning curve change to price escalation index cost of derivative aircraft supplier performance customer and supplier negotiation settlement supplier claim and or certification issue can impact these estimate in addition on development program such the we are subject to risk with respect to the timing and condition of aircraft certification including potential gap between when aircraft are certified in various jurisdiction change in certification process and our estimate with respect to timing of future certification which could have an impact on overall program status any such change in estimate relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financial performance because of the significance of the judgment and estimation process described above materially different sale and profit amount could be recorded if we used different assumption or if the underlying circumstance were to change change in underlying assumption circumstance or estimate may adversely affect future period financial performance for additional information on our accounting policy for recognizing sale and profit see our discussion under management discussion and analysis critical accounting policy estimate accounting for long term contract program accounting on page and note to our consolidated financial statement on page of this form we may not realize the anticipated benefit of merger acquisition joint venture strategic alliance or divestiture part of our business strategy we may merge with or acquire business and or form joint venture and strategic alliance whether we realize the anticipated benefit from these acquisition and related activity depends in part upon our ability to integrate the operation of the acquired business the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operation accordingly our financial result could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issue legacy liability transaction related charge amortization of expense related to intangible charge for impairment of long term asset credit guarantee partner performance and indemnification consolidation of joint venture could also impact our reported result of operation or financial position while we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedure and process to mitigate these risk there is no assurance that these transaction will be successful we also may make strategic divestiture from time to time these transaction may result in continued financial involvement in the divested business such through guarantee or other financial arrangement following the transaction nonperformance by those divested business could affect our future financial result through additional payment obligation higher cost or asset write down risk related to our contractswe conduct significant portion of our business pursuant to government contract which are subject to unique risk in of our revenue were earned pursuant to government contract which include fm through the government business conducted pursuant to such contract is subject to extensive procurement regulation and other unique risk our sale to the government are subject to extensive procurement regulation and change to those regulation could increase our cost new procurement regulation or change to existing requirement could increase our compliance cost or otherwise have material impact on the operating margin of our bd and bgs business these requirement may also result in withheld payment and or reduced future business if we fail to comply for example proposal to raise domestic content threshold for our government contract could have negative impact on our business compliance cost attributable to current and potential future procurement regulation such these could negatively impact our financial position result of operation and or cash flow of contentsthe government may modify curtail or terminate one or more of our contract the government contracting party may modify curtail or terminate it contract and subcontract with without prior notice and either at it convenience or for default based on performance in addition funding pursuant to our government contract may be reduced or withheld part of the congressional appropriation process due to fiscal constraint change in national security strategy and or priority or other reason further uncertainty with respect to ongoing program could also result in the event that the government finance it operation through temporary funding measure such continuing resolution rather than full year appropriation any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and or modification curtailment or termination of one or more large program could have material adverse effect on our financial position result of operation and or cash flow we are subject to government inquiry and investigation including periodic audit of cost that we determine are reimbursable under government contract government agency including the defense contract audit agency and the defense contract management agency routinely audit government contractor these agency review our performance under contract cost structure and compliance with applicable law regulation and standard well the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control system and policy any cost found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to specific contract will be deemed non reimbursable and to the extent already reimbursed must be refunded any inadequacy in our system and policy could result in withholds on billed receivables penalty and reduced future business furthermore if any audit inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activity we could be subject to civil and criminal penalty and administrative sanction including termination of contract forfeiture of profit suspension of payment fine and suspension or debarment from doing business with the government we also could suffer reputational harm if allegation of impropriety were made against even if such allegation are later determined to be false we enter into fixed price contract which could subject to loss if we have cost overrun our bd and bgs defense business generated approximately and of their revenue from fixed price contract while fixed price contract enable to benefit from performance improvement cost reduction and efficiency they also subject to the risk of reduced margin or incurring loss if we are unable to achieve estimated cost and revenue in addition increased compliance cost and cost due to loss of productivity due to covid may not be reimbursed if our estimated cost exceed our estimated price we recognize reach forward loss which can significantly affect our reported result for example in the fourth quarter of bd recorded additional loss of million on the kc tanker contract reflecting continued disruption in the factory and in the supply chain including impact of covid and an increase in cost to complete the new remote vision system the customer requirement definition ha evolved new program could also have risk for reach forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance the long term nature of many of our contract make the process of estimating cost and revenue on fixed price contract inherently risky fixed price contract often contain price incentive and penalty tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impact on margin in addition some of our contract have specific provision relating to cost schedule and performance fixed price development contract are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed price production contract many of these development program have highly complex design in addition technical or quality issue that arise during development could lead to schedule delay and higher cost to complete which could result in material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition example of significant bd fixed price development contract include commercial crew kc tanker red hawk vc presidential aircraft mq and commercial and military satellite of contentswe enter into cost type contract which also carry risk our bd and bgs defense business generated approximately and of their revenue from cost type contracting arrangement some of these are development program that have complex design and technical challenge these cost type program typically have award or incentive fee that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended period in these case the associated financial risk are primarily in reduced fee lower profit rate or program cancellation if cost schedule or technical performance issue arise program whose contract are primarily cost type include ground based midcourse defense gmd proprietary and sl program we enter into contract that include in orbit incentive payment that subject to risk contract in the

provides selective financing solution for our boeing customer business environment and trendsthe global outbreak of covid production issue and associated rework and the residual impact of the max grounding continued to have significant adverse impact on our business in the covid pandemic ha caused an unprecedented shock to demand for air travel creating tremendous challenge for our customer our business and the entire commercial aerospace manufacturing and service sector the latest international air transport association iata release reported that passenger traffic in recovered to approximately of level international market saw continued reopening challenge additionally global economic activity is improving but continues to be impacted by covid and government continue to restrict travel to contain the spread of the virus while recovery is accelerating we continue to expect that it will remain uneven travel restriction and varying regional travel protocol continue to impact air travel generally we continue to expect domestic travel to recover faster than international travel result we expect the narrow body market to recover faster than the wide body market also the pace of the commercial market recovery will be heavily dependent on covid infection rate vaccination rate and government travel and other restriction on trade and commercial activity demand for dedicated freighter continues to be strong underpinned by strong recovery in global trade and overall air cargo growth overall cargo capacity remains challenged given the large impact that covid ha had on international passenger operation which also carry cargo of contentsairline financial performance which also play role in the demand for new capacity ha been adversely impacted by the covid pandemic according to iata net loss for the airline industry were billion in and are expected to be approximately billion in our customer are taking action to combat the effect of the covid pandemic on the market by preserving liquidity this come in many form such deferral of advance and other payment to supplier deferral of delivery reduced spending on service and in some case cancellation of order while the outlook is improving and we have seen an increase in new order in we continue to face challenging environment in the near to medium term airline have adjusted to reduced traffic which in turn ha resulted in lower demand for commercial aerospace product and service the current environment is also affecting the financial viability of some airline we continue to expect commercial air travel to return to level in to we expect it will take year beyond that for the industry to return to long term trend growth to balance the supply and demand given the covid shock and to preserve our long term potential and competitiveness we have reduced the production rate of several of our bca program these rate decision are based on our ongoing assessment of the demand environment and availability of aircraft financing there is significant uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic level will recover and whether and at what point capacity will return to and or exceed pre covid level during the fourth quarter of we made adjustment to our estimate regarding timing of entry into service and market demand we continue to anticipate that the first delivery will occur in late we will closely monitor the key factor that affect backlog and future demand for each of our commercial aircraft program including customer evolving fleet plan the wide body replacement cycle and the cargo market we will maintain disciplined rate management process and make adjustment appropriate in the future notwithstanding the change we have made to production rate risk remains that further reduction will be required additionally if we are unable to make timely delivery of the large number of aircraft in inventory of december future revenue earnings and cash flow will be adversely impacted delivery of the max resumed in the fourth quarter of when the federal aviation administration faa rescinded the order that grounded max aircraft in the in addition other non civil aviation authority including the brazilian national civil aviation agency transport canada and the european union aviation safety agency have subsequently approved return of operation allowing to resume delivery in those jurisdiction over country have approved the resumption of max operation the civil aviation administration of china issued an airworthiness directive in the fourth quarter of outlining action required for airline to return to service we expect max delivery to china to resume in subject to final regulatory approval although risk remains around the timing and rate of those delivery order to suspend operation of max aircraft from non civil aviation authority are still in effect in small number of country delivery and production have also been impacted by production issue and associated rework for example delivery of the are currently paused and the production rate ha been reduced while we focus on rework of undelivered aircraft and continue to engage in detailed discussion with the faa regarding required action for resuming delivery risk remains that these issue may continue to impact the timing of airplane delivery in inventory and or our ability to achieve planned production rate revenue earnings and cash flow will continue to be impacted until we are able to resume timely delivery of contentsthe long term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental driver of air travel demand economic growth increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade globalization and improved airline service driven by liberalization of air traffic right between country the shock from covid ha reduced the near to medium term demand but our commercial market outlook forecast project growth rate for passenger and cargo traffic over year period based on long term global economic growth projection of average annual gross domestic product gdp growth we project demand for approximately new airplane over the next year the industry remains vulnerable to exogenous development including fuel price spike credit market shock act of terrorism natural disaster conflict epidemic pandemic and increased global environmental regulation continuing resolution cr enacted on december continues funding for the federal government at appropriated level through february congress and the president must enact either full year appropriation bill or an additional cr to fund government department and agency beyond february or government shutdown could result which may impact the company operation at bgs while the outlook is improving we are continuing to see direct impact on our commercial supply chain business fewer flight and more aircraft parked result in decreased demand for our part and logistics offering additionally our commercial customer are curtailing discretionary spending such modification and upgrade and focusing on required maintenance similar to bca we expect multi year recovery period for the commercial service business the demand outlook for our government service business remains stable government service comprises approximately half of bgs revenue which is unchanged from pre pandemic level at bd we continue to see healthy market with solid demand for our major platform and program both domestically and internationally however while we continue to experience near term production disruption and inefficiency due to covid impact we saw improvement in in addition we are experiencing some supply chain shortage our supplier are also experiencing liquidity pressure and disruption to their operation result of covid we continue to monitor the health and stability of the supply chain we ramp up production these measure and disruption have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial position result of operation and cash flow we continue to transform and improve our business process these activity are not intended to constrain our capacity but to enable the company to emerge stronger and be more resilient when the market recovers we expect that successful execution of these measure will improve near term liquidity and long term cost competitiveness of

approximately of commercial airplane total backlog in dollar term is with non airline we face aggressive international competitor who are intent on increasing their market share they offer competitive product and have access to most of the same customer and supplier the grounding of the max and the associated suspension of max delivery in multiple jurisdiction significantly reduced our market share with respect to delivery of single aisle aircraft in and and may provide competitor with an opportunity to obtain more order and increase market share with government support airbus ha historically invested heavily to create family of product to compete with after the acquisition of majority share of bombardier series in airbus continues to expand in the seat transcontinental market other competitor are also in different phase of developing commercial jet aircraft some of these competitor have historically enjoyed access to government provided financial support including launch aid which greatly reduces the cost and commercial risk associated with airplane development activity this ha enabled the development of airplane without broad commercial viability others to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible and many offered for sale below market based price competitor continue to make improvement in efficiency which may result in funding product development gaining market share and improving earnings this market environment ha resulted in intense pressure on pricing and other competitive factor and we expect these pressure to continue or intensify in the

delivery of max aircraft and or if entry into service of the max and or max is further delayed we may experience additional reduction to backlog and or significant order cancellation additionally we may continue to experience fewer new order and increased cancellation across all of our commercial airplane program result of the covid pandemic and associated impact on demand accounting quantity the accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplane that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contract the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimate of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contract it is key determinant of the gross margin we recognize on sale of individual airplane throughout program life estimation of each program accounting quantity take into account several factor that are indicative of the demand for that program including firm order letter of intent from prospective customer and market study we review our program accounting quantity quarterly the accounting quantity for each program may include unit that have been delivered undelivered unit under

quarter of in we began offering the freighter to customer and expect to receive initial order in during the fourth quarter of we revised the estimated first delivery date of the to late and recorded billion reach forward loss on the program the revised schedule and reach of contentsforward loss reflected number of factor including an updated assessment of global certification requirement informed by continued discussion with regulator and management decision in the fourth quarter of to make modification to the aircraft design an updated assessment of covid impact on market demand and discussion with our customer with respect to aircraft delivery timing these factor resulted in adjustment to production rate and the program accounting quantity increased change incorporation cost and associated customer and supply chain impact the initial accounting quantity of airplane established in the fourth quarter of consists of passenger airplane and remained unchanged during we are working towards reaching type inspection authorization tia which will enable to begin faa certification flight testing the timing of tia and certification will ultimately be determined by the regulator and further determination with respect to anticipated certification requirement could result in additional delay in entry into service and or additional cost increase we continue to anticipate that the first delivery will occur in late the program ha near break even gross margin at december the level of profitability on the program will be subject to number of factor these factor include continued market uncertainty the impact of covid on our production system well impact on our supply chain and customer customer negotiation further production rate adjustment for the or other commercial aircraft program contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risk associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification one or more of these factor could result in additional reach forward loss on the program in future period program during we experienced significant reduction in delivery due to the impact of covid on our customer well production issue and associated rework during we delivered aircraft between march and may prior to delivery being paused in may delivery remain paused at december and we had approximately and aircraft in inventory we have identified production quality issue including in our supply chain which have contributed to the pause in delivery in july we announced that we were reprioritizing production resource to support inspection and rework we continue to conduct inspection and rework on undelivered aircraft and engage in detailed discussion with the faa regarding required action for resuming delivery of the we are currently producing at very low rate and expect that to continue until delivery resume gradually returning to per month over time in the third quarter of we determined that in the current environment production rate below per month represent abnormally low production rate and result in abnormal production cost and that inspection and rework cost on inventoried aircraft are excessive and should also be accounted for abnormal production cost that are required to be expensed incurred in the fourth quarter of we determined that the ongoing rework well our ongoing discussion with the faa in anticipation of resumption of delivery will result in lower production rate longer than previously expected result of these impact we expect to incur approximately billion of abnormal production cost on cumulative basis with most being incurred by the end of we continue to work with customer and supplier regarding timing of future delivery and production rate change we are also continuing to implement change in the production process designed to ensure that newly built airplane meet our specification and do not require further inspection and rework during the first quarter of we consolidated production in south carolina in line with our previous assumption which did not have significant financial impact on the program during the fourth quarter of we recorded loss of billion on the program primarily due to the additional rework well other action required to resume delivery taking longer than of contentsexpected these impact have resulted in longer than expected delivery delay and associated customer consideration the timing of the resumption of delivery and future production rate will depend upon rework ongoing customer and supplier engagement production stability and our activity with the faa china is significant market for the program and if the program is unable to obtain additional order from china in future quarter we may be required to further adjust production rate assumption if we are required to further reduce the accounting quantity and or production rate experience further delivery delay or experience other factor that result in lower margin the program could record additional loss and higher abnormal production cost in future period fleet support we provide the operator of our commercial airplane with assistance and service to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation collectively known fleet support service these activity and service begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane they include flight and maintenance training field service support engineering service information service and system and technical data and document the cost for fleet support are expensed incurred and have historically been approximately of total consolidated cost of product and service program development the following chart summarizes the time horizon between go ahead and planned initial delivery for major commercial airplane derivative and program go ahead and initial max max model in development during development schedule shown above are subject to number of uncertainty including change in certification requirement the timing of certification will ultimately be determined by the regulator additional considerationsthe development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex involving extensive coordination and integration with supplier and highly skilled labor from employee and other partner meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standard well those of customer and regulator can be costly and technologically challenging such the production issue and associated rework in addition the introduction of new aircraft and derivative such the and max derivative involves increased risk associated with meeting development production and certification schedule these challenge include increased global regulatory scrutiny of all development aircraft in the wake of the max accident result our ability to deliver aircraft on time satisfy performance and reliability standard and achieve or maintain applicable program profitability is subject to significant risk factor that could result in lower margin or material charge if an airplane program ha or is determined to have reach forward loss include the following change to the program accounting quantity customer and model mix production cost and rate change to price escalation factor due to change in the inflation rate or other economic indicator performance or reliability issue involving completed aircraft capital expenditure and other cost associated with increasing or adding new production capacity learning curve additional change incorporation achieving anticipated cost reduction the addition of regulatory requirement in connection with certification in one or more jurisdiction flight test and certification schedule cost schedule and demand for new airplane and derivative and status of customer claim supplier claim or assertion and other contractual negotiation while we believe the cost and revenue estimate of contentsincorporated in the consolidated

government contract other postretirement benefit cost are allocated to all business segment based on ca which is generally based on benefit paid the pension fa ca service cost adjustment recognized in loss from operation were benefit of million in million in and million in the lower benefit in were primarily due to reduction in allocated pension cost year over year the non operating pension expense included in other income net wa benefit of million in million in and million in the higher benefit in were primarily due to lower interest cost and higher expected return on plan asset partially

impact is calculated using the corporate statutory tax rate of contentscritical accounting policy estimatesaccounting for long term contractssubstantially all contract at bd and certain contract at bgs are long term contract our long term contract typically represent single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying good and or service and the significant service of integration that we provide accounting for long term contract involves judgmental process of estimating the total sale cost and profit for each performance obligation cost of sale is recognized incurred and revenue is determined by adding proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported cost of sale due to the size duration and nature of many of our long term contract the estimation of total sale and cost through completion is complicated and subject to many variable total sale estimate are based on negotiated contract price and quantity modified by our assumption regarding contract option change order incentive and award provision associated with technical performance and price adjustment clause such inflation or index based clause the majority of these long term contract are with the government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit federal acquisition regulation provide guidance on the type of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price total cost estimate are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract term historical performance trend business base and other economic projection factor that influence these estimate include inflationary trend technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trend business volume assumption covid disruption asset utilization and anticipated labor agreement revenue and cost estimate for all significant long term contract performance obligation are reviewed and reassessed quarterly change in these estimate could result in recognition of cumulative catch up adjustment to the performance obligation inception to date revenue cost of sale and profit in the period in which such change are made change in revenue and cost estimate could also result in reach forward loss or an adjustment to reach forward loss which would be recorded immediately in earnings for the year ended december and net unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustment across all long term contract increased loss from operation by million million and million respectively the cumulative catch up adjustment in were primarily due to loss recognized on the kc tanker vc and commercial crew program these are all fixed price development program and there is ongoing risk that similar loss may have to be recognized in future period on these and or other program due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if we used different assumption or if the underlying circumstance were to change change in underlying assumption estimate supplier performance or circumstance may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future period if the combined gross margin for our profitable long term contract had been estimated to be higher or lower by during it would have increased or decreased pre tax income for the year by approximately million program accountingprogram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate revenue cost and gross profit margin for the defined program accounting quantity program consists of the estimated number of unit accounting quantity of product to be produced in continuing long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contract the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimate of contentsfactors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity sale price labor and employee benefit cost material cost procured part cost major component cost overhead cost program tooling and other non recurring cost and warranty cost estimation of the accounting quantity for each program take into account several factor that are indicative of the demand for the particular program such firm order letter of intent from prospective customer and market study total estimated program sale are determined by estimating the model mix and sale price for all unsold unit within the accounting quantity added together with the sale price for all undelivered unit under contract the sale price for all undelivered unit within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly cost estimate are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contract with supplier historical performance trend and business base and other economic projection factor that influence these estimate include production rate internal and subcontractor performance trend customer and or supplier claim or assertion asset utilization anticipated labor agreement covid disruption and inflationary or deflationary trend to ensure reliability in our estimate we employ rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on quarterly basis this includes reassessing the accounting quantity change in estimate of program gross profit margin are normally recognized on prospective basis however when estimated cost to complete program plus cost already included in inventory exceed estimated revenue from the program loss is recorded in the current period reduction to the estimated loss are included in the gross profit margin for undelivered unit in the accounting quantity whereas increase to the estimated loss are recorded an earnings charge in the period in which the loss is determined the and program have near break even margin and the program ha zero margin at december adverse change to the revenue and or cost estimate for these program could result in additional earnings charge in future period program during the fourth quarter of we revised the estimated first delivery date of the to late and recorded billion reach forward loss on the program the revised schedule and reach forward loss reflected number of factor including an updated assessment of global certification requirement informed by continued discussion with regulator and management decision in the fourth quarter of to make modification to the aircraft design an updated assessment of covid impact on market demand and discussion with our customer with respect to aircraft delivery timing these factor resulted in adjustment to production rate and the program accounting quantity increased change incorporation cost and associated customer and supply chain impact the initial accounting quantity of airplane established in the fourth quarter of consists of passenger airplane and remained unchanged during we are working towards reaching tia which will enable to begin faa certification flight testing the timing of tia and certification will ultimately be determined by the regulator and further determination with respect to anticipated certification requirement could result in additional delay in entry into service and or additional cost increase we continue to anticipate that the first delivery will occur in late the program ha near break even gross margin at december the level of profitability on the program will be subject to number of factor these factor include continued market uncertainty the impact of covid on our production system well impact on our supply chain and customer customer negotiation further production rate adjustment for the or other commercial aircraft program contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risk associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification one or more of these factor could result in additional reach forward loss on the program in future period which may be material of program the program production issue and delivery pause result in significant uncertainty regarding the revenue and cost estimate for the program delivery have remained paused since may during the fourth quarter of we recorded loss of billion on the program primarily due to rework driving longer delivery delay than were previously expected and associated customer consideration the estimate of customer consideration is based on number of factor including our current assumption regarding timing of faa approval enabling resumption of delivery estimated timing of completion of inspection and rework to enable delivery in future period estimated timing of production rate increase well customer and market assessment we continue to conduct inspection and rework and engage in detailed discussion with the faa regarding required action for resuming delivery of the our program revenue and cost estimate reflect the assumption that production rate will remain very low until delivery resume gradually returning to per month over time we have also assumed lower forecasted revenue due to delayed delivery our program assumption reflect our current best estimate however if the program experience further delivery delay or other factor such additional inspection or rework that result in lower revenue or higher cost estimate we could record additional loss in future period which may be material goodwill impairmentswe test goodwill for impairment by performing qualitative assessment or quantitative test if we choose to perform qualitative assessment we evaluate economic industry and company specific factor an initial step in assessing the fair value of the reporting unit if we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net asset is more than the fair value of the reporting unit quantitative test is performed otherwise no further testing is required for reporting unit where the quantitative test is used we compare the carrying value of net asset to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit if the fair value is determined to be le than carrying value the shortfall up to the carrying value of the goodwill represents the amount of goodwill impairment we generally estimate the fair value of our reporting unit using combination of discounted cash flow and market based valuation methodology such comparable public company trading value forecast of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future sale operating cost and change in working capital these forecast reflect existing firm order expected future order expected production rate and delivery profile contract with supplier labor agreement and general market condition change in these forecast could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded if any the cash flow forecast are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus suitable control premium at the date of evaluation therefore change in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded if any we completed our annual assessment of goodwill of april and determined that there wa no impairment of goodwill of december we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded it corresponding carrying value change in our forecast discount rate or decrease in the value of our common stock could cause book value to exceed their fair value which may result in goodwill impairment charge in future period pension plansmany of our employee have earned benefit under defined benefit pension plan nonunion and the majority of union employee that had participated in defined benefit pension plan transitioned to company funded defined contribution retirement saving plan in additional union employee transitioned to company funded defined contribution retirement saving plan effective january accounting rule require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan asset these measurement are based upon several assumption including the discount rate and the expected long term rate of asset return future change in assumption or difference between actual and expected of contentsoutcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense projected benefit obligation and shareholder equity the projected benefit obligation is sensitive to discount rate the projected benefit obligation would decrease by million or increase by million if the discount rate increased or decreased by basis point basis point change in the discount rate would not have significant impact on pension cost however net periodic pension cost is sensitive to change in the expected long term rate of asset return decrease or increase of basis point in the expected long term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased net periodic pension cost by million see note of the note to our consolidated financial statement which includes the discount rate and expected long term rate of asset return assumption for the last three year deferred income tax valuation allowancethe company ha deferred income tax asset of million at december that can be used in future year to offset taxable income and reduce income tax payable the company ha deferred income tax liability of million at december that will partially offset deferred income tax asset and result in higher taxable income in future year and increase income tax payable tax law determines whether future reversal of temporary difference will result in taxable and deductible amount that offset each other in future year the particular year in which temporary difference result in taxable or deductible amount generally are determined by the timing of the recovery of the related asset or settlement of the related liability on quarterly basis we ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset against future source of taxable income and reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax asset by recording valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not defined likelihood of more than that all or portion of such asset will not be realized this assessment take into account both positive and negative evidence recent history of financial reporting loss is heavily weighted source of objectively verifiable negative evidence due to our recent history of loss we determined we could not include future projected earnings in our analysis rather we use systematic and logical method to estimate when deferred tax liability will reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax asset will reverse and generate tax deduction the selection of methodology and assessment of when temporary difference will result in taxable or deductible amount involves significant management judgment and is inherently complex and subjective we believe that the methodology we use are reasonable and can be replicated on consistent basis in future period deferred tax liability represent the assumed source of future taxable income and the majority are assumed to generate taxable amount during the next five year deferred tax asset include amount related to pension and other postretirement benefit that are assumed to generate significant deductible amount beyond five year the company valuation allowance of million at december primarily relates to pension and other postretirement benefit obligation deferred tax asset that are assumed to reverse beyond the period in which reversal of deferred tax liability are assumed to occur during the company decreased the valuation allowance by primarily due to favorable pension remeasurement until the company generates sustained level of profitability additional valuation allowance may have to be recorded with corresponding adverse impact on earnings and or other comprehensive income for additional information regarding income tax see

note we operate in four reportable segment commercial airplane bca defense space security bd global service bgs and boeing capital bcc liquidity mattersthe global outbreak of covid production issue and associated rework and the residual impact of the max grounding continue to have significant adverse impact on our business and are expected to continue to negatively impact revenue earnings and operating cash flow in future quarter the covid pandemic ha caused an unprecedented shock to demand for air travel creating tremendous challenge for our customer our business and the entire commercial aerospace manufacturing and service sector we continue to expect commercial air travel to return to level in to we expect it will take few year beyond that for the industry to return to long term trend growth there is significant uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic level will recover and whether and at what point capacity will return to and or exceed pre covid level during net cash used by operating activity wa billion our operating cash flow continue to be impacted by lower commercial airplane delivery and concession paid to max customer we expect negative operating cash flow until commercial delivery ramp up in we issued billion of fixed rate senior note that mature between and we used the net proceeds of these note issuance to repay the billion outstanding under our two year delayed draw term loan credit agreement in we also repaid billion of term note result our cash and short term investment balance wa billion and our debt balance wa billion at december in addition we have term note of billion maturing in of december our unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit agreement is billion we anticipate that these revolving credit line will remain undrawn and primarily serve backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing need our borrowing capacity includes billion day revolving credit facility which is set to expire in october see note in our short term and long term credit rating by the major credit rating agency remained unchanged from there is risk for further downgrade at december and trade payable included billion and billion payable to supplier who have elected to participate in supply chain financing program while access to supply chain financing ha been reduced due to our current credit rating and debt level we do not believe that these or future change in the availability of supply chain financing will have significant impact on our liquidity in addition to our debt issuance we have taken number of action to improve liquidity during our board of director terminated it prior authorization to repurchase share of the company outstanding common stock and suspended the declaration and or payment of dividend until further of contentsnotice we have also reduced production rate in our commercial business to reflect the impact of covid on the industry we rationalized our workforce through combination of voluntary and involuntary layoff and natural turnover in the fourth quarter of we began using our common stock in lieu of cash to fund company contribution to our plan in december we awarded most of our employee one time stock grant that will vest in three year in lieu of merit pay increase we have reduced discretionary spending including reducing or deferring research and development and capital expenditure we expect these action to further enable the company to conserve cash we are also working with our customer and supply chain to accelerate receipt and conserve cash for example the united state department of defense dod ha taken step to work with it industry partner to increase liquidity in the form of increased progress payment rate and reduction in withholds among other initiative in addition the coronavirus aid relief and economic security care act included five year net operating loss carryback provision which enabled to benefit from certain loss and resulted in tax refund of billion in we continue to transform and improve our business process these activity are not intended to constrain our capacity but to enable the company to emerge stronger and be more resilient when the market recovers based on our current best estimate of market demand planned production rate timing of cash receipt and expenditure our ability to successfully implement further action to improve liquidity well our ability to access additional liquidity if needed we believe it is probable that we will be able to fund our operation for the foreseeable future use of estimatesthe preparation of financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability and disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period we believe that the accounting estimate and assumption are appropriate however given the increased uncertainty surrounding the severity and duration of the impact of the covid pandemic actual result could differ from those estimate operating cyclefor classification of certain current asset and liability we use the duration of the related contract or program our operating cycle which is generally longer than one year revenue and related cost recognitioncommercial aircraft contract the majority of our bca segment revenue is derived from commercial aircraft contract for each contract we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received we allocate the transaction price to each commercial aircraft performance obligation based on relative standalone selling price adjusted by an escalation formula specified in the customer agreement revenue is recognized for each commercial aircraft performance obligation at the point in time when the aircraft is completed and accepted by the customer we use program accounting to determine the amount reported cost of sale in certain situation where an aircraft is still in our possession and title and risk of loss ha passed to the customer known bill and hold arrangement revenue will be recognized when all specific requirement for transfer of control under bill and hold arrangement have been met of contentspayments for commercial aircraft sale are received in accordance with the customer agreement which generally includes deposit upon order and additional payment in accordance with payment schedule with the balance being due immediately prior to or at aircraft delivery advance and progress billing contract liability are normal and customary for commercial aircraft contract and not considered significant financing component they are intended to protect from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of it obligation under the contract long term contract substantially all contract at bd and certain contract at bgs are long term contract with the government and other customer that generally extend over several year product sale under long term contract primarily include fighter jet rotorcraft cybersecurity product surveillance suite advanced weapon missile defense military derivative aircraft satellite system and modification of commercial passenger aircraft to cargo freighter service sale under long term contract primarily include support and maintenance agreement associated with our commercial and defense product and space travel on commercial crew for each long term contract we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received we allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation to deliver good or service or collection of good and or service based on the relative standalone selling price long term contract will typically represent single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying good and or service and the significant service of integration that we provide while the scope and price on certain long term contract may be modified over their life the transaction price is based on current right and obligation under the contract and doe not include potential modification until they are agreed upon with the customer when applicable cumulative adjustment or separate recognition for the additional scope and price may result long term contract can be negotiated with fixed price or price in which we are reimbursed for cost incurred plus an agreed upon profit the federal acquisition regulation provide guidance on the type of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing the price for contract with the government certain long term contract include in the transaction price variable consideration such incentive and award fee if specified target are achieved the amount included in the transaction price represents the expected value based on weighted probability or the most likely amount long term contract revenue is recognized over the contract term over time the work progress either product are produced or service are rendered we generally recognize revenue over time we perform on long term contract because of continuous transfer of control to the customer for government contract this continuous transfer of control to the customer is supported by clause in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience pay for cost incurred plus reasonable profit and take control of any work in process similarly for non government contract the customer typically control the work in process evidenced either by contractual termination clause or by our right to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date on product or service that do not have an alternative use to the company the accounting for long term contract involves judgmental process of estimating total sale cost and profit for each performance obligation cost of sale is recognized incurred the amount reported revenue is determined by adding proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported cost of sale recognizing revenue cost are incurred provides an objective measure of progress on the long term contract and thereby best depicts the extent of transfer of control to the customer for long term contract for which revenue is recognized over time change in estimated revenue cost of sale and the related effect on operating income are recognized using cumulative catch up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the change on current and prior period based on long term contract percentage of completion when the current estimate of of contentstotal sale and cost for long term contract indicate loss provision for the entire reach forward loss on the long term contract is recognized net cumulative catch up adjustment to prior year revenue and earnings including certain reach forward loss across all long term contract were follows decrease to revenue increase to loss from operation decrease to diluted eps significant adjustment during the three year ended december included loss on kc tanker commercial crew and vc due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process change in underlying assumption estimate supplier performance or circumstance may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future period payment under long term contract may be received before or after revenue is recognized the government customer typically withholds payment of small portion of the contract price until contract completion therefore long term contract typically generate unbilled receivables contract asset but may generate advance and progress billing contract liability long term contract unbilled receivables and advance and progress billing are not considered significant financing component because they are intended to protect either the customer or the company in the event that some or all of the obligation under the contract are not completed commercial spare part contract certain contract at our bgs segment include sale of commercial spare part for each contract we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received the spare part have discrete unit price that represent fair value we generally consider each spare part to be separate performance obligation revenue is recognized for each commercial spare part performance obligation at the point in time of delivery to the customer we may provide our customer with right to return commercial spare part where customer may receive full or partial refund credit applied to amount owed different product in exchange or any combination of these item we consider the potential for customer return in the estimated transaction price the amount reported cost of sale is recorded at average cost payment for commercial spare part sale are typically received shortly after delivery other service revenue contract certain contract at our bgs segment are for sale of service to commercial customer including maintenance training data analytics and information based service we recognize revenue for these service performance obligation over time the service are rendered the method of measuring progress such straight line or billable amount varies depending upon which method best depicts the transfer of control to the customer based on the type of service performed cost of sale is recorded incurred concession sharing arrangement we account for sale concession to our customer in consideration of their purchase of product and service reduction of the transaction price and the revenue that is recognized for the related performance obligation the sale concession incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain supplier in accordance with concession sharing arrangement we record these reimbursement which are presumed to represent reduction in the price of the vendor product or service reduction in cost of product unbilled receivables and advance and progress billing unbilled receivables contract asset arise when the company recognizes revenue for amount which can not yet be billed under term of the of contentscontract with the customer advance and progress billing contract liability arise when the company receives payment from customer in advance of recognizing revenue the amount of unbilled receivables or advance and progress billing is determined for each contract financial service revenue we record financial service revenue associated with sale type finance lease operating lease and loan in sale of service on the consolidated statement of operation for sale type lease we recognize revenue if collection of the lease payment is probable for sale type and finance lease we record customer financing receivables at lease inception customer financing receivable is recorded at the aggregate of future minimum lease payment estimated residual value of the leased equipment and any deferred incremental direct cost le unearned income income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate level rate of return on the net investment for note receivable note are recorded customer financing receivables net of any unamortized discount and deferred incremental direct cost interest income and amortization of any discount are recorded ratably over the related term of the note income recognition is generally suspended for customer financing receivables that are uncollectible we determine that customer financing receivable is uncollectible when based on current information and event it is probable that we will be unable to collect amount due according to the original contractual term we determine customer financing receivable is past due when cash ha not been received upon the due date specified in the contract we evaluate the collectability of customer financing receivables at commencement and on recurring basis if customer financing receivable is determined to be uncollectible the customer is categorized non accrual status when customer is in non accrual status at commencement sale type lease revenue is deferred until substantially all cash ha been received or the customer is removed from non accrual status if we have direct finance lease and or note receivable with customer that is in non accrual status or sale type lease with customer that change to non accrual status after commencement we recognize contractual interest income payment are received to the extent there is sufficient collateral and payment exceed past due principal payment residual value which are reviewed periodically represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the leased equipment actual residual value realized could differ from these estimate decline in estimated residual value that are deemed other than temporary are recognized in the period in which the decline occur for operating lease revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on straight line basis over the term of the lease operating lease asset included in customer financing net are recorded at cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value using the straight line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset we periodically review our estimate of residual value and recognize forecasted change by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense

development arrangement that meet the requirement for best effort research and development accounting accordingly the amount funded by the customer are recognized an offset to our research and development expense rather than contract revenue research and development expense included bid and proposal cost of and in and respectively share based compensationwe provide various form of share based compensation to our employee for award settled in share we measure compensation expense based on the grant date fair value net of estimated forfeiture for award settled in cash or that may be settled in cash we measure compensation expense based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeiture the expense is recognized over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period of the award income taxesprovisions for federal state and local and non income tax are calculated on reported loss before income tax based on current tax law and also include in the current period the cumulative effect of any change in tax rate from those used previously in determining deferred tax asset and liability such provision differ from the amount currently receivable or payable because certain item of income and expense are recognized in different time period for financial reporting purpose than for income tax purpose significant judgment is required in determining income tax provision and evaluating tax position the accounting for uncertainty in income tax requires more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return we record liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purpose and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return to the extent that our assessment of such tax position change the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made tax related interest and penalty are classified component of income tax benefit we also ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset against future source of taxable income and reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax asset by recording valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that all or portion of such asset will not be realized change in our estimate and judgment regarding realization of deferred tax asset may result in an increase or decrease to our tax expense and or other comprehensive income which would be recorded in the

retirement saving plan effective january we also provide postretirement benefit plan other than pension consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retiree and qualifying dependent benefit under the pension and other postretirement benefit plan are generally based on age at retirement and year of service and for some pension plan benefit are also based on the employee annual earnings the net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plan is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumption the most significant of which are the discount rate the long term rate of asset return and medical trend rate of growth for medical cost portion of the service cost component of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production product cost and reflected in inventory at the end of reporting period actuarial gain and loss which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumption are reflected in shareholder equity net of tax if actuarial gain and loss exceed ten percent of the greater of plan asset or plan liability we amortize them over the average expected future lifetime of participant the funded status of our pension and postretirement plan is reflected on the consolidated statement of financial

remediation of contaminated site we routinely ass based on in depth study expert analysis and legal review our contingency obligation and commitment for remediation of contaminated site including assessment of range and probability of recovery from other responsible party and or insurance carrier our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposure related to environmental remediation site when it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated the amount of the liability is based on our best estimate or the low end of range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation cleanup and monitoring cost to be incurred estimated remediation cost are not discounted to present value the timing of payment can not be reasonably estimated we may be able to recover portion of the remediation cost from insurer or other third party such recovery are recorded when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable cash and

supplier advance deferred production cost represent actual cost incurred for production of early unit that exceed the estimated average cost of all unit in the program accounting quantity higher production cost are experienced at the beginning of new or derivative airplane program unit produced early in program require substantially more effort labor and other resource than unit produced later in program because of volume efficiency and the effect of learning we expect that these deferred cost will be fully recovered when all unit included in the accounting quantity are delivered the expected unit cost for later delivery is below the estimated average cost of all unit in the program supplier advance represent payment for part we have contracted to receive from supplier in the

amortized but are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstance change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist our annual testing date is april we test goodwill for impairment by performing qualitative assessment or using quantitative test if we choose to perform qualitative assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net asset is more than the fair value of the related operation the quantitative test is then performed otherwise no further testing is required for operation where the quantitative test is used we compare the carrying value of net asset to the estimated fair value of the related operation if the fair value is determined to be le than carrying value the shortfall up to the carrying value of the goodwill represents the amount of goodwill impairment indefinite lived intangible consist of brand and trade name and in process research and development ipr acquired in business combination ipr is initially capitalized at fair value an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter ipr is reclassified to finite lived acquired intangible asset when project is completed and then amortized on straight line basis over the asset estimated useful life we test these intangible for impairment by comparing the carrying value to current projection

purchase and sell aluminum to address long term strategic sourcing objective and non business requirement these agreement are derivative for accounting purpose but are not designated for hedge accounting treatment we also hold certain derivative instrument for economic purpose that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment for these aluminum agreement and for other derivative instrument not designated for hedge accounting treatment the change in their fair value are recorded in earnings immediately allowance for loss on certain financial assetswe establish allowance for credit loss on account receivable unbilled receivables customer financing receivables and certain other financial asset the adequacy of these allowance is assessed quarterly through consideration of factor such customer credit rating bankruptcy filing published or estimated credit default rate age of the receivable expected loss rate and collateral exposure we determine the creditworthiness of our customer by assigning internal credit rating based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from the customer our rating category are comparable to those used by major credit rating agency aircraft valuationused aircraft under trade in commitment and aircraft under repurchase commitment in conjunction with signing definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft sale aircraft we have entered into trade in commitment with certain customer that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at specified price upon the purchase of sale aircraft additionally we have entered into contingent repurchase commitment with certain customer wherein we agree to repurchase the sale aircraft at specified price generally to year after delivery of the sale aircraft our repurchase of the sale aircraft is contingent upon future mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft if we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft and if the customer exercise it right to sell the sale aircraft to contingent repurchase commitment would become trade in commitment our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitment infrequently become trade in commitment of contentsexposure related to trade in commitment may take the form of adjustment to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of the fair value of the trade in aircraft of the date of such agreement which would be recognized upon delivery of the sale aircraft and or charge to cost of product for adverse change in the fair value of trade in aircraft that occur subsequent to signing of definitive agreement for sale aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade in aircraft estimate based on current aircraft value would be included in accrued liability the fair value of trade in aircraft is determined using aircraft specific data such model age and condition market condition for specific aircraft and similar model and multiple valuation source this process us our assessment of the market for each trade in aircraft which in most instance begin year before the return of the aircraft there are several possible market in which we continually pursue opportunity to place used aircraft these market include but are not limited to the resale market which could potentially include the cost of long term storage the leasing market with the potential for refurbishment cost to meet the leasing customer requirement or the scrap market trade in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft on quarterly basis we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activity associated with placing each aircraft into market or using current published third party aircraft valuation based on the type and age of the aircraft adjusted for individual attribute and known condition used aircraft acquired by the commercial airplane segment are included in inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value it is our intent to sell these asset to mitigate cost and enhance marketability aircraft may be placed on operating lease while on operating lease the asset are included in customer financing customer financing customer financing includes operating lease equipment note receivable and sale type finance lease sale type finance lease are treated receivables and allowance for loss are established necessary customer financing is collateralized by security in the related asset we ass the fair value of equipment under operating lease asset held for sale or re lease and collateral underlying receivables to determine if their fair value are le than the related customer financing asset carrying value difference between carrying value and fair value of sale type finance lease and note and other receivables determined by collateral value are considered in determining the allowance for loss on receivables we use median calculated from published collateral value from multiple third party aircraft value publication based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft under certain circumstance we apply judgment based on the attribute of the specific aircraft or equipment usually when the feature or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attribute covered by outside publication impairment review for asset under operating lease and held for sale or re lease we evaluate for impairment asset under operating lease or asset held for sale or re lease when event or change in circumstance indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be le than the carrying value we use various assumption when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including our intention for how long we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold the expected future lease rate

asset we record asset held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value le cost to sell when we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset allowance for loss on customer financing receivables we record the estimated allowance for potential loss on customer financing receivables in valuation account the four primary factor influencing the level of our allowance for loss on customer financing receivables are collateral value internal customer credit rating default rate and expected loss rate we review the adequacy of the allowance for loss by assessing the collateral exposure the applicable default rate and expected loss rate collateral exposure for particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure the applicable default rate is determined using two component internal customer credit rating and weighted average remaining contract term we assign internal credit rating for all customer and determine the creditworthiness of each customer based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from our customer our rating category are comparable to those used by the major credit rating agency we apply an expected loss rate based on publicly available information to the applicable default rate we have entered into agreement with certain customer that would entitle to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable for purpose of determining the collateral exposure described above should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable creating shortfall condition these agreement would for example permit to take the action necessary to sell or retain certain other asset in which the customer ha an equity interest and use the proceeds to cover the shortfall each quarter we review the assigned internal customer credit rating published historical credit default rate for different rating category and multiple third party aircraft value publication basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for loss on customer financing receivables there can be no assurance that actual result will not differ from estimate or that the consideration of these factor in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance for loss on customer financing receivables warrantiesin conjunction with certain product sale we provide warranty that cover factor such non conformance to specification and defect in material and design the majority of our warranty are issued by our bca segment generally aircraft sale are accompanied by to year standard warranty for system accessory equipment part and software manufactured by or manufactured to certain standard under our authorization these warranty are included in the program estimate at completion on occasion we have made commitment beyond the

major warranty issue that exceed normal claim level estimated cost of these additional warranty issue are considered change to the initial liability estimate we provide guarantee to certain commercial airplane customer which include compensation provision for failure to meet specified aircraft performance target we account for these performance guarantee warranty the estimated liability for these warranty is based on known and anticipated operational characteristic and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance target and anticipated settlement when contractual remedy are not specified estimated payment are recorded reduction of revenue at delivery of the related aircraft we have agreement that require certain supplier to compensate for amount paid to customer for failure of supplied equipment to meet specified performance target claim against supplier under these agreement are included in inventory and recorded reduction in cost of product at delivery of the related aircraft these performance warranty and claim against supplier are included in the program estimate at completion supplier penaltieswe record an accrual for supplier penalty when an event occurs that make it probable that supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable until an event occurs we fully anticipate accepting all product procured under production related contract guaranteeswe record liability in accrued liability for the fair value of guarantee for credit guarantee the liability is equal to the present value of the expected loss we determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditor default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery if applicable at inception of
