metering or net metering available to solar customer net metering typically allows solar customer to interconnect their solar energy system to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchase by receiving bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid in certain jurisdiction regulator or utility have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so competition automotive the worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future we introduce additional vehicle in broader cross section of the passenger and commercial vehicle market and expand our vehicle capability we believe that our vehicle compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification well based on their propulsion technology for example model and model compete primarily with premium sedan and premium suv and model and model compete with small to medium sized sedan and compact suv which are extremely competitive market competing product typically include internal combustion vehicle from more established automobile manufacturer however many established and new automobile manufacturer have entered or have announced plan to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicle overall we believe these announcement and vehicle introduction promote the development of the electric vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of electric vehicle relative to the internal combustion vehicle many major automobile manufacturer have electric vehicle available today in major market including the china and europe and other current and prospective automobile manufacturer are also developing electric vehicle in addition several manufacturer offer hybrid vehicle including plug in version we also believe that there is increasing competition for our vehicle offering platform for delivering self driving technology charging solution and other feature and service and we expect to compete in this developing market through continued progress on our autopilot fsd and neural network capability supercharger network and our infotainment offering energy generation and storage energy storage system the market for energy storage product is also highly competitive and both established and emerging company have introduced product that are similar to our product portfolio or that are alternative to the element of our system we compete with these company based on price energy density and efficiency we believe that the specification and feature of our product our strong brand and the modular scalable nature of our energy storage product give competitive advantage in our market solar energy system the primary competitor to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility company that supply energy to our potential customer we compete with these traditional utility company primarily based on price and the ease by which customer can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy system we also compete with solar energy company that provide product and service similar to many solar energy company only install solar energy system while others only provide financing for these installation we believe we have significant expansion opportunity with our offering and that the regulatory environment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy system intellectual property we place strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary design which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio part of our business we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property right of these innovation and design such with respect to patent trademark copyright trade secret and other measure including through employee and third party nondisclosure agreement and other contractual arrangement for example we place high priority on obtaining patent to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovation and design within our product and technology in the electric vehicle market well to protect and defend our product portfolio we have also adopted patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate lawsuit against any party for infringing our patent through activity relating to electric vehicle or related equipment for so long such party is acting in good faith we made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of common rapidly evolving platform for electric vehicle thereby benefiting ourselves other company making electric vehicle and the world human capital resource of december our full time count for our and our subsidiary employee worldwide wa to date we have not experienced any work stoppage result of labor dispute and we consider our relationship with our employee to be good our key human capital objective in managing our business include attracting developing and retaining top talent while integrating diversity equity and inclusion principle and practice into our core value we want to attract pool of diverse and exceptional candidate and support their career growth once they become employee our effort begin at the entry level with development apprenticeship and internship program in local high school community college and four year college in addition we seek to hire based on talent rather than solely on educational pedigree and have provided thousand of job opening including in our local community for capable worker from various background to learn valuable skill in critical operation such in manufacturing vehicle service and energy product installation we also emphasize in our evaluation and career development effort internal mobility opportunity for employee to drive professional development our goal is long term upward bound career at tesla for every employee which we believe also drive our retention effort we also believe that our ability to retain our workforce is dependent on our ability to foster an environment that is sustainably safe respectful fair and inclusive of everyone and promotes diversity equity and inclusion inside and outside of our business from our outreach to historically black college and university and hispanic serving institution to sponsoring employee resource group across numerous location including asian pacific islander at tesla black at tesla intersectionality latino at tesla lgbtq at tesla veteran at tesla and woman in tesla we engage these network key business resource and source of actionable feedback we are also working on diversity effort in our supply chain to expand our outreach and support to small and large scale supplier from underrepresented community to emphasize this culture with our own employee available information we file or furnish periodic report and amendment thereto including our annual

information with the sec the information posted on our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form item risk factor you should carefully consider the risk described below together with the other information set forth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future result the risk described below are not the only risk facing our company risk and uncertainty not currently known to or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result risk related to our ability to grow our business we may be impacted by macroeconomic condition resulting from the global covid pandemic since the first quarter of there ha been worldwide impact from the covid pandemic government regulation and shifting social behavior have limited or closed non essential transportation government function business activity and person to person interaction in some case the relaxation of such trend ha recently been followed by actual or contemplated return to stringent restriction on gathering or commerce including in part of the and number of area in europe we temporarily suspended operation at each of our manufacturing facility worldwide for part of the first half of some of our supplier and partner also experienced temporary suspension before resuming including panasonic which manufacture battery cell for our product at our gigafactory nevada we also instituted temporary employee furlough and compensation reduction while our operation were scaled back reduced operation or closure at motor vehicle department vehicle auction house and municipal and utility company inspector have resulted in challenge in or postponement for our new vehicle delivery used vehicle sale and energy product deployment global trade condition and consumer trend may further adversely impact and our industry for example pandemic related issue have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdown and delay resulting in additional expense to expedite delivery of critical part similarly increased demand for personal electronics ha created shortfall of microchip supply and it is yet unknown we may be impacted sustaining our production trajectory will require the readiness and solvency of our supplier and vendor stable and motivated production workforce and ongoing government cooperation including for travel and visa allowance the contingency inherent in the construction of and ramp at new facility such gigafactory shanghai gigafactory berlin and gigafactory texas may be exacerbated by these challenge we can not predict the duration or direction of current global trend the sustained impact of which is largely unknown is rapidly evolving and ha varied across geographic region ultimately we continue to monitor macroeconomic condition to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business appropriate and we will have to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirement globally and deploy our production workforce and other resource accordingly if current global market condition continue or worsen or if we can not or do not maintain operation at scope that is commensurate with such condition or are later required to or choose to suspend such operation our business prospect financial condition and operating result may be harmed we may experience delay in launching and ramping the production of our product and feature or we may be unable to control our manufacturing cost we have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp delay for new product and feature for example we encountered unanticipated supplier issue that led to delay during the ramp of model and experienced challenge with supplier and with ramping full automation for certain of our initial model manufacturing process in addition we may introduce in the future new or unique manufacturing process and design feature for our product there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale such process or feature in particular our future business depends in large part on increasing the production of mass market vehicle including model and model which we are planning to achieve through multiple factory worldwide we have relatively limited experience to date in manufacturing model and model at high volume and even le experience building and ramping vehicle production line across multiple factory in different geography in order to be successful we will need to implement maintain and ramp efficient and cost effective manufacturing capability process and supply chain and achieve the design tolerance high quality and output rate we have planned at our manufacturing facility in california nevada texas china and germany we will also need to hire train and compensate skilled employee to operate these facility bottleneck and other unexpected challenge such those we experienced in the past may arise during our production ramp and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing process and reducing cost if we are not successful in achieving these goal we could face delay in establishing and or sustaining our model and model ramp or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability target we may also experience similar future delay in launching and or ramping production of our energy storage product and solar roof new product version or variant new vehicle such tesla semi cybertruck and the new tesla roadster and future feature and service such new autopilot or fsd feature and the autonomous tesla ride hailing network likewise we may encounter delay with the design construction and regulatory or other approval necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing facility and product any delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current product or the development manufacture launch and production ramp of our future product feature and service or in so cost effectively and with high quality may harm our brand business prospect financial condition and operating result we may be unable to grow our global product sale delivery and installation capability and our servicing and vehicle charging network or we may be unable to accurately project and effectively manage our growth our success will depend on our ability to continue to expand our sale capability we also frequently adjust our retail operation and product offering in order to optimize our reach cost product line up and model differentiation and customer experience however there is no guarantee that such step will be accepted by consumer accustomed to traditional sale strategy for example marketing method such touchless test drive that we have pioneered in certain market have not been proven at scale we are targeting with model and model global mass demographic with broad range of potential customer in which we have relatively limited experience projecting demand and pricing our product we currently produce numerous international variant at limited number of factory and if our specific demand expectation for these variant prove inaccurate we may not be able to timely generate delivery matched to the vehicle that we produce in the timeframe or that are commensurate with the size of our operation in given region likewise we develop and grow our energy product and service worldwide our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecast demand in various market we do not have independent dealer network we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicle to our customer while we have improved our delivery logistics we may face difficulty with delivery at increasing volume particularly in international market requiring significant transit time for example we saw challenge in ramping our logistics channel in china and europe to initially deliver model there in the first quarter of we have deployed number of delivery model such delivery to customer home and workplace and touchless delivery but there is no guarantee that such model will be scalable or be accepted globally likewise we ramp solar roof we are working to substantially increase installation personnel and decrease installation time if we are not successful in matching such capability with actual production or if we experience unforeseen production delay or inaccurately forecast demand for the solar roof our business financial condition and operating result may be harmed moreover because of our unique expertise with our vehicle we recommend that our vehicle be serviced by or by certain authorized professional if we experience delay in adding such servicing capacity or servicing our vehicle efficiently or experience unforeseen issue with the reliability of our vehicle particularly higher volume and newer addition to our fleet such model and model it could overburden our servicing capability and part inventory similarly the increasing number of tesla vehicle also requires to continue to rapidly increase the number of our supercharger station and connector throughout the world there is no assurance that we will be able to ramp our business to meet our sale delivery installation servicing and vehicle charging target globally that our projection on which such target are based will prove accurate or that the pace of growth or coverage of our customer infrastructure network will meet customer expectation these plan require significant cash investment and management resource and there is no guarantee that they will generate additional sale or installation of our product or that we will be able to avoid cost overrun or be able to hire additional personnel to support them we expand we will also need to ensure our compliance with regulatory requirement in various jurisdiction applicable to the sale installation and servicing of our product the sale or dispatch of electricity related to our energy product and the operation of supercharger if we fail to manage our growth effectively it may harm our brand business prospect financial condition and operating result our future growth and success are dependent upon consumer demand for electric vehicle and specifically our vehicle in an automotive industry that is generally competitive cyclical and volatile if the market for electric vehicle in general and tesla vehicle in particular doe not develop we expect develops more slowly than we expect or if demand for our vehicle decrease in our market or our vehicle compete with each other our business prospect financial condition and operating result may be harmed we are still at an earlier stage and have limited resource and production relative to established competitor that offer internal combustion engine vehicle in addition electric vehicle still comprise small percentage of overall vehicle sale result the market for our vehicle could be negatively affected by numerous factor such perception about electric vehicle feature quality safety performance and cost perception about the limited range over which electric vehicle may be driven on single battery charge and access to charging facility competition including from other type of alternative fuel vehicle plug in hybrid electric vehicle and high fuel economy internal combustion engine vehicle volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline such wide fluctuation in crude oil price during government regulation and economic incentive and concern about our future viability finally the target demographic for our vehicle particularly model and model are highly competitive sale of vehicle in the automotive industry tend to be cyclical in many market which may expose to further volatility we expand and adjust our operation and retail strategy moreover the covid pandemic may negatively impact the transportation and automotive industry long term it is uncertain to how such macroeconomic factor will impact company that ha been experiencing growth and increasing market share in an industry that ha globally been experiencing recent decline in sale our supplier may fail to deliver component according to schedule price quality and volume that are acceptable to or we may be unable to manage these component effectively our product contain thousand of part that we purchase globally from hundred of mostly single source direct supplier generally without long term supply agreement this expose to multiple potential source of component shortage such those that we experienced in and with our model and model ramp unexpected change in business condition material pricing labor issue war governmental change tariff natural disaster such the march earthquake in japan health epidemic such the global covid pandemic trade and shipping disruption and other factor beyond our or our supplier control could also affect these supplier ability to deliver component to or to remain solvent and operational for example global shortage of microchip ha been reported since early and the impact to is yet unknown the unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delay idle manufacturing facility product design change and loss of access to important technology and tool for producing and supporting our product moreover significant increase in our production such for model and model or product design change by have required and may in the future require to procure additional component in short amount of time our supplier may not be willing or able to sustainably meet our timeline or our cost quality and volume need or to do so may cost more which may require to replace them with other source finally we have limited vehicle manufacturing experience outside of the fremont factory and we may experience issue increasing the level of localized procurement at our gigafactory shanghai and at future factory such gigafactory berlin and gigafactory texas while we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate source or develop our own replacement for most of our component there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all additionally we may be unsuccessful in our continuous effort to negotiate with existing supplier to obtain cost reduction and avoid unfavorable change to term source le expensive supplier for certain part and redesign certain part to make them le expensive to produce any of these occurrence may harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result the scale of our vehicle production increase we will also need to accurately forecast purchase warehouse and transport component at high volume to our manufacturing facility and servicing location internationally if we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantity of component purchase to our actual need or successfully implement automation inventory management and other system to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain and part management we may incur unexpected production disruption storage transportation and write off cost which may harm our business and operating result we may be unable to meet our projected construction timeline cost and production ramp at new factory or we may experience difficulty in generating and maintaining demand for product manufactured there our ability to increase production of our vehicle on sustained basis make them affordable globally by accessing local supply chain and workforce and streamline delivery logistics is dependent on the construction and ramp of gigafactory shanghai gigafactory berlin and gigafactory texas the construction of and commencement and ramp of production at these factory are subject to number of uncertainty inherent in all new manufacturing operation including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirement procurement and maintenance of construction environmental and operational license and approval for additional expansion potential supply chain constraint hiring training and retention of qualified employee and the pace of bringing production equipment and process online with the capability to manufacture high quality unit at scale for example we are currently constructing gigafactory berlin under conditional permit moreover we intend to incorporate sequential design and manufacturing change into vehicle manufactured at each new factory we have limited experience to date with developing and implementing vehicle manufacturing innovation outside of the fremont factory we only recently began production at gigafactory shanghai in particular the majority of our design and engineering resource are currently located in california in order to meet our expectation for our new factory we must expand and manage localized design and engineering talent and resource if we experience any issue or delay in meeting our projected timeline cost capital efficiency and production capacity for our new factory expanding and managing team to implement iterative design and production change there maintaining and complying with the term of any debt financing that we obtain to fund them or generating and maintaining demand for the vehicle we manufacture there our business prospect operating result and financial condition may be harmed we will need to maintain and significantly grow our access to battery cell including through the development and manufacture of our own cell and control our related cost we are dependent on the continued supply of lithium ion battery cell for our vehicle and energy storage product and we will require substantially more cell to grow our business according to our plan currently we rely on supplier such panasonic for these cell however we have to date fully qualified only limited number of such supplier and have limited flexibility in changing supplier any disruption in the supply of battery cell from our supplier could limit production of our vehicle and energy storage product in the long term we intend to supplement cell from our supplier with cell manufactured by which we believe will be more efficient manufacturable at greater volume and cost effective than currently available cell however our effort to develop and manufacture such battery cell have required and may require significant investment and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these target in the timeframes that we have planned or at all if we are unable to do so we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy storage product production or procure additional cell from supplier at potentially greater cost either of which may harm our business and operating result in addition the cost of battery cell whether manufactured by our supplier or by depends in part upon the price and availability of raw material such lithium nickel cobalt and or other metal the price for these material fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable depending on market condition and global demand for these material including result of increased global production of electric vehicle and energy storage product any reduced availability of these material may impact our access to cell and any increase in their price may reduce our profitability if we can not recoup the increased cost through increased vehicle price moreover any such attempt to increase product price may harm our brand prospect and operating result we face strong competition for our product and service from growing list of established and new competitor the worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future for example model and model face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturer in the extremely competitive entry level premium sedan and compact suv market significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturer well other company have entered or are reported to have plan to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicle including hybrid plug in hybrid and fully electric vehicle well the market for self driving technology and other vehicle application and software platform in some case our competitor offer or will offer electric vehicle in important market such china and europe and or have announced an intention to produce electric vehicle exclusively at some point in the future many of our competitor have significantly greater or better established resource than we do to devote to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their product increased competition could result in our lower vehicle unit sale price reduction revenue shortfall loss of customer and loss of market share which may harm our business financial condition and operating result we also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturer developer installers and service provider of competing energy system well from large utility decrease in the retail or wholesale price of electricity from utility or other renewable energy source could make our product le attractive to customer and lead to an increased rate of residential customer default under our existing long term lease and ppas risk related to our operation we may experience issue with lithium ion cell or other component manufactured at gigafactory nevada which may harm the production and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage product our plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage product depends on significant lithium ion battery cell production by our partner panasonic at gigafactory nevada although panasonic ha long track record of producing high quality cell at significant volume at it factory in japan it ha relatively limited experience with cell production at gigafactory nevada which began in moreover although panasonic is co located with at gigafactory nevada it is free to make it own operational decision such it determination to temporarily suspend it manufacturing there in response to the covid pandemic in addition we produce several vehicle component such battery module and pack incorporating the cell produced by panasonic for model and model and drive unit including to support gigafactory shanghai production at gigafactory nevada and we also manufacture energy storage product there in the past some of the manufacturing line for certain product component took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity and additional bottleneck may arise in the future we continue to increase the production rate and introduce new line if we or panasonic are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operation at gigafactory nevada production or if we are unable to do so cost effectively or hire and retain highly skilled personnel there our ability to manufacture our product profitably would be limited which may harm our business and operating result finally the high volume of lithium ion cell and battery module and pack manufactured at gigafactory nevada are stored and recycled at our various facility any mishandling of battery cell may cause disruption to the operation of such facility while we have implemented safety procedure related to the handling of the cell there can be no assurance that safety issue or fire related to the cell would not disrupt our operation any such disruption or issue may harm our brand and business we face risk associated with maintaining and expanding our international operation including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory political economic tax and labor condition we are subject to legal and regulatory requirement political uncertainty and social environmental and economic condition in numerous jurisdiction over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable our operation in such jurisdiction particularly company based in the create risk relating to conforming our product to regulatory and safety requirement and charging and other electric infrastructure organizing local operating entity establishing staffing and managing foreign business location attracting local customer navigating foreign government tax regulation and permit requirement enforceability of our contractual right trade restriction custom regulation tariff and price or exchange control and preference in foreign nation for domestically manufactured product such condition may increase our cost impact our ability to sell our product and require significant management attention and may harm our business if we unable to manage them effectively our business may suffer if our product or feature contain defect fail to perform expected or take longer than expected to become fully functional if our product contain design or manufacturing defect that cause them not to perform expected or that require repair or certain feature of our vehicle such new autopilot or fsd feature take longer than expected to become enabled are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation our ability to develop market and sell our product and service may be harmed and we may experience delivery delay product recall product liability breach of warranty and consumer protection claim and significant warranty and other expense in particular our product are highly dependent on software which is inherently complex and may contain latent defect or error or be subject to external attack issue experienced by our customer have included those related to the model and model inch display screen the panoramic roof and the volt battery in the model the seat and door in the model and the operation of solar panel installed by although we attempt to remedy any issue we observe in our product effectively and rapidly possible such effort may not be timely may hamper production or may not completely satisfy our customer while we have performed extensive internal testing on our product and feature we currently have limited frame of reference by which to evaluate their long term quality reliability durability and performance characteristic there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defect in our product prior to their sale to or installation for customer we may be required to defend or insure against product liability claim the automobile industry generally experience significant product liability claim and such we face the risk of such claim in the event our vehicle do not perform or are claimed to not have performed expected is true for other automaker our vehicle have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in accident resulting in death or personal injury and such accident where autopilot or fsd feature are engaged are the subject of significant public attention we have experienced and we expect to continue to face claim arising from or related to misuse or claimed failure of such new technology that we are pioneering in addition the battery pack that we produce make use of lithium ion cell on rare occasion lithium ion cell can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flame in manner that can ignite nearby material well other lithium ion cell while we have designed our battery pack to passively contain any single cell release of energy without spreading to neighboring cell there can be no assurance that field or testing failure of our vehicle or other battery pack that we produce will not occur in particular due to high speed crash likewise our solar energy system and energy storage product generate and store electricity they have the potential to fail or cause injury to people or property any product liability claim may subject to lawsuit and substantial monetary damage product recall or redesign effort and even meritless claim may require to defend it all of which may generate negative publicity and be expensive and time consuming in most jurisdiction we generally self insure against the risk of product liability claim for vehicle exposure meaning that any product liability claim will likely have to be paid from company fund and not by insurance we will need to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long term business prospect in order to succeed in order to maintain and grow our business we must maintain credibility and confidence among customer supplier analyst investor rating agency and other party in our long term financial viability and business prospect maintaining such confidence may be challenging due to our limited operating history relative to established competitor customer unfamiliarity with our product any delay we may experience in scaling manufacturing delivery and service operation to meet demand competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicle or our other product and service our quarterly production and sale performance compared with market expectation and other factor including those over which we have no control in particular tesla product business result of operation statement and action are well publicized by range of third party such attention includes frequent criticism which is often exaggerated or unfounded such speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team any such negative perception whether caused by or not may harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional fund if needed we may be unable to effectively grow or manage the compliance residual value financing and credit risk related to our various financing program we offer financing arrangement for our vehicle in north america europe and asia primarily through various financial institution we also currently offer vehicle financing arrangement directly through our local subsidiary in certain market depending on the country such arrangement are available for specified model and may include operating lease directly with under which we typically receive only very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease followed by stream of payment over the term of the lease we have also offered various arrangement for customer of our solar energy system whereby they pay fixed payment to lease or finance the purchase of such system or purchase electricity generated by them if we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national state and or local financial regulation and consumer protection law governing these transaction we may become subject to enforcement action or penalty the profitability of any directly leased vehicle returned to at the end of their lease depends on our ability to accurately project our vehicle residual value at the outset of the lease and such value may fluctuate prior to the end of their term depending on various factor such supply and demand of our used vehicle economic cycle and the pricing of new vehicle we have made in the past and may make in the future certain adjustment to our price from time to time in the ordinary course of business which may impact the residual value of our vehicle and reduce the profitability of our vehicle leasing program the funding and growth of this program also relies on our ability to secure adequate financing and or business partner if we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program through internal fund partner or other financing source and compelling alternative financing program are not available for our customer who may expect or need such option we may be unable to grow our vehicle delivery furthermore if our vehicle leasing business grows substantially our business may suffer if we can not effectively manage the resulting greater level of residual risk similarly we have provided resale value guarantee to vehicle customer and partner for certain financing program under which such counterparties may sell their vehicle back to at certain point in time at pre determined amount however actual resale value are subject to fluctuation over the term of the financing arrangement such from the vehicle pricing change discussed if the actual resale value of any vehicle resold or returned to pursuant to these program are materially lower than the pre determined amount we have offered our financial condition and operating result may be harmed finally our vehicle and solar energy system financing program and our energy storage sale program also expose to customer credit risk in the event of widespread economic downturn or other catastrophic event our customer may be unable or unwilling to satisfy their payment obligation to on timely basis or at all if significant number of our customer default we may incur substantial credit loss and or impairment charge with respect to the underlying asset we must manage ongoing obligation under our agreement with the research foundation for the state university of new york relating to our gigafactory new york we are party to an operating lease and research and development agreement through the suny foundation these agreement provide for the construction and use of our gigafactory new york which we have primarily used for the development and production of our solar roof and other solar product and component energy storage component and supercharger component and for other lessor approved function under this agreement we are obligated to among other thing meet employment target well specified minimum number of personnel in the state of new york and in buffalo new york and spend or incur billion in combined capital operational expense cost of good sold and other cost in the state of new york during the year period beginning april we temporarily suspended most of our manufacturing operation at gigafactory new york pursuant to new york state executive order issued in march result of the covid pandemic we were granted one year deferral of our obligation to be compliant with our applicable target under such agreement on april which wa memorialized in an amendment to our agreement with the suny foundation in july while we expect to have and grow significant operation at gigafactory new york and the surrounding buffalo area any failure by in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet all applicable future obligation may result in our obligation to pay program payment of million to the suny foundation for such year the termination of our lease at gigafactory new york which may require to pay additional penalty and or the need to adjust certain of our operation in particular our production ramp of the solar roof or other component any of the foregoing event may harm our business financial condition and operating result if we are unable to attract hire and retain key employee and qualified personnel our ability to compete may be harmed the loss of the service of any of our key employee or any significant portion of our workforce could disrupt our operation or delay the development introduction and ramp of our product and service in particular we are highly dependent on the service of elon musk our chief executive officer none of our key employee is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business our future success also depends upon our ability to attract hire and retain large number of engineering manufacturing marketing sale and delivery service installation technology and support personnel especially to support our planned high volume product sale market and geographical expansion and technological innovation recruiting effort particularly for senior employee may be time consuming which may delay the execution of our plan if we are not successful in managing these risk our business financial condition and operating result may be harmed employee may leave tesla or choose other employer over tesla due to various factor such very competitive labor market for talented individual with automotive or technology experience or any negative publicity related to in california nevada and other region where we have operation there is increasing competition for individual with skillsets needed for our business including specialized knowledge of electric vehicle software engineering manufacturing engineering and electrical and building construction expertise moreover we may be impacted by perception relating to reduction in force that we have conducted in the past in order to optimize our organizational structure and reduce cost and the departure of certain senior personnel for various reason likewise result of our temporary suspension of various manufacturing operation in the first half of in april we temporarily furloughed certain hourly employee and reduced most salaried employee base salary we also compete with both mature and prosperous company that have far greater financial resource than we do and start ups and emerging company that promise short term growth opportunity finally our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origin with an emphasis on equity based award and benefit in order to closely align their incentive with the long term interest of our stockholder we periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholder for future increase to the number of award available under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plan if we are unable to obtain the requisite stockholder approval for such future increase we may have to expend additional cash to compensate our employee and our ability to retain and hire qualified personnel may be harmed we are highly dependent on the service of elon musk our chief executive officer we are highly dependent on the service of elon musk our chief executive officer and largest stockholder although mr musk spends significant time with tesla and is highly active in our management doe not devote full time and attention to tesla mr musk also currently serf chief executive officer and chief technical officer of space exploration technology corp developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicle and is involved in other emerging technology venture we must manage risk relating to our information technology system and the threat of intellectual property theft data breach and cyber attack we must continue to expand and improve our information technology system our operation grow such product data management procurement inventory management production planning and execution sale service and logistics dealer management financial tax and regulatory compliance system this includes the implementation of new internally developed system and the deployment of such system in the and abroad we must also continue to maintain information technology measure designed to protect against intellectual property theft data breach sabotage and other external or internal cyber attack or misappropriation however the implementation maintenance segregation and improvement of these system require significant management time support and cost and there are inherent risk associated with developing improving and expanding our core system well implementing new system and updating current system including disruption to the related area of business operation these risk may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory procure part or supply or manufacture sell deliver and service product adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with or realize available benefit under tax law and other applicable regulation moreover if we do not successfully implement maintain or expand these system planned our operation may be disrupted our ability to accurately and or timely report our financial result could be impaired and deficiency may arise in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact our ability to certify our financial result moreover our proprietary information or intellectual property could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected if these system or their functionality do not operate we expect them to we may be required to expend significant resource to make correction or find alternative source for performing these function any unauthorized control or manipulation of our product system could result in loss of confidence in and our product our product contain complex information technology system for example our vehicle and energy storage product are designed with built in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote update from to improve or update their functionality while we have implemented security measure intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology network our product and their system malicious entity have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such network product and system to gain control of or to change our product functionality user interface and performance characteristic or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our product we encourage reporting of potential vulnerability in the security of our product through our security vulnerability reporting policy and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability however there can be no assurance that any vulnerability will not be exploited before they can be identified or that our remediation effort are or will be successful any unauthorized access to or control of our product or their system or any loss of data could result in legal claim or government investigation in addition regardless of their veracity report of unauthorized access to our product their system or data well other factor that may result in the perception that our product their system or data are capable of being hacked may harm our brand prospect and operating result we have been the subject of such report in the past our business may be adversely affected by any disruption caused by union activity it is not uncommon for employee of certain trade at company such to belong to union which can result in higher employee cost and increased risk of work stoppage moreover regulation in some jurisdiction outside of the mandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreement and work council with certain consultation right with respect to the relevant company operation although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employee they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form labor union or we may be required to become union signatory from time to time labor union have engaged in campaign to organize certain of our operation part of which such union have filed unfair labor practice charge against with the national labor relation board and they may do so in the future in september an administrative law judge issued recommended decision for tesla on certain issue and against on certain others the national labor relation board ha not yet adopted the recommendation and we have appealed certain aspect of the recommended decision any unfavorable ultimate outcome for tesla may have negative impact on the perception of tesla treatment of our employee furthermore we are directly or indirectly dependent upon company with unionized work force such supplier and trucking and freight company any work stoppage or strike organized by such union could delay the manufacture and sale of our product and may harm our business and operating result we may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recall or take other similar action manufacturing company we must manage the risk of product recall with respect to our product recall for our vehicle have resulted from for example industry wide issue with airbags from particular supplier concern of corrosion in model and model power steering assist motor bolt certain suspension failure in model and model and issue with model and model medium control unit in addition to recall initiated by for various cause testing of or investigation into our product by government regulator or industry group may compel to initiate product recall or may result in negative public perception about the safety of our product even if we disagree with the defect determination or have data that show the actual safety risk to be non existent in the future we may voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recall if any of our product are determined by or regulator to contain safety defect or be noncompliant with applicable law and regulation such federal motor vehicle safety standard such recall whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by system or component engineered or manufactured by or our supplier could result in significant expense supply chain complication and service burden and may harm our brand business prospect financial condition and operating result our current and future warranty reserve may be insufficient to cover future warranty claim we provide manufacturer warranty on all new and used tesla vehicle we sell we also provide certain warranty with respect to the energy generation and storage system we sell including on their installation and maintenance and for component not manufactured by we generally pas through to our customer the applicable manufacturer warranty part of our energy generation and storage system contract we may provide the customer with performance guarantee that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or other energy performance requirement specified in the contract under these performance guarantee we bear the risk of electricity production or other performance shortfall even if they result from failure in component from third party manufacturer these risk are exacerbated in the event such manufacturer cease operation or fail to honor their warranty if our warranty reserve are inadequate to cover future warranty claim on our product our financial condition and operating result may be harmed warranty reserve include our management best estimate of the projected cost to repair or to replace item under warranty which are based on actual claim incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and cost of future claim such estimate are inherently uncertain and change to our historical or projected experience especially with respect to product such model model and solar roof that we have recently introduced and or that we expect to produce at significantly greater volume than our past product may cause material change to our warranty reserve in the future our insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect from all business risk we may be subject in the ordinary course of business to loss resulting from product liability accident act of god and other claim against for which we may have no insurance coverage general matter we do not maintain much insurance coverage many other company do and in some case we do not maintain any at all additionally the policy that we do have may include significant deductible or self insured retention policy limitation and exclusion and we can not be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future loss or claim against loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limit may require to pay substantial amount which may harm our financial condition and operating result there is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness or that we will not incur additional indebtedness of december we and our subsidiary outstanding billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness see note debt to the consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form our substantial consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry condition we and our subsidiary may subject to the limitation in the term of our existing and future indebtedness incur additional debt secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt holder of convertible senior note issued by or our subsidiary may convert such note at their option prior to the scheduled maturity of the respective convertible senior note under certain circumstance pursuant to the term of such note upon conversion of the applicable convertible senior note we will be obligated to deliver cash and or share pursuant to the term of such note for example our stock price ha significantly increased recently we have seen higher level of early conversion of such in the money convertible senior note moreover holder of such convertible senior note may have the right to require to repurchase their note upon the occurrence of fundamental change pursuant to the term of such note our ability to make scheduled payment of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due to make payment upon conversion or repurchase demand with respect to our convertible senior note or to refinance our indebtedness we may need or desire depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factor beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operation in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligation under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditure if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternative such reducing or delaying investment or capital expenditure selling asset refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on term that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital market and our financial condition at such time in addition our ability to make payment may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreement governing our future indebtedness we may not be able to engage in these activity on desirable term or at all which may result in default on our existing or future indebtedness and harm our financial condition and operating result our debt agreement contain covenant restriction that may limit our ability to operate our business the term of certain of our credit facility including our senior asset based revolving credit agreement contain and any of our other future debt agreement may contain covenant restriction that limit our ability to operate our business including restriction on our ability to among other thing incur additional debt or issue guarantee create lien repurchase stock or make other restricted payment and make certain voluntary prepayment of specified debt in addition under certain circumstance we are required to comply with fixed charge coverage ratio result of these covenant our ability to respond to change in business and economic condition and engage in beneficial transaction including to obtain additional financing needed may be restricted furthermore our failure to comply with our debt covenant could result in default under our debt agreement which could permit the holder to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient fund available to repay it additional fund may not be available to when we need or want them our business and our future plan for expansion are capital intensive and the specific timing of cash inflow and outflow may fluctuate substantially from period to period we may need or want to raise additional fund through the issuance of equity equity related or debt security or through obtaining credit from financial institution to fund together with our principal source of liquidity the cost of developing and manufacturing our current or future product to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expense or for new significant strategic investment or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness even if not required to do so by the term of such indebtedness we can not be certain that additional fund will be available to on favorable term when required or at all if we can not raise additional fund when we need them our financial condition result of operation business and prospect could be materially and adversely affected we may be negatively impacted by any early obsolescence of our manufacturing equipment we depreciate the cost of our manufacturing equipment over their expected useful life however product cycle or manufacturing technology may change periodically and we may decide to update our product or manufacturing process more quickly than expected moreover improvement in engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency may result in our ability to manufacture our product using le of our currently installed equipment alternatively we ramp and mature the production of our product to higher level we may discontinue the use of already installed equipment in favor of different or additional equipment the useful life of any equipment that would be retired early result would be shortened causing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated and our result of operation may be harmed we hold and may acquire digital asset that may be subject to volatile market price impairment and unique risk of loss in january we updated our investment policy to provide with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize return on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity part of the policy which wa duly approved by the audit committee of our board of director we may invest portion of such cash in certain alternative reserve asset including digital asset gold bullion gold exchange traded fund and other asset specified in the future thereafter we invested an aggregate billion in bitcoin under this policy and may acquire and hold digital asset from time to time or long term moreover we expect to begin accepting bitcoin form of payment for our product in the near future subject to applicable law and initially on limited basis which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt the price of digital asset have been in the past and may continue to be highly volatile including result of various associated risk and uncertainty for example the prevalence of such asset is relatively recent trend and their long term adoption by investor consumer and business is unpredictable moreover their lack of physical form their reliance on technology for their creation existence and transactional validation and their decentralization may subject their integrity to the threat of malicious attack and technological obsolescence finally the extent to which security law or other regulation apply or may apply in the future to such asset is unclear and may change in the future if we hold digital asset and their value decrease relative to our purchase price our financial condition may be harmed moreover digital asset are currently considered indefinite lived intangible asset under applicable accounting rule meaning that any decrease in their fair value below our carrying value for such asset at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require to recognize impairment charge whereas we may make no upward revision for any market price increase until sale which may adversely affect our operating result in any period in which such impairment occurs moreover there is no guarantee that future change in gaap will not require to change the way we account for digital asset held by finally intangible asset without centralized issuer or governing body digital asset have been and may in the future be subject to security breach cyberattacks or other malicious activity well human error or computer malfunction that may result in the loss or destruction of private key needed to access such asset while we intend to take all reasonable measure to secure any digital asset if such threat are realized or the measure or control we create or implement to secure our digital asset fail it could result in partial or total misappropriation or loss of our digital asset and our financial condition and operating result may be harmed we are exposed to fluctuation in currency exchange rate we transact business globally in multiple currency and have foreign currency risk related to our revenue cost of revenue operating expense and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currency other than the dollar currently primarily the chinese yuan euro canadian dollar and british pound to the extent we have significant revenue denominated in such foreign currency any strengthening of the dollar would tend to reduce our revenue measured in dollar we have historically experienced in addition portion of our cost and expense have been and we anticipate will continue to be denominated in foreign currency including the chinese yuan and japanese yen if we do not have fully offsetting revenue in these currency and if the value of the dollar depreciates significantly against these currency our cost measured in dollar percent of our revenue will correspondingly increase and our margin will suffer moreover while we undertake limited hedging activity intended to offset the impact of currency translation exposure it is impossible to predict or eliminate such impact result our operating result may be harmed we may need to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claim which may be time consuming and expensive our competitor or other third party may hold or obtain patent copyright trademark or other proprietary right that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use develop sell or market our product and service which could make it more difficult for to operate our business from time to time the holder of such intellectual property right may assert their right and urge to take license and or may bring suit alleging infringement or misappropriation of such right which could result in substantial cost negative publicity and management attention regardless of merit while we endeavor to obtain and protect the intellectual property right that we expect will allow to retain or advance our strategic initiative there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately identify and protect the portion of intellectual property that are strategic to our business or mitigate the risk of potential suit or other legal demand by our competitor accordingly we may consider the entering into licensing agreement with respect to such right although no assurance can be given that such license can be obtained on acceptable term or that litigation will not occur and such license and associated litigation could significantly increase our operating expense in addition if we are determined to have or believe there is high likelihood that we have infringed upon third party intellectual property right we may be required to cease making selling or incorporating certain component or intellectual property into the good and service we offer to pay substantial damage and or license royalty to redesign our product and service and or to establish and maintain alternative branding for our product and service in the event that we are required to take one or more such action our brand business financial condition and operating result may be harmed our operation could be adversely affected by event outside of our control such natural disaster war or health epidemic we may be impacted by natural disaster war health epidemic or other event outside of our control for example our corporate headquarters the fremont factory and gigafactory nevada are located in seismically active region in northern california and nevada and our gigafactory shanghai is located in flood prone area if major disaster such earthquake flood or other event occur or our information system or communication network break or operates improperly our headquarters and production facility may be seriously damaged or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our product in addition the global covid pandemic ha impacted economic market manufacturing operation supply chain employment and consumer behavior in nearly every geographic region and industry across the world and we have been and may in the future be adversely affected result we may incur expense or delay relating to such event outside of our control which could have material adverse impact on our business operating result and financial condition risk related to government law and regulation demand for our product and service may be impacted by the status of government and economic incentive supporting the development and adoption of such product government and economic incentive that support the development and adoption of electric vehicle in the and abroad including certain tax exemption tax credit and rebate may be reduced eliminated or exhausted from time to time for example federal tax credit that wa available in the for the purchase of our vehicle wa reduced in phase during and ultimately ended in we believe that this sequential phase out likely pulled forward some vehicle demand into the period preceding each reduction moreover previously available incentive favoring electric vehicle in area including ontario canada germany hong kong denmark and california have expired or were cancelled or temporarily unavailable and in some case were not eventually replaced or reinstituted which may have negatively impacted sale any similar development could have some negative impact on demand for our vehicle and we and our customer may have to adjust to them in addition certain governmental rebate tax credit and other financial incentive that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy storage product business allow to lower our cost and encourage customer to buy our product and investor to invest in our solar financing fund however these incentive may expire when the allocated funding is exhausted reduced or terminated renewable energy adoption rate increase sometimes without warning for example the federal government currently offer certain tax credit for the installation of solar power facility and energy storage system that are charged from co sited solar power facility however these tax credit are currently scheduled to decline and or expire in and beyond likewise in jurisdiction where net metering is currently available our customer receive bill credit from utility for energy that their solar energy system generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use the benefit available under net metering ha been or ha been proposed to be reduced altered or eliminated in several jurisdiction and ha also been contested and may continue to be contested before the ferc any reduction or termination of such incentive may harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result by making our product le competitive for potential customer increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partner and to form new financing fund for our solar and energy storage asset finally we and our fund investor claim these federal tax credit and certain state incentive in amount based on independently appraised fair market value of our solar and energy storage system nevertheless the relevant governmental authority have audited such value and in certain case have determined that these value should be lower and they may do so again in the future such determination may result in adverse tax consequence and or our obligation to make indemnification or other payment to our fund or fund investor we are subject to evolving law and regulation that could impose substantial cost legal prohibition or unfavorable change upon our operation or product we grow our manufacturing operation in additional region we are or will be subject to complex environmental manufacturing health and safety law and regulation at numerous jurisdictional level in the china germany and other location abroad including law relating to the use handling storage recycling disposal and or human exposure to hazardous material product material input and post consumer product and with respect to constructing expanding and maintaining our facility the cost of compliance including remediation of any discovered issue and any change to our operation mandated by new or amended law may be significant and any failure to comply could result in significant expense delay or fine we are also subject to law and regulation applicable to the supply manufacture import sale and service of automobile both domestically and abroad for example in country outside of the we are required to meet standard relating to vehicle safety fuel economy and emission that are often materially different from requirement in the thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicle and system to ensure regulatory compliance in those country this process may include official review and certification of our vehicle by foreign regulatory agency prior to market entry well compliance with foreign reporting and recall management system requirement in particular we offer in our vehicle autopilot and fsd feature that today assist driver with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspect of road travel but which currently require driver to remain fully engaged in the driving operation we are continuing to develop our fsd technology with the goal of achieving full self driving capability in the future there are variety of international federal and state regulation that may apply to self driving vehicle which include many existing vehicle standard that were not originally intended to apply to vehicle that may not have driver such regulation continue to rapidly change which increase the likelihood of patchwork of complex or conflicting regulation or may delay product or restrict self driving feature and availability which could adversely affect our business finally manufacturer installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage system and supplier of electricity generated and stored by the solar energy and energy storage system we install for customer we are impacted by federal state and local regulation and policy concerning electricity pricing the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electric grid and the sale of electricity generated by third party owned system if regulation and policy that adversely impact the interconnection or use of our solar and energy storage system are introduced they could deter potential customer from purchasing our solar and energy storage product threaten the economics of our existing contract and cause to cease solar and energy storage system sale and operation in the relevant jurisdiction which may harm our business financial condition and operating result any failure by to comply with variety of and international privacy and consumer protection law may harm any failure by or our vendor or other business partner to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal state or international privacy data protection or security law or regulation relating to the processing collection use retention security and transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigation related action against legal liability fine damage ongoing audit requirement and other significant cost substantial expense and operational change may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such law and in particular certain emerging privacy law are still subject to high degree of uncertainty to their interpretation and application for example in may the general data protection regulation began to fully apply to the processing of personal information collected from individual located in the european union and ha created new compliance obligation and significantly increased fine for noncompliance similarly of january the california consumer privacy act imposes certain legal obligation on our use and processing of personal information related to california resident finally new privacy and cybersecurity law are coming into effect in china notwithstanding our effort to protect the security and integrity of our customer personal information we may be required to expend significant resource to comply with data breach requirement if for example third party improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customer or we otherwise experience data loss with respect to customer personal information major breach of our network security and system may result in fine penalty and damage and harm our brand prospect and operating result we could be subject to liability penalty and other restrictive sanction and adverse consequence arising out of certain governmental investigation and proceeding we are cooperating with certain government investigation discussed in note commitment and contingency to the consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form to our knowledge no government agency in any such ongoing investigation ha concluded that any wrongdoing occurred however we can not predict the outcome or impact of any such ongoing matter and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability penalty and other restrictive sanction and adverse consequence if the sec the department of justice or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future moreover we expect to incur cost in responding to related request for information and subpoena and if instituted in defending against any governmental proceeding for example on october the district court for the southern district of new york entered final judgment approving the term of settlement filed with the court on september in connection with the action taken by the sec relating to mr musk statement on august that he wa considering taking tesla private pursuant to the settlement we among other thing paid civil penalty of million appointed an independent director the chair of our board of director appointed two additional independent director to our board of director and made further enhancement to our disclosure control and other corporate governance related matter on april this settlement wa amended to clarify certain of the previously agreed disclosure procedure which wa subsequently approved by the court all other term of the prior settlement were reaffirmed without modification although we intend to continue to comply with the term and requirement of the settlement if there is lack of compliance or an alleged lack of compliance additional enforcement action or other legal proceeding may be instituted against we may face regulatory challenge to or limitation on our ability to sell vehicle directly while we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sale strategy including sale through our website we may not be able to sell our vehicle through our own store in certain state in the with law that may be interpreted to impose limitation on this direct to consumer sale model it ha also been asserted that the law in some state limit our ability to obtain dealer license from state motor vehicle regulator and such assertion persist in certain location decision by regulator permitting to sell vehicle have been and may be challenged by dealer association and others to whether such decision comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry law we have prevailed in many of these lawsuit and such result have reinforced our continuing belief that state law were not intended to apply to manufacturer that doe not have franchise dealer in some state there have also been regulatory and legislative effort by dealer association to propose law that if enacted would prevent from obtaining dealer license in their state given our current sale model few state have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate but at the same time limit the number of dealer license we can obtain or store that we can operate the application of state law applicable to our operation continues to be difficult to predict internationally there may be law in jurisdiction we have not yet entered or law we are unaware of in jurisdiction we have entered that may restrict our sale or other business practice even for those jurisdiction we have analyzed the law in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time continued regulatory limitation and other obstacle interfering with our ability to sell vehicle directly to consumer may harm our financial condition and operating result risk related to the ownership of our common stock the trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile the trading price of our common stock ha been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuation in response to various factor some of which are beyond our control our common stock ha experienced over the last week an intra day trading high of per share and low of per share adjusted to give effect to the reflect the five for one stock split effected in the form of stock dividend in august the stock split the stock market in general and the market for technology company in particular ha experienced extreme price and volume fluctuation that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those company in particular large proportion of our common stock ha been historically and may in the future be traded by short seller which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock further influencing volatility in it market price public perception and other factor outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of company like that garner disproportionate degree of public attention regardless of actual operating performance in addition in the past following period of volatility in the overall market or the market price of our share security class action litigation ha been filed against while we defend such action vigorously any judgment against or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of our management attention and resource our financial result may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuation in our operating cost and other factor we expect our period to period financial result to vary based on our operating cost which we anticipate will fluctuate the pace at which we continue to design develop and manufacture new product and increase production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facility and adding future facility may not be consistent or linear period additionally our revenue from period to period may fluctuate we introduce existing product to new market for the first time and we develop and introduce new product result of these factor we believe that quarter to quarter comparison of our financial result especially in the short term are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparison can not be relied upon indicator of future performance moreover our financial result may not meet expectation of equity research analyst rating agency or investor who may be focused only on short term quarterly financial result if any of this occurs the trading price of our stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time we may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectation about our business which could cause our stock price to decline we may provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance correctly identifying key factor affecting business condition and predicting future event is inherently an uncertain process and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate and ha in the past been inaccurate in certain respect such the timing of new product manufacturing ramp our guidance is based on certain assumption such those relating to anticipated production and sale volume which generally are not linear throughout given period average sale price supplier and commodity cost and planned cost reduction if our guidance varies from actual result due to our assumption not being met or the impact on our financial performance that could occur result of various risk and uncertainty the market value of our common stock could decline significantly transaction relating to our convertible senior note may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholder or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock the conversion of some or all of the convertible senior note issued by or our subsidiary would dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholder to the extent we deliver share upon conversion of any of such note by their holder and we may be required to deliver significant number of share any sale in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect their prevailing market price in addition the existence of the convertible senior note may encourage short selling by market participant because the conversion of such note could be used to satisfy short position or the anticipated conversion of such note into share of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock moreover in connection with certain of the convertible senior note we entered into convertible note hedge transaction which are expected to reduce the potential dilution and or offset potential cash payment we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the applicable note we also entered into warrant transaction with the hedge counterparties which could separately have dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrant on the applicable expiration date in addition the hedge counterparties or their affiliate may enter into various transaction with respect to their hedge position which could also affect the market price of our common stock or the convertible senior note if elon musk were forced to sell share of our common stock that he ha pledged to secure certain personal loan obligation such sale could cause our stock price to decline certain banking institution have made extension of credit to elon musk our chief executive officer portion of which wa used to purchase share of common stock in certain of our public offering and private placement at the same price offered to third party participant in such offering and placement we are not party to these loan which are partially secured by pledge of portion of the tesla common stock currently owned by mr musk if the price of our common stock were to decline substantially mr musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institution to sell share of tesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligation if he could not do so through other mean any such sale could cause the price of our common stock to decline further anti takeover provision contained in our governing document applicable law and our convertible senior note could impair takeover attempt our certificate of incorporation and bylaw afford certain right and power to our board of director that may facilitate the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable we are also subject to section of the delaware general corporation law and other provision of delaware law that limit the ability of stockholder in certain situation to effect certain business combination in addition the term of our convertible senior note may require to repurchase such note in the event of fundamental change including takeover of our company any of the foregoing provision and term that ha the effect of delaying or deterring change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholder to receive premium for their share of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investor are willing to pay for our common stock item unresolved staff comment none item property we are headquartered in palo alto california our principal facility include large number of property in north america europe and asia

contingency to the consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form in addition each of the matter below is being disclosed pursuant to item of regulation because it relates to environmental regulation and aggregate civil penalty that could potentially exceed million we believe that any proceeding that is material to our business or financial condition is likely to have potential penalty far in excess of such amount the bay area air quality management district baaqmd ha issued notice of violation to relating to air permitting and related compliance for the fremont factory but ha not initiated formal proceeding we have disputed certain of these allegation and have asserted that there ha been no related adverse community or environmental impact while we

issued our subsidiary in germany notice and fine in the amount of million euro alleging it non compliance under applicable law relating to market participation notification and take back obligation with respect to end of life battery product required thereunder this is primarily relating to administrative requirement but tesla ha continued to take back battery pack and although we can not predict the outcome of this matter including the final amount of any penalty we have filed our objection and it is not expected to have material adverse impact on our business we have also received

congestion and intermittent supplier shutdown and delay resulting in additional expense to expedite delivery of critical part similarly increased demand for personal electronics ha created shortfall of microchip supply and it is yet unknown how we may be impacted please see the result of operation section of this item below and certain risk factor described in part item risk factor in this annual report on form particularly the first risk factor included there for more detailed description of the impact and risk to our business we can not predict the duration or direction of current global trend from this pandemic the sustained impact of which is largely unknown is rapidly evolving and ha varied across geographic region ultimately we continue to monitor macroeconomic condition to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business appropriate and we will have to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirement globally and deploy our production workforce and other resource accordingly automotive production the following is summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle model in production and under development of the date of this annual report on form production location vehicle model production status fremont factory model and model active model and model active gigafactory shanghai model and model active gigafactory berlin model constructing manufacturing facility gigafactory texas model constructing manufacturing facility cybertruck in development tbd tesla semi in development tesla roadster in development we recently announced updated version of model and model featuring redesigned powertrain and other improvement in we are focused on ramping these model on new manufacturing equipment well production rate of model and model to at least the capacity that we have installed the next phase of production growth will depend on the construction of gigafactory berlin and gigafactory texas each of which is progressing planned for delivery beginning in our goal is to continuously decrease production cost and increase the affordability of our vehicle we are continuing to develop and manufacture our own battery cell with which we are targeting high volume output lower capital and production cost and longer range cell supply is critical to our business coupling this strategy with cell from our supplier will help stay ahead of any potential constraint however these plan are subject to uncertainty inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operation which may be exacerbated by the number of concurrent international project and any future impact from event outside of our control such the covid pandemic and any industry wide component constraint moreover we must meet ambitious technological target with our plan for battery cell well for iterative manufacturing and design improvement for our vehicle with each new factory automotive demand and sale our cost reduction effort and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicle affordability and for example have allowed to competitively price our vehicle in china in addition to opening new factory in we will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicle functionality including autopilot fsd and software feature and introducing anticipated future vehicle moreover we expect to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing environmental awareness however we operate in cyclical industry that is sensitive to trade environmental and political uncertainty all of which may also be compounded by any future global impact from the covid pandemic on the other hand there have been recent sign of recovery from competitor that experienced downturn in meaning that we will have to continue to execute well to maintain the momentum that we have gained relative to an ever growing competitive landscape automotive delivery and customer infrastructure our delivery increase we must work constantly to prevent our vehicle delivery capability from becoming bottleneck on our total delivery situating our factory closer to local market should mitigate the strain on our delivery in any case we expand we will have to continue to increase and staff our delivery servicing and charging infrastructure maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our supercharger location to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction in particular we remain focused on increasing the capability and efficiency of our servicing operation energy generation and storage demand production and deployment the long term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margin through greater volume we continue to increase the production of our energy storage product to meet high level of demand for powerwall better availability and growing grid stability concern drive higher interest and cross selling with our residential solar energy product will continue to benefit both product line we remain committed to increasing our retrofit solar energy business by offering low cost and simplified online ordering experience in addition we are working to improve our installation capability for solar roof by on boarding and training large number of installers and reducing the installation time dramatically these product line grow we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage product and hire additional personnel particularly skilled electrician to support the ramp of solar roof cash flow and capital expenditure trend our capital expenditure are typically difficult to project beyond the short term given the number and breadth of our core project at any given time and uncertainty in future global market condition resulting from the covid pandemic currently make projection more challenging we are simultaneously ramping new product in the new model and model model and solar roof constructing or ramping manufacturing facility on three continent and piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technology and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among project the pace at which we meet milestone production adjustment to and among our various product increased capital efficiency and the addition of new project owing and subject to the foregoing well the pipeline of announced project under development and all other continuing infrastructure growth we currently expect our capital expenditure to be to billion in and each of the next two fiscal year our business ha recently been consistently generating cash flow from operation in excess of our level of capital spend and with better working capital management resulting in shorter day sale outstanding than day payable outstanding our sale growth is also facilitating positive cash generation on the other hand we are likely to see heightened level of capital expenditure during certain period depending on the specific pace of our capital intensive project moreover our stock price ha significantly increased recently we have seen higher level of early conversion of in the money convertible senior note which obligates to deliver cash and or share pursuant to the term of those note overall we expect our ability to be self funding to continue long macroeconomic factor support current trend in our sale we also opportunistically strengthened our liquidity further through an at the market offering of common stock in december with net proceeds to of approximately billion operating expense trend long we see expanding sale and excluding the potential impact of non cash stock compensation expense attributable to the ceo performance award and impairment charge on certain asset explained below we generally expect operating expense relative to revenue to decrease we additionally increase operational efficiency and process automation in march our stockholder approved performance based stock option award to our ceo the ceo performance award consisting of vesting tranche contingent on the achievement of specified market capitalization and operational milestone we incur non cash stock based compensation expense for each tranche only after the related operational milestone initially becomes probable of being met based on subjective assessment of our future financial performance and if this happens following the grant date we record at such time cumulative catch up expense that may be significant based on the length of time elapsed from the grant date moreover the remaining expense for that tranche is ratably recorded over the period remaining until the later of the expected achievement of the relevant operational milestone if it ha not yet been achieved and ii the expected achievement of the related market capitalization milestone if it ha not yet been achieved upon vesting of tranche all remaining associated expense is recognized immediately because the expected market capitalization achievement are generally later than the related expected operational milestone achievement the achievement of the former earlier than expected may increase the magnitude of any catch up expense and or accelerate the rate at which the remaining expense is recognized during several operational milestone became probable and several tranche vested including result of our market capitalization increasing rapidly resulting in the recognition or acceleration of related expense earlier than anticipated and within relatively short period of time see note equity incentive plan ceo performance award to the consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form for further detail regarding the stock based compensation relating to the ceo performance award our market capitalization is unpredictable and our financial performance improves it is possible that the earlier than planned recognition of such expense will continue in the near term in january we updated our investment policy to provide with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize return on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity part of the policy we may invest portion of such cash in certain specified alternative reserve asset thereafter we invested an aggregate billion in bitcoin under this policy moreover we expect to begin accepting bitcoin form of payment for our product in the near future subject to applicable law and initially on limited basis which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt digital asset are considered indefinite lived intangible asset under applicable accounting rule accordingly any decrease in their fair value below our carrying value for such asset at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require to recognize impairment charge whereas we may make no upward revision for any market price increase until sale we currently intend to hold these asset long term these charge may negatively impact our profitability in the period in which such impairment occur even if the overall market value of these asset increase critical accounting policy and estimate the consolidated financial statement are prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the gaap the preparation of the consolidated financial statement requires to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue cost and expense and related disclosure we base our estimate on historical experience appropriate and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance change in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual result could differ significantly from the estimate made by our management we evaluate our estimate and assumption on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material difference between these estimate and actual result our future financial statement presentation financial condition result of operation and cash flow may be affected due to the covid pandemic there ha been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial market the estimate used for but not limited to determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangement sale return reserve the collectability of account receivable inventory valuation fair value of long lived asset goodwill fair value of financial instrument fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicle and solar energy system subject to lease could be impacted we have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that required an update to our estimate and assumption or materially affected the carrying value of our asset or liability of the date of issuance of this annual report on form these estimate may change new event occur and additional information is obtained actual result could differ materially from these estimate under different assumption or condition revenue recognition automotive segment automotive sale revenue automotive sale without resale value guarantee automotive sale revenue includes revenue related to delivery of new vehicle and pay per use charge and specific other feature and service that meet the definition of performance obligation under asc including access to our supercharger network internet connectivity fsd feature and over the air software update we recognize revenue on automotive sale upon delivery to the customer which is when the control of vehicle transfer payment are typically received at the point control transfer or in accordance with payment term customary to the business other feature and service such access to our supercharger network internet connectivity and over the air software update are provisioned upon control transfer of vehicle and recognized over time on straight line basis we have stand ready obligation to deliver such service to the customer we recognize revenue related to these other feature and service over the performance period which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eight year life of the vehicle revenue related to fsd feature is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer for our obligation related to automotive sale we estimate standalone selling price by considering cost used to develop and deliver the service third party pricing of similar option and other information that may be available at the time of revenue recognition we reduce the transaction price and record sale return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product return based on historical experience in addition any fee that are paid or payable by to customer lender when we arrange the financing are recognized an offset against automotive sale revenue cost to obtain contract mainly relate to commission paid to our sale personnel for the sale of vehicle commission are not paid on other obligation such access to our supercharger network internet connectivity fsd feature and over the air software update our contract cost related to automotive sale are typically fulfilled within one year the cost to obtain contract are expensed incurred amount billed to customer related to shipping and handling are classified automotive sale revenue and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicle part or accessory have transferred to the customer an expense in cost of automotive sale revenue our policy is to exclude tax collected from customer from the transaction price of automotive contract automotive sale with resale value guarantee or buyback option we offer resale value guarantee or similar buy back term to certain international customer who purchase vehicle and who finance their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partner we also offer resale value guarantee in connection with automotive sale to certain leasing partner under these program we receive full payment for the vehicle sale price at the time of delivery and our counterparty ha the option of selling their vehicle back to during the guarantee period which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program for pre determined resale value with the exception of the vehicle sale to leasing partner with resale value guarantee and buyback option program discussed within the automotive leasing section below we recognize revenue when control transfer upon delivery to customer in accordance with asc sale with right of return we do not believe the customer ha significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception the process to determine whether there is significant economic incentive includes comparison of vehicle estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer economic incentive to exercise the performance obligation and the pattern of recognizing automotive sale with resale value guarantee are consistent with automotive sale without resale value guarantee with the exception of our estimate for sale return reserve sale return reserve for automotive sale with resale value guarantee are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market value on quarterly basis we ass the estimated market value of vehicle under our buyback option program to determine whether there have been change to the likelihood of future product return we accumulate more data related to the buyback value of our vehicle or market condition change there may be material change to their estimated value automotive regulatory credit we earn tradable credit in the operation of our automotive business under various regulation related to zevs greenhouse gas fuel economy and clean fuel we sell these credit to other regulated entity who can use the credit to comply with emission standard and other regulatory requirement payment for automotive regulatory credit are typically received at the point control transfer to the customer or in accordance with payment term customary to the business we recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credit at the time control of the regulatory credit is transferred to the purchasing party automotive sale revenue in the consolidated statement of operation automotive leasing revenue direct vehicle operating leasing program we have outstanding lease under our direct vehicle operating leasing program in the canada and in certain country in europe qualifying customer are permitted to lease vehicle directly from tesla for up to month at the end of the lease term customer are required to return the vehicle to or for model and model lease in certain region may opt to purchase the vehicle for pre determined residual value we account for these leasing transaction operating lease we record leasing revenue to automotive leasing revenue on straight line basis over the contractual term and we record the depreciation of these vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue our policy is to exclude tax collected from customer from the transaction price of automotive contract vehicle sale to leasing partner with resale value guarantee and buyback option we offered buyback option in connection with automotive sale with resale value guarantee with certain leasing partner sale in the and where we expected the customer had significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception we continued to recognize these transaction operating lease these transaction entailed transfer of lease which we had originated with an end customer to our leasing partner control of the vehicle had not been transferred in accordance with asc these transaction were accounted for interest bearing collateralized borrowing in accordance with asc lease prior to january under this program cash wa received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value wa generally recorded within resale value guarantee and the customer upfront down payment wa recorded within deferred revenue we amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on straight line basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate we capitalized vehicle under this program to operating lease vehicle net on the consolidated balance sheet and we record depreciation from these vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under lease arrangement cash received for these vehicle net of revenue recognized during the period is classified collateralized lease repayment borrowing within cash flow from financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flow with the adoption of asc on january all new agreement under this program are accounted for operating lease under asc and there wa no material change in the timing and amount of revenue recognized over the term consequently any cash flow for new agreement are classified operating cash activity on the consolidated statement of cash flow at the end of the lease term we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or paying shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle any remaining balance within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue the end customer can extend the lease for period of up to month in case where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue direct sale type leasing program we have outstanding direct lease and vehicle financed by under loan arrangement accounted for sale type lease under asc in certain country in asia and europe which we introduced in volume during the third quarter of depending on the specific program customer may or may not have right to return the vehicle to during or at the end of the lease term if the customer doe not have right to return the customer will take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payment under the program for which there is right to return the purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payment qualifying customer are permitted to lease vehicle directly under these program for up to month our loan arrangement under these program can have term for up to month we recognize all revenue and cost associated with the sale type lease automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue respectively upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time customer are invoiced on monthly basis energy generation and storage segment energy generation and storage sale energy generation and storage sale revenue consists of the sale of solar energy system and energy storage system to residential small commercial and large commercial and utility grade customer including solar subscription based arrangement energy generation and storage sale revenue also includes revenue from agreement for solar energy system and ppas that commence after january which is recognized earned based on the amount of capacity provided for solar energy system or electricity delivered for ppas at the contractual billing rate assuming all other revenue recognition criterion have been met under the practical expedient available under asc we recognize revenue based on the value of the service which is consistent with the billing amount sale of solar energy system to residential and small scale commercial customer consist of the engineering design and installation of the system post installation residential and small scale commercial customer receive proprietary monitoring system that capture and display historical energy generation data residential and small scale commercial customer pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfer which is when we install solar energy system and the system pass inspection by the utility or the authority jurisdiction revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably stand ready obligation over the warranty period of the solar energy system sale of energy storage system to residential and small scale commercial customer consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfer which is when the product ha been delivered or if we are performing installation when installed and commissioned payment for such storage system is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment term customary to the business for large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sale which consist of the engineering design and installation of the system customer make milestone payment that are consistent with contract specific phase of project revenue from such contract is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred percentage of total estimated contract cost for energy storage system sale and percentage of total estimated labor hour for solar energy system sale certain large scale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sale also include operation and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contract and are thus considered to be combined contract with the design and installation service for certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system where the percentage of completion method doe not apply revenue is recognized when control transfer which is when the product ha been delivered to the customer and commissioned for energy storage system and when the project ha received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy system operation and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term for solar energy system sale and upon delivery of the service for energy storage system sale customer payment for such service are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance in instance where there are multiple performance obligation in single contract we allocate the consideration to the various obligation in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method standalone selling price are estimated based on estimated cost plus margin or by using market data for comparable product cost incurred on the sale of residential installation before the solar energy system are completed are included work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheet any fee that are paid or payable by to solar loan lender would be recognized an offset against revenue cost to obtain contract relate mainly to commission paid to our sale personnel related to the sale of solar energy system and energy storage system our contract cost related to solar energy system and energy storage system sale are typically fulfilled within one year the cost to obtain contract are expensed incurred part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contract we may provide the customer with performance guarantee that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or energy performance requirement specified in the contract in certain instance we may receive bonus payment if the system performs above specified level conversely if solar energy system or energy storage system doe not meet the performance guarantee requirement we may be required to pay liquidated damage other form of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contract include variable customer payment that will be made based on our energy market participation activity such guarantee and variable customer payment represent form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period additional performance data becomes available such estimate are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable significant reversal of revenue will not occur we record deferred revenue any non refundable amount that are collected from customer related to fee charged for prepayment and remote monitoring service and operation and maintenance service which is recognized revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term energy generation and storage leasing for revenue arrangement where we are the lessor under operating lease agreement for energy generation and storage product we record lease revenue from minimum lease payment including upfront rebate and incentive earned from such system on straight line basis over the life of the lease term assuming all other revenue recognition criterion have been met the difference between the payment received and the revenue recognized is recorded deferred revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet for solar energy system where customer purchase electricity from under ppas prior to january we have determined that these agreement should be accounted for operating lease pursuant to asc revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rate specified under the contract assuming all other revenue recognition criterion are met we record deferred revenue any amount that are collected from customer including lease prepayment in excess of revenue recognized and operation and maintenance service fee which is recognized revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebate and incentive received from utility company and various local and state government agency which is recognized revenue over the lease term we capitalize initial direct cost from the execution of agreement for solar energy system and ppas which include the referral fee and sale commission an element of solar energy system net and subsequently amortize these cost over the term of the related agreement inventory valuation inventory are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is computed using standard cost for vehicle and energy storage product which approximates actual cost on first in first out basis in addition cost for solar energy system is recorded using actual cost we record inventory write down for excess or obsolete inventory based upon assumption about current and future demand forecast if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amount are written off we also review our inventory to determine whether it carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicle le the estimated cost to convert the inventory on hand into finished product once inventory is written down new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent change in fact and circumstance do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis should our estimate of future selling price or production cost change additional and potentially material increase to this reserve may be required small change in our estimate may result in material charge to our reported financial result warranty we provide manufacturer warranty on all new and used vehicle and warranty on the installation and component of the energy generation and storage system we sell for period typically between to year we accrue warranty reserve for the product sold by which includes our best estimate of the projected cost to repair or replace item under warranty and recall when identified these estimate are based on actual claim incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and cost of future claim these estimate are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sale and change to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material change to the warranty reserve in the future the warranty reserve doe not include projected warranty cost associated with our vehicle subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy system under lease contract or ppas the cost to repair these warranty claim are expensed incurred the portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next month is included within accrued liability and other while the remaining balance is included within other long term liability on the consolidated balance sheet warranty expense is recorded component of cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operation stock based compensation we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock option and restricted stock unit rsus granted to employee and for our employee stock purchase plan the espp to measure the cost of employee service received in exchange for the stock based award the fair value of stock option award with only service and or performance condition is estimated on the grant or offering date using the black scholes option pricing model the black scholes option pricing model requires input such the risk free interest rate expected term and expected volatility these input are subjective and generally require significant judgment the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period which is generally four year for stock option and rsus and six month for the espp stock based compensation expense is recognized on straight line basis net of actual forfeiture in the period for performance based award stock based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestone when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable for performance based award with vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market condition stock based compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and ii the expected achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being achieved if such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date we will recognize cumulative catch up expense from the grant date to that point in time if the related market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than it expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone the stock based compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized if additional operational milestone become probable stock based compensation expense will be recorded in the period it becomes probable including cumulative catch up expense for the service provided since the grant date the fair value of such award is estimated on the grant date using monte carlo simulation we accumulate additional employee stock based award data over time and we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatility and expected life which could materially impact the valuation of our stock based award and the stock based compensation expense that we will recognize in future period stock based compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenue research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operation income tax we are subject to tax in the and in many foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income tax our deferred tax asset and liability and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax asset we make these estimate and judgment about our future taxable income that are based on assumption that are consistent with our future plan tax law regulation and administrative practice may be subject to change due to economic or political condition including fundamental change to the tax law applicable to corporate multinationals the many country in the european union and number of other country are actively considering change in this regard of december we had recorded full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset because we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax asset will not be realized should the actual amount differ from our estimate the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax position in the ordinary course of business there are many transaction and calculation for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attribute or tax payable based on our estimate of the eventual outcome these effect are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return position are supportable we believe that it is likely that some of those position may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authority we are required to file income tax return in the and various foreign jurisdiction which requires to interpret the applicable tax law and regulation in effect in such jurisdiction such return are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authority who may disagree with respect to our tax position we believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit year based on our assessment of many factor including past experience and interpretation of tax law we review and update our estimate in light of changing fact and circumstance such the closing of tax audit the lapse of statute of limitation or change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matter differs from our expectation such difference may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax asset in the period that such determination is made principle of consolidation the consolidated financial statement reflect our account and operation and those of our subsidiary in which we have controlling financial interest in accordance with the provision of asc consolidation we consolidate any variable interest entity vie of which we are the primary beneficiary we form vies with our financing fund investor in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attribute associated with our solar energy system and lease under our direct vehicle leasing program the typical condition for controlling financial interest ownership is holding majority of the voting interest of an entity however controlling financial interest may also exist in entity such vies through arrangement that do not involve controlling voting interest asc requires variable interest holder to consolidate vie if that party ha the power to direct the activity of the vie that most significantly impact the vie economic performance and the obligation to absorb loss of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefit from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie we do not consolidate vie in which we have majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the vies we evaluate our relationship with all the vies on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary all intercompany transaction and balance have been eliminated upon consolidation noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest represent third party interest in the net asset under certain funding arrangement or fund that we enter into to finance the cost of solar energy system and vehicle under operating lease we have determined that the contractual provision of the fund represent substantive profit sharing arrangement we have further determined that the methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balance that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangement is balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value hlbv method we therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest in the net asset of the fund at each balance sheet date using the hlbv method which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet noncontrolling interest in subsidiary and redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiary under the hlbv method the amount reported noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amount the third party would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provision of the fund assuming the net asset of the fund were liquidated at their recorded amount determined in accordance with gaap and with tax law effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third party the third party interest in the result of operation of the fund are determined the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balance in the consolidated balance sheet between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transaction between the fund and the third party however the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third party have the right to redeem their interest in the fund for cash or other asset for certain fund there may be significant fluctuation in net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiary due to change in the liquidation provision time based milestone are reached result of operation effect of covid the covid pandemic impacted our business and financial result in the temporary suspension of production at our factory during the first half of caused production limitation that together with reduced or closed government and third party partner operation in the year negatively impacted our delivery and deployment in while we resumed operation at all of our factory worldwide our temporary suspension at our factory resulted in idle capacity charge we still incurred fixed cost such depreciation certain payroll related expense and property tax part of our response strategy to the business disruption and uncertainty around macroeconomic condition caused by the covid pandemic we instituted cost reduction initiative across our business globally to be commensurate to the scope of our operation while they were scaled back in the first half of this included temporary labor cost reduction measure such employee furlough and compensation reduction additionally we suspended non critical operating spend and opportunistically renegotiated supplier and vendor arrangement part of various governmental response to the pandemic granted to company globally we received certain payroll related benefit which helped to reduce the impact of the covid pandemic on our financial result such payroll related benefit related to our direct headcount have been primarily netted against our disclosed idle capacity charge and they marginally reduced our operating expense the impact of the idle capacity charge incurred during the first half of were almost entirely offset by our cost saving initiative and payroll related benefit revenue year ended december change change dollar in million automotive sale automotive leasing total automotive revenue service and other total automotive service and other segment revenue energy generation and storage segment revenue total revenue automotive service and other segment automotive sale revenue includes revenue related to cash delivery of new model model model and model vehicle including access to our supercharger network internet connectivity fsd feature and over the air software update well sale of regulatory credit to other automotive manufacturer cash delivery are vehicle that are not subject to lease accounting our revenue from regulatory credit fluctuates depending on when contract is executed with buyer and when the credit are delivered automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicle under direct operating lease agreement well those sold with resale value guarantee accounted for operating lease under lease accounting we began offering direct leasing for model vehicle in the second quarter of and we began offering direct leasing for model vehicle in the third quarter of additionally automotive leasing revenue includes direct sale type leasing program where we recognize all revenue associated with the sale type lease upon delivery to the customer which we introduced in volume during the third quarter of service and other revenue consists of non warranty after sale vehicle service sale of used vehicle retail merchandise sale by our acquired subsidiary to third party customer and vehicle insurance revenue compared to automotive sale revenue increased billion or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december primarily due to an increase of model and model cash delivery despite production limitation result of temporary suspension of production at the fremont factory and gigafactory nevada during the first half of we were able to increase delivery year over year from production ramping at both gigafactory shanghai and the fremont factory there wa also an increase of million from additional sale of regulatory credit to billion in the year ended december additionally due to pricing adjustment we made to our vehicle offering during the year ended december we estimated that there wa greater likelihood that customer would exercise their buyback option and adjusted our sale return reserve on vehicle previously sold under our buyback option program which resulted in reduction of automotive sale revenue of million we made further pricing adjustment that resulted in similar but smaller reduction of automotive sale revenue of million during the year ended december the smaller reduction in revenue from pricing adjustment resulted in positive impact to automotive sale revenue of million year over year these factor increasing automotive sale revenue were partially offset by decrease in the combined average selling price of model and model despite the inclusion of higher priced model delivery in the combined average selling price of model and model decreased due to higher proportion of model standard range variant in our sale mix compared to the prior year additionally there wa decrease in automotive sale revenue from fewer model and model cash delivery at relatively consistent combined average selling price in the year ended december compared to the prior year automotive leasing revenue increased million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicle under our direct operating lease program and the

automotive sale with resale value guarantee automotive regulatory credit energy generation and storage sale service and other total revenue from sale and service automotive leasing energy generation and storage leasing total revenue due to pricing adjustment we made to our vehicle offering during and we estimated that there wa greater likelihood that customer would exercise their buyback option and adjusted our sale return reserve on vehicle previously sold under our buyback option program which resulted in reduction of automotive sale with resale value guarantee for the year ended december and price adjustment resulted in reduction of automotive sale with resale value guarantee by million and million respectively the amount presented represent automotive sale with resale value guarantee

buyback option that were provided prior to such adjustment result along with the estimated variable consideration related to normal future product return for vehicle sold under the buyback option program we adjusted our sale return reserve on vehicle previously sold under our buyback option program resulting in reduction of automotive sale revenue of million for the year ended december if

the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy system maintenance cost associated with those system and amortization of any initial direct cost lease we adopted asc lease of january using the cumulative effect adjustment approach adoption of the new lease standard in addition we elected the package of practical expedient permitted under the transition

authority accrued interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit are classified income tax expense the tax cut and job act tcja subject shareholder to tax on global intangible low taxed income gilti earned by certain foreign subsidiary under gaap we can make an accounting policy election to either treat tax due on the gilti inclusion current period expense or factor such amount into our measurement of deferred tax we elected the deferred method under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax asset and liability on our consolidated balance sheet currently subject to valuation allowance comprehensive income loss comprehensive income loss is comprised of net income loss and other comprehensive income loss other comprehensive income loss consists of foreign currency translation adjustment that have been excluded from the determination of net income loss stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for cost related to all share based payment including stock option restricted stock unit rsus and our employee stock purchase plan the espp the fair value of stock option award with only service and or performance condition is estimated on the grant or offering date using the black scholes option pricing model the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock stock based compensation expense is recognized on straight line basis over the requisite service period net of actual forfeiture in the period for performance based award stock based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestone when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable for performance based award with vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market condition stock based compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and ii the expected achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being achieved if such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date we will recognize cumulative catch up expense from the grant date to that point in time if the related market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than it expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone then the stock based compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized the fair value of such award is estimated on the grant date using monte carlo simulation see note equity incentive plan we accumulate additional employee stock based award data over time and we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatility and expected life which could materially impact the valuation of our stock based award and the stock based compensation expense that we will recognize in future period stock based compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenue research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operation noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest represent third party interest in the net asset under certain funding arrangement or fund that we enter into to finance the cost of solar energy system and vehicle under operating lease we have determined that the contractual provision of the fund represent substantive profit sharing arrangement we have further determined that the methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balance that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangement is balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value hlbv method we therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest in the net asset of the fund at each balance sheet date using the hlbv method which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet noncontrolling interest in subsidiary and redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiary under the hlbv method the amount reported noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amount the third party would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provision of the fund assuming the net asset of the fund were liquidated at their recorded amount determined in accordance with gaap and with tax law effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third party the third party interest in the result of operation of the fund are determined the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balance in the consolidated balance sheet between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transaction between the fund and the third party however the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third party have the right to redeem their interest in the fund for cash or other asset for certain fund there may be significant fluctuation in the ending balance of redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiary and net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiary due to change in the liquidation provision time based milestone are reached net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholder basic net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholder is calculated by dividing net income loss attributable to common stockholder by the weighted average share of common stock outstanding for the period during the year ended december we decreased net income attributable to common stockholder by million to arrive at the numerator used to calculate net income per share during the year ended december we increased net loss attributable to common stockholder by million to arrive at the numerator used to calculate net loss per share these adjustment represent the difference between the cash we paid to the financing fund investor for their noncontrolling interest in our subsidiary and the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest on our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with asc earnings per share potentially dilutive share which are based on the weighted average share of common stock underlying outstanding stock based award warrant and convertible senior note using the treasury stock method or the if converted method applicable are included when calculating diluted net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholder when their effect is dilutive since we intend to settle or have settled in cash the principal outstanding under our convertible senior note due in note convertible senior note due in note convertible senior note due in note note and our subsidiary convertible senior note due in we use the treasury stock method applied using our average share price during the period when calculating their potential dilutive effect if any furthermore in connection with the offering of our convertible senior note we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant see note debt however our convertible note hedge are not included when calculating

and any noncontrolling interest is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable asset acquired and the liability assumed we recognize bargain purchase gain within other income expense net on the consolidated statement of operation if the net fair value of the identifiable asset acquired and the liability assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interest we include the result of operation of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statement beginning on the acquisition date cash and cash equivalent all highly liquid investment with an original maturity of three month or le at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalent our cash equivalent are primarily comprised of money market fund restricted cash we

company offering various financing product to our customer sale of energy generation and storage product sale of regulatory credit to other automotive manufacturer government rebate already passed through to customer and maintenance service on vehicle owned by leasing company we provide an allowance against account receivable for the amount we expect to be uncollectible we write off account receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible depending on the day of the week on which the end of fiscal quarter fall our account receivable balance may fluctuate we are waiting for certain customer payment to clear through our banking institution and receipt of payment from our financing partner which can take up to approximately two week based on the contractual payment term with such partner our account receivable balance associated with our sale of regulatory credit which are typically transferred to other manufacturer during the last few day of the quarter is dependent on contractual payment term additionally government rebate can take up to year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timeline of the specific jurisdiction issuing them these various factor may have significant impact on our account receivable balance from period to period mypower customer note receivable we have customer note receivable under the legacy mypower loan program mypower wa offered by one of our subsidiary to provide residential customer with the option to finance the purchase of solar energy system through year loan the outstanding balance net of any allowance for credit loss are presented on the consolidated balance sheet component of prepaid expense and other current asset for the current portion and other non current asset for the long term portion we adopted asc financial instrument credit loss on january on modified retrospective basis under asc expected credit loss for customer note receivable are measured on collective basis and are determined the difference between the amortized cost basis and the present value of cash flow expected to be collected in determining expected credit loss we consider our historical level of credit loss current economic trend and reasonable and supportable forecast that affect the collectability of the future cash flow we write off customer note receivable when they are deemed uncollectible and the amount of potentially uncollectible amount ha been insignificant using modified retrospective approach for the impact upon adoption we recorded an increase to the allowance for credit loss of million on january with an offset to accumulated deficit of december and the total outstanding balance of mypower customer note receivable net of allowance for credit loss wa million and million respectively of which million wa due in the next month of december and respectively of december the allowance for credit loss wa million in addition there were no material non accrual or past due customer note receivable of december concentration of risk credit risk financial instrument that potentially subject to concentration of credit risk consist of cash cash equivalent restricted cash account receivable convertible note hedge and interest rate swap our cash balance are primarily invested in money market fund or on deposit at high credit quality financial institution in the these deposit are typically in excess of insured limit of december and no entity represented or more of our total account receivable balance the risk of concentration for our convertible note hedge and interest rate swap is mitigated by transacting with several highly rated multinational bank supply risk we are dependent on our supplier the majority of which are single source supplier and the inability of these supplier to deliver necessary component of our product in timely manner at price quality level and volume acceptable to or our inability to efficiently manage these component from these supplier could have material adverse effect on our business prospect financial condition and operating result although all of our manufacturing facility are operational and we continue to increase our output and add additional capacity and are working with each of our supplier and government agency on meeting ramping and sustaining our production our ability to sustain this trajectory depends among other thing on the readiness and solvency of our supplier and vendor through any macroeconomic factor resulting from the covid pandemic inventory valuation inventory are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is computed using standard cost for vehicle and energy storage product which approximates actual cost on first in first out basis in addition cost for solar energy system is recorded using actual cost we record inventory write down for excess or obsolete inventory based upon assumption about current and future demand forecast if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amount are written off we also review our inventory to determine whether it carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicle le the estimated cost to convert the inventory on hand into finished product once inventory is written down new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent change in fact and circumstance do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis should our estimate of future selling price or production cost change additional and potentially material increase to this reserve may be required small change in our estimate may result in material charge to our reported financial result operating lease vehicle vehicle that are leased part of our direct vehicle leasing program and vehicle delivered to leasing partner with resale value guarantee and buyback option where there is significant economic incentive to exercise at contract inception are classified operating lease vehicle the related revenue transaction are treated operating lease under asc refer to the automotive leasing revenue section above for detail operating lease vehicle are recorded at cost le accumulated depreciation we generally depreciate their value le salvage value using the straight line method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the contractual period the gross cost of operating lease vehicle of december and wa billion and billion respectively operating lease vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet are presented net of accumulated depreciation of million and million of december and respectively solar energy system net we are the lessor of solar energy system prior to january these lease were accounted for operating lease in accordance with asc under asc to determine lease classification we evaluated the lease term to determine whether there wa transfer of ownership or bargain purchase option at the end of the lease whether the lease term wa greater than of the useful life or whether the present value of the minimum lease payment exceeded of the fair value at lease inception agreement for solar energy system lease and ppas that commence after january no longer meet the definition of lease upon the adoption of asc and are instead accounted for in accordance with asc we utilize periodic appraisal to estimate useful life and fair value at lease inception and residual value at lease termination solar energy system are stated at cost le accumulated depreciation depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the respective asset follows solar energy system in service to year initial direct cost related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition cost lease term up to year solar energy system pending interconnection will be depreciated solar energy system in service when they have been interconnected and placed in service solar energy system under construction represents system that are under installation which will be depreciated solar energy system in

generally computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the respective asset follows machinery equipment vehicle and office furniture to year building and building improvement to year computer equipment and software to year leasehold improvement are depreciated on straight line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the term of the related lease upon the retirement or sale of our property plant and equipment the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operation maintenance and repair expenditure are expensed incurred while major improvement that increase the functionality output or expected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified useful life interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant capital asset construction capitalized interest on construction in progress is included within property plant and equipment net and is amortized over the life of the related asset long lived asset including acquired intangible asset we review our property plant and equipment solar energy system long term prepayment and intangible asset for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable we measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flow that the asset is expected to generate if the asset is not recoverable it carrying amount would be adjusted down to it fair value for the year ended december we have recognized no material impairment of our long lived asset for the year ended december and we have recognized certain impairment of our long lived asset refer to note restructuring and other for further detail intangible asset with definite life are amortized on straight line basis over their estimated useful life which range from one to thirty year goodwill we ass goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if event or change in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired by comparing it carrying value to the reporting unit fair value for the year ended december and we had not recognized any impairment of goodwill capitalization of software cost for cost incurred in development of internal use software we capitalize cost incurred during the application development stage to property plant and equipment net on the consolidated balance sheet cost related to preliminary project activity and post implementation activity are expensed incurred internal use software is amortized on straight line basis over it estimated useful life of three year we evaluate the useful life of these asset on an annual basis and we test for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance occur that could impact the recoverability of these asset foreign currency we determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiary and their operating division based on the primary currency in which they operate in case where the functional currency is not the dollar we recognize cumulative translation adjustment created by the different rate we apply to current period income or loss and the balance sheet for each subsidiary we apply the monthly average functional exchange rate to it monthly income or loss and the month end functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet foreign currency transaction gain and loss are result of the effect of exchange rate change on transaction denominated in currency other than the functional currency transaction gain and loss are recognized in other expense income net in the consolidated statement of operation for the year ended december and we recorded net foreign currency transaction loss of million gain of million and gain of million respectively warranty we provide manufacturer warranty on all new and used vehicle and warranty on the installation and component of the energy generation and storage system we sell for period typically between to year we accrue warranty reserve for the product sold by which includes our best estimate of the projected cost to repair or replace item under warranty and recall when identified these estimate are based on actual claim incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and cost of future claim these estimate are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sale and change to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material change to the warranty reserve in the future the warranty reserve doe not include projected warranty cost associated with our vehicle subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy system under lease contract or ppas the cost to repair these warranty claim are expensed incurred the portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next month is included within accrued liability and other while the remaining balance is included within other long term liability on the consolidated balance sheet warranty expense is recorded component of cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operation due to the magnitude of our automotive business accrued warranty balance wa primarily related to

existing warranty including expiration and foreign exchange impact additional warranty accrued from adoption of asc provision for warranty accrued warranty end of period solar renewable energy credit we account for solar renewable energy certificate srecs when they are purchased by or sold to third party for srecs generated by solar energy system owned by and minted by government agency we do not recognize any specifically identifiable cost there are no specific incremental cost incurred to generate the srecs we recognize revenue within the energy generation and storage segment from the sale of an srec when the srec is transferred to the buyer and the cost of the srec if any is then recorded to energy generation and storage cost of revenue nevada tax incentive in connection with the construction of gigafactory nevada we entered into agreement with the state of nevada and storey county in nevada that provide abatement for specified tax discount to the base tariff energy rate and transferable tax credit of up to million in consideration of capital investment and hiring target that were met at gigafactory nevada these incentive are available until june or june depending on the

we entered into year agreement with travis county in texas pursuant to which we would receive grant funding equal to of property tax paid by to travis county and separate year agreement with the del valle independent school district in texas pursuant to which portion of the taxable value of our property would be capped at specified amount in each case subject to our meeting certain minimum economic development metric through our construction and operation at gigafactory texas of december we had not yet received any grant funding related to property tax paid to travis county recent accounting pronouncement recently issued accounting pronouncement not yet adopted in december the fasb issued asu no simplifying the accounting for income tax part of it initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standard the amendment in the asu include removing exception to incremental intraperiod tax allocation of loss and gain from different financial statement component exception to the method of recognizing income tax on interim period loss and exception to deferred tax liability recognition related to foreign subsidiary investment in addition the asu requires that entity recognize franchise tax based on an incremental method and requires an entity to evaluate the accounting for step ups in the tax basis of goodwill inside or outside of business combination the amendment in the asu are effective for fiscal year beginning after december including interim period therein early adoption of the standard is permitted including adoption in interim or annual period for which financial statement have not yet been issued we have not early adopted this asu of december the asu is currently not expected to have material impact on our consolidated financial statement in march the fasb issued asu no facilitation of the effect of reference rate reform on financial reporting topic the asu provides optional expedient and exception for applying gaap to transaction affected by reference rate libor reform if certain criterion are met for limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for or recognizing the effect of reference rate reform on financial reporting the asu is effective of march through december we will evaluate transaction or contract modification occurring result of reference rate reform and determine whether to apply the optional guidance on an ongoing basis the asu is currently not expected to have material impact on our consolidated financial statement in august the fasb issued asu accounting for convertible instrument and contract in an entity own equity the asu simplifies the accounting for convertible instrument by removing certain separation model in asc debt debt with conversion and other option for convertible instrument the asu update the guidance on certain embedded conversion feature that are not required to be accounted for derivative under topic derivative and hedging or that do not result in substantial premium accounted for paid in capital such that those feature are no longer required to be separated from the host contract the convertible debt instrument will be accounted for single liability measured at amortized cost this will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible debt instrument to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when applying the guidance in topic interest further the asu made amendment to the eps guidance in topic for convertible instrument the most significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if converted method for diluted eps calculation and no longer allowing the net share settlement method the asu also made revision to topic which provides guidance on how an entity must determine whether contract qualifies for scope exception from derivative accounting the amendment to topic change the scope of contract that are recognized asset or liability the asu is effective for interim and annual period beginning after december with early adoption permitted for period beginning after december adoption of the asu can either be on modified retrospective or full retrospective basis we will adopt the asu on january on modified retrospective basis the adoption is expected to reduce additional paid in capital and convertible senior note mezzanine equity by approximately million and million respectively for the recombination of the equity conversion component of our convertible debt remaining outstanding which wa initially separated and recorded in equity remove the remaining debt discount recorded for this previous separation for approximately million and reduce property plant and equipment for previously capitalized interest by approximately million result the net effect of these adjustment will be recorded reduction in the balance of our opening accumulated deficit of january we currently expect the adoption of the asu will result in the reduction of non cash interest expense for the year ending december and until the affected note have been settled before the impact of reduction of our interest capitalization which is not expected to be material the reduction of depreciation expense through cost of good sold is not expected to be material for the year ending december these reduced expense will increase the income attributable to common stockholder for both basic and diluted earnings per share the required use of the if converted method is not expected to have significant impact on the calculation of common share equivalent included in the measure of our diluted earnings per share for our note note note and our subsidiary convertible senior note due in the amendment to the derivative accounting guidance are not expected to have material impact on our consolidated financial statement the adoption will have no impact on the consolidated statement of cash flow recently adopted accounting pronouncement in june the fasb issued asu no measurement of credit loss on financial instrument to require financial asset carried at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on historical experience current condition and forecast subsequently the fasb issued asu no codification improvement to topic to clarify that receivables arising from operating lease are within the scope of lease accounting standard further the fasb issued asu no asu no asu asu asu and asu to provide additional guidance on the credit loss standard adoption of the asus is on modified retrospective basis we adopted the asus on january the asus did not have material impact on our consolidated financial statement asu no applies to all financial asset including loan trade receivables and any other financial asset not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash the adoption of this asu did not have any impact except on mypower customer note receivable refer to mypower customer note receivable above for further detail in january the fasb issued asu no simplifying the test for goodwill impairment to simplify the test for goodwill impairment by removing step an entity will therefore perform the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of reporting unit with it carrying amount and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit an entity still ha the option to perform qualitative assessment to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary we adopted the asu prospectively on january the asu did not have material impact on our consolidated financial statement in august the fasb issued asu no customer accounting for implementation cost incurred in cloud computing arrangement that is service contract the asu aligns the requirement for capitalizing implementation cost incurred in hosting arrangement that is service contract with the requirement for capitalizing implementation cost incurred to develop or obtain internal use software and hosting arrangement that include an internal use software license we adopted the asu

compensation under the ceo performance award represents non cash expense and is recorded selling general and administrative operating expense in our consolidated statement of operation in each quarter since the grant of the ceo performance award we have recognized expense generally on pro rated basis for only the number of tranche up to the maximum of tranche that corresponds to the number of operational milestone that have been achieved or have been determined probable of being achieved in the future in accordance with the following principle on the grant date monte carlo simulation wa used to determine for each tranche fixed amount of expense for such tranche and ii the future time when the market capitalization milestone for such tranche wa expected to be achieved or it expected market capitalization milestone achievement time separately based on subjective assessment of our future financial performance each quarter we determine whether it is probable that we will achieve each operational milestone that ha not previously been achieved or deemed probable of achievement and if so the future time when we expect to achieve that operational milestone or it expected operational milestone achievement time when we first determine that an operational milestone ha become probable of being achieved we allocate the entire expense for the related tranche over the number of quarter between the grant date and the then applicable expected vesting time the expected vesting time at any given time is the later of the expected operational milestone achievement time if the related operational milestone ha not yet been achieved and ii the expected market capitalization milestone achievement time if the related market capitalization milestone ha not yet been achieved we immediately recognize catch up expense for all accumulated expense for the quarter from the grant date through the quarter in which the operational milestone wa first deemed probable of being achieved each quarter thereafter we recognize the prorated portion of the then remaining expense for the tranche based on the number of quarter between such quarter and the then applicable expected vesting time except that upon vesting of tranche all remaining expense for that tranche is immediately recognized result we have experienced and may experience in the future significant catch up expense in quarter when one or more operational milestone are first determined to be probable of being achieved additionally the expected market capitalization achievement time are generally later than the related expected operational milestone achievement time therefore if market capitalization milestone are achieved earlier than originally forecasted for example due to period of rapid stock price appreciation this ha resulted and may result in the future in higher catch up expense and the remaining expense being recognized over shorter period of time at higher per quarter rate during the three month ended june the first tranche of the ceo performance award vested upon certification by the board of director that the market capitalization milestone of billion and the operational milestone of

by the board of director that the market capitalization milestone of billion and billion and the operational milestone of annualized adjusted ebitda of billion and annualized adjusted ebitda of
