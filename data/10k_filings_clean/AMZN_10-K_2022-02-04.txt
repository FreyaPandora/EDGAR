of amount we invest in new technology product or service could result in the value of those investment being written or written in addition our sustainability initiative may be unsuccessful for variety of reason including if we are unable to realize the expected benefit of new technology or if we do not successfully plan or execute new strategy which could harm our business or damage our reputation our international operation expose to number of risksour international activity are significant to our revenue and profit and we plan to expand internationally in certain international market segment we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first to market advantage or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operation and store and promote our brand internationally our international operation may not become profitable on sustained basis in addition to risk described elsewhere in this section our international sale and operation are subject to number of risk including local economic and political condition government regulation such regulation of our product and service offering and of competition restrictive governmental action such trade protection measure including export duty and quota and custom duty and tariff nationalization and restriction on foreign ownership restriction on sale or distribution of certain product or service and uncertainty regarding liability for product service and content including uncertainty result of le internet friendly legal system local law lack of legal of contentsprecedent and varying rule regulation and practice regarding the physical and digital distribution of medium product and enforcement of intellectual property right business licensing or certification requirement such for import export web service and electronic device limitation on the repatriation and investment of fund and foreign currency exchange restriction limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure shorter payable and longer receivable cycle and the resultant negative impact on cash flow law and regulation regarding privacy data use data protection data security network security consumer protection payment advertising and restriction on pricing or discount lower level of use of the internet lower level of consumer spending and fewer opportunity for growth compared to the lower level of credit card usage and increased payment risk difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operation result of distance language and cultural difference different employee employer relationship and the existence of work council and labor union compliance with the foreign corrupt practice act and other applicable and foreign law prohibiting corrupt payment to government official and other third party law and policy of the and other jurisdiction affecting trade foreign investment loan and tax and geopolitical event including war and terrorism international physical commerce and omnichannel retail cloud service and other service grow competition intensify including through adoption of evolving business model local company may have substantial competitive advantage of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer well their more established local brand name the inability to hire train retain and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth the people republic of china prc and india regulate amazon and it affiliate business and operation in country through regulation and license requirement that may restrict foreign investment in and operation of the internet it infrastructure data center retail delivery and other sector ii internet content and iii the sale of medium and other product and service for example in order to meet local ownership regulatory licensing and cybersecurity requirement we provide certain technology service in china through contractual relationship with third party that hold prc license to provide service in india the government restricts the ownership or control of indian company by foreign entity involved in online multi brand retail trading activity for www amazon in we provide certain marketing tool and logistics service to third party seller to enable them to sell online and deliver to customer and we hold indirect minority interest in entity that are third party seller on the www amazon in marketplace although we believe these structure and activity comply with existing law they involve unique risk and the prc and india may from time to time consider and implement additional change in their regulatory licensing or other requirement that could impact these structure and activity are substantial uncertainty regarding the interpretation of prc and indian law and regulation and it is possible that these government will ultimately take view contrary to ours in addition our chinese and indian business and operation may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliate are unable to access sufficient funding or in china enforce contractual relationship we or our affiliate have in place violation of any existing or future prc indian or other law or regulation or change in the interpretation of those law and regulation could result in our business in those country being subject to fine and other financial penalty license revoked or being forced to restructure our operation or shut down entirely the variability in our retail business place increased strain on our operationsdemand for our product and service can fluctuate significantly for many reason including result of seasonality promotion product launch or unforeseeable event such in response to natural or human caused disaster including public health crisis or extreme weather including result of climate change or geopolitical event for example we expect disproportionate amount of our retail sale to occur during our fourth quarter our failure to stock or restock popular product in sufficient amount such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth we overstock product we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write offs and incur commitment cost which could materially reduce profitability we regularly experience increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrade split shipment and additional long zone shipment necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if many customer access our website within short period of time due to increased demand we may experience system interruption that make our website unavailable or prevent from efficiently fulfilling order which may reduce the volume of good we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our product and service in addition we may be unable of contentsto adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service center during these peak period and delivery and other fulfillment company and customer service co sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand risk described elsewhere in this item relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during period of high demand we generally have payment term with our retail vendor that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customer result of holiday sale of december of each year our cash cash equivalent and marketable security balance typically reach their highest level other than result of cash flow provided by or used in investing and financing activity this operating cycle result in corresponding increase in account payable of december our account payable balance generally decline during the first three month of the year resulting in corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalent and marketable security balance we are impacted by fraudulent or unlawful activity of sellersthe law relating to the liability of online service provider is currently unsettled in addition governmental agency have in the past and could in the future require change in the way this business is conducted under our seller program we maintain policy and process designed to prevent seller from collecting payment fraudulently or otherwise when buyer never receive the product they ordered or when the product received are materially different from the seller description and to prevent seller in our store or through other store from selling unlawful counterfeit pirated or stolen good selling good in an unlawful or unethical manner violating the proprietary right of others or otherwise violating our policy when these policy and process are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activity by our seller under our guarantee we reimburse buyer for payment to certain limit in these situation and our third party seller sale grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating result we face risk related to adequately protecting our intellectual property right and being accused of infringing intellectual property right of third partieswe regard our trademark service mark copyright patent trade dress trade secret proprietary technology and similar intellectual property critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreement with our employee customer and others to protect our proprietary right effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our product and service are made available we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain name in all country in which we do business furthermore regulation governing domain name may not protect our trademark and similar proprietary right we may be unable to prevent third party from acquiring domain name that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademark and other proprietary right we are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary right action taken by third party that license our proprietary right may materially diminish the value of our proprietary right or reputation the protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resource moreover the step we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our right or prevent third party from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary right we also can not be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property right we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claim and legal proceeding regarding alleged infringement by of the intellectual property right of third party such claim whether or not meritorious have in the past and may in the future result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resource injunction against or significant payment for damage including to satisfy indemnification obligation or to obtain license from third party allege that we have infringed their right such license may not be available on term acceptable to or all these risk have been amplified by the increase in third party whose sole or primary business is to assert such claim our digital content offering depend in part on effective digital right management technology to control access to digital content breach or malfunctioning of the digital right management technology that we use could subject to claim and content provider may be unwilling to include their content in our service we have foreign exchange riskthe result of operation of and certain of our intercompany balance associated with our international store and product and service offering are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuation due to these fluctuation operating result may differ materially from expectation and we may record significant gain or loss on the remeasurement of intercompany balance we have expanded our international operation our exposure to exchange rate fluctuation ha increased we also hold cash equivalent and or marketable security in foreign currency such british pound canadian dollar euro and of contentsjapanese yen when the dollar strengthens compared to these currency cash equivalent and marketable security balance when translated may be materially le than expected and vice versa operating risksour expansion place significant strain on our management operational financial and other resourceswe are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operation including increasing our product and service offering and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and service business the complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management personnel operation system technical performance financial resource and internal financial control and reporting function and our expansion increase these factor failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating result we experience significant fluctuation in our operating result and growth ratewe are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense level and investment plan on sale estimate significant portion of our expense and investment is fixed and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sale are le than expected our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rate may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the product and service offered by or our seller and our business is affected by general economic and business condition worldwide softening of demand whether caused by change in customer preference or weakening of the or global economy may result in decreased revenue or growth our sale and operating result will also fluctuate for many other reason including due to factor described elsewhere in this section and the following our ability to retain and increase sale to existing customer attract new customer and satisfy our customer demand our ability to retain and expand our network of seller our ability to offer product on favorable term manage inventory and fulfill order the introduction of competitive store website product service price decrease or improvement change in usage or adoption rate of the internet commerce electronic device and web service including outside the timing effectiveness and cost of expansion and upgrade of our system and infrastructure the success of our geographic service and product line expansion the extent to which we finance and the term of any such financing for our current operation and future growth the outcome of legal proceeding and claim which may include significant monetary damage or injunctive relief and could have material adverse impact on our operating result variation in the mix of product and service we sell variation in our level of merchandise and vendor return the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery continue to reduce price worldwide and provide additional benefit to our customer factor affecting our reputation or brand image including any actual or perceived inability to achieve our goal or commitment whether related to sustainability customer employee or other topic the extent to which we invest in technology and content fulfillment and other expense category increase in the price of fuel and gasoline energy product commodity like paper and packing supply and hardware product and technology infrastructure product constrained labor market which increase our payroll cost the extent to which operator of the network our customer and our store successfully charge fee to grant our customer unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online service our ability

centersfailures to adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data center successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity service interruption increased cost and impairment charge any of which could materially harm our business we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new business with different requirement our fulfillment and data center network become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our network effectively in addition failure to optimize inventory or staffing in our fulfillment network increase our net shipping cost by requiring long zone or partial shipment we and our co sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service center for example productivity across our fulfillment network currently is being affected by global supply chain constraint and constrained labor market which increase payroll cost and make it difficult to hire train and deploy sufficient number of people to operate our fulfillment network efficiently we would like we are also subject to labor union effort to organize group of our employee from time to time and if successful those organizational effort may decrease our operational flexibility which could adversely affect our fulfillment network operating efficiency under some of our commercial agreement we maintain the inventory of other company thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other business on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment service to accurately forecast product demand may result in being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected cost and other harm to our business and reputation we rely on limited number of shipping company to deliver inventory to and completed order to our customer an inability to negotiate acceptable term with these company or performance problem staffing limitation or other difficulty experienced by these company or by our own transportation system including result of labor market constraint and related cost could negatively impact our operating result and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed order to customer also may be negatively affected by natural or human caused disaster including public health crisis or extreme weather including result of climate change geopolitical event and security issue labor or trade dispute and similar event we could be harmed by data loss or other security breachesbecause we collect process store and transmit large amount of data including confidential sensitive proprietary and business and

we use third party technology and system for variety of reason including without limitation encryption and authentication technology employee email content delivery to customer back office support and other function some of our system have experienced past security breach and although they not have material adverse effect on our operating result there can be no assurance that future incident will not have material adverse effect on our operation or financial result although we have developed system and process that are designed to protect customer data and prevent such incident including system and process designed to reduce the impact of security breach at third party vendor or customer such measure can not provide absolute security and may fail to operate intended or be circumvented we face risk related to system interruption and lack of redundancywe experience occasional system interruption and delay that make our website and service unavailable or slow to respond and prevent from efficiently accepting or fulfilling order or providing service to customer and third party which may reduce our net sale and the attractiveness of our product and service step we take to add

or the impact of other indirect factor that may be attributable to the pandemic and the extent to which these or other currently unanticipated consequence of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our result of operation however we expect our net sale growth rate to decelerate in compared to the increase we experienced in in addition these direct and indirect factor can make it difficult to isolate and quantify the portion of our cost that are direct result of the pandemic and cost arising from factor that may have been influenced by the pandemic including increased wage rate and incentive increased carrier rate and fulfillment network inefficiency resulting from constrained labor market and global supply chain constraint we expect these factor and their effect on our

related to sortation and delivery center and where we are the transportation service provider and digital medium content cost where we record revenue gross including video and music the increase in cost of sale in absolute dollar in compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased product and shipping cost resulting from increased sale cost from expanding our fulfillment network well

cost were billion and billion in and we expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customer accept and use our shipping offer at an increasing rate we use more expensive shipping method including faster delivery and we offer additional service we seek to mitigate cost of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sale volume optimizing our fulfillment network negotiating better term with our supplier and achieving better operating efficiency we believe that offering low price to our customer is fundamental to our future success and one way we offer lower

our customer self service feature additionally sale by our seller have higher payment processing and related transaction cost percentage of net sale compared to our retail sale because payment processing cost are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transaction the increase in fulfillment cost in absolute dollar in compared to the prior year is primarily due to variable cost

offering due to geographic expansion and the cross functionality of our system and operation we expect spending in technology and content to increase over time we continue to add employee and technology infrastructure these cost are allocated to segment based on usage the increase in technology and content cost in absolute dollar in compared to the prior year is primarily due to an increase in spending on technology infrastructure and increased payroll and related cost associated with technical team responsible for expanding our existing product and service and initiative to introduce new product and service offering we expect technology and content cost to grow at slower rate in due to increase in the estimated useful life of our server and networking equipment which

increased or decreased competition for these traffic source or to the extent our mix of these channel shift we would expect to see corresponding change in our marketing cost the increase in marketing
