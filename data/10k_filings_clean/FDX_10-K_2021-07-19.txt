addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise certain airport operator have local noise regulation which limit aircraft operation by type of aircraft and time of day these regulation have had restrictive effect on fedex express aircraft operation in some of the locality where they apply but do not have material effect in any of fedex express significant market congress passage of the airport noise and capacity act of established national noise policy which enabled fedex express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraint fedex express international operation are also subject to noise regulation in certain of the country in which it operates concern over climate change including the impact of global warming ha led to significant and international legislative and regulatory effort to limit ghg emission including our aircraft and vehicle engine emission increasingly state and local government are also considering ghg regulatory requirement compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various country and region are following different approach to the regulation of climate change for example the eu ha established the emission trading system ets to regulate ghg emission in the eu and adopted directive in requiring each eu member state to extend the ets to aviation operation effort by the eu in to regulate flight arriving from or departing for airport outside of the eu were postponed the eu extended it stay on the extra territorial application of the eu ets applied to international flight to and from the european economic area eea through the end of calendar contingent on successful implementation of the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation corsia in the international civil aviation organization icao passed resolution adopting corsia which is global market based measure for purchasing credit to offset carbon dioxide emission and intended to aid in meeting the icao goal of carbon neutral growth starting in calendar by complementing industry effort in infrastructure upgrade technology operation and sustainable aviation fuel in june the icao adopted standard pertaining to country by country implementation including the collection and reporting of information on international aviation emission beginning in calendar in furtherance of these effort in march the faa issued notice of corsia program permitting carrier to submit emission data on voluntary basis data reported will be used to set the initial emission baseline and beginning in calendar carrier subject to the requirement of corsia will be responsible for purchasing and retiring carbon credit to offset emission in excess of the initial baseline in response to the creation of the corsia program in december the eu adopted proposal that indefinitely excludes from the ets flight operating fully or partly outside the eu and gradually reduces the number of aviation allowance from calendar the eu ha indicated that it will ass corsia implementation and determine the future status of the ets applied to international aviation to and from the eea we expect compliance with corsia to increase fedex operating expense beginning in calendar the amount of such increase will ultimately depend on number of factor including the number of our flight subject to corsia the fuel efficiency of our fleet the average growth of the aviation sector our ability to utilize sustainable aviation fuel in the future and the price of icao eligible emission unit or offset required to be purchased by fedex additionally in calendar the epa issued finding that aircraft engine ghg emission cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare in march icao adopted new carbon dioxide emission standard that would apply not only to new aircraft type of calendar but also to new delivery of current in production aircraft type from calendar additionally cutoff date of calendar for production of aircraft that do not comply with proposed standard wa adopted these standard are considered to be especially stringent for larger aircraft weighing over ton in december the epa adopted it own aircraft and aircraft engine ghg emission standard which are aligned with the icao emission standard in the past the congress ha also considered bill that would regulate ghg emission and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future in the reentered the paris climate accord an agreement among country to reduce ghg emission the effect of the reentry on future policy regarding ghg emission and on other ghg regulation is uncertain additionally the extent to which other country implement that agreement could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business we are also subject to federal state and local environmental law and regulation relating to among other thing the shipment of dangerous good and contingency planning for spill of petroleum product additionally we are subject to numerous regulation dealing with underground fuel storage tank hazardous waste handling vehicle and equipment emission and noise and the discharge of effluent from our property and equipment we have environmental management program designed to ensure compliance with these regulation export control in recent year the government ha increased the number of company and person subject to export control regulation such regulation can restrict the type of item that fedex customer are permitted to ship to certain entity and in some instance may prohibit fedex from serving certain entity altogether violation of these regulation can result in significant monetary and other penalty for example the export control reform act of the ecra and it implementing regulation the export administration regulation the ear hold carrier such fedex strictly liable for shipment that may violate the ear without requiring evidence that the carrier had knowledge of any violation violation of the ecra can result in criminal penalty of up to million and civil penalty of or twice the value of the transaction per individual violation fedex is investing in improvement and update to it export control compliance program however the heightened focus on export control by the government increase fedex exposure to potential regulatory penalty and could result in higher compliance cost in june fedex filed suit in district court in the district of columbia seeking to enjoin the department of commerce the doc from enforcing prohibition contained in the ear against fedex fedex belief that the ear violate common carrier right to due process under the fifth amendment of the constitution they unreasonably hold common carrier strictly liable for shipment that may violate the ear without requiring evidence that the carrier had knowledge of any violation in september the court granted the doc motion to dismiss the lawsuit in november we appealed this decision custom our activity including custom brokerage and freight forwarding are subject to regulation by custom and border protection and the tsa within the department of homeland security custom brokerage and security issue the federal maritime commission ocean freight forwarding and the dot air freight forwarding our offshore operation are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authority of foreign jurisdiction labor all employee at fedex express are covered by the railway labor act of amended the rla while labor relation within the at our other company are governed by the national labor relation act of amended the nlra under the rla group that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide class of employee the rla also requires mandatory government led mediation of contract dispute supervised by the national mediation board before union can strike or an employer can replace employee or impose contract term this part of the rla help minimize the risk of strike that would shut large portion of the economy under the nlra employee can unionize in small localized group and government led mediation is not required step in the negotiation process the rla wa originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiation transportation system evolved the law expanded to cover airline which are the dominant national transportation system of today an air express carrier with an integrated air ground network fedex express and it employee have been covered by the rla since the founding of the company in the purpose of the rla is to offer employee process by which to unionize if they choose and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppage and delay specifically the rla ensures that an entire transportation system such at fedex express can not be shut down by the action of local segment of the network the congress ha in the past considered adopting change in labor law that would make it easier for union to organize unit of our employee for example is always possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employee from the jurisdiction of the rla thereby exposing the fedex express network to sporadic labor dispute and the risk that small group of employee could disrupt the entire air ground network in addition federal and state governmental agency such the national mediation board and the nlrb have and may continue to take action that could make it easier for our employee to organize under the rla or nlra for description of these and other potential labor law change see item risk factor of this annual report data protection recently there ha been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the at both the state and federal level and abroad for example the eu general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective in greatly increase the jurisdictional reach of eu law and add broad array of requirement related to personal data including individual notice and opt preference and the public disclosure of significant data breach additionally violation of the gdpr can result in fine of much of company annual revenue other government have enacted or are enacting similar data protection law including data localization law that require data to stay within their border for more information regarding data protection regulation see item risk factor of this annual report item risk factor in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report you should carefully consider the following factor which could materially affect our business result of operation financial condition and the price of our common stock additional risk not currently known to or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business result of operation financial condition and the price of our common stock macroeconomic and market risk we are directly affected by the state of the global economy and anti trade measure while macroeconomic risk apply to most company we are particularly vulnerable the transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trend in economic activity our primary business is to transport good so our business level are directly tied to the purchase and production of good key macroeconomic measurement influenced by among other thing inflation and deflation supply chain disruption interest rate and currency exchange rate labor cost fuel and energy price buying pattern debt level credit availability and disposable income when individual and company purchase and produce fewer good we transport fewer good and company move manufacturing closer to consumer market and expand the number of distribution center we transport good shorter distance certain retailer are making investment to house good in closer proximity to customer in connection with the recent growth in commerce demand and we expect this trend to continue in addition we have relatively high fixed cost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume level moreover we continue to grow our international business we are increasingly affected by the health of the global economy the rate of growth of global trade world trade policy international tax government to government relation and the typically more volatile economy of emerging market for instance anti trade and protectionist measure adopted by the or other country in which we do business such trade control tariff quota embargo sanction or retaliation by another country against such measure could result in economic uncertainty and instability resulting in fewer good being transported globally the uncertainty regarding the status of the united kingdom exit from the eu brexit ha negatively impacted the united kingdom and the eu economy this negative impact will likely continue the united kingdom and eu complete post brexit trade deal which is still in the process of being implemented any additional impact of brexit will depend on application of the term of the trade deal further discussion between the party on implementation of the trade deal could trigger significant market and economic disruption and the demand for our service could be depressed following brexit the movement of good between the united kingdom and the remaining member state of the eu ha become subject to additional inspection and documentation check which may create delay at port of entry and departure and potentially impact our ability to effectively provide our service additionally depending on the application of the term of the trade deal we may face new regulation regarding trade aviation tax security and employee among others in the united kingdom compliance with such regulation could be costly negatively impacting our business result of operation and financial condition the post brexit trade deal could also adversely affect european and worldwide economic and market condition and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange market including volatility in the value of the euro and the british pound we expect continued uncertainty in the global economy during additionally we incurred higher cost due to labor market challenge in and we expect such condition to continue to be present in for more information see our failure to retain or attract employee talent or maintain our company culture well increase in labor and purchased transportation cost could adversely impact our business and result of operation below and item management discussion and analysis of result of operation and financial condition of this annual report additional change in international trade policy and relation could significantly reduce the volume of good transported globally and adversely affect our business and result of operation the government ha made and maintained significant change in trade policy and ha taken certain action that have negatively impacted trade including imposing tariff on certain good imported into the several government including the eu china and india have imposed tariff on certain good imported from the these action contributed to weakness in the global economy that adversely affected our result of operation in recent year any further change in or international trade policy could trigger additional retaliatory action by affected country resulting in trade war and further increased cost for good transported globally which may reduce customer demand for these product if the party to pay those tariff increase their price or in trading partner limiting their trade with country that impose anti trade measure political uncertainty surrounding international trade and other dispute could also have negative effect on business and consumer confidence and spending such condition could have an adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition well on the price of our common stock additionally the government ha taken action to limit the ability of domestic company to engage in commerce with certain foreign entity under certain circumstance and foreign government may investigate our compliance with these restriction furthermore given the nature of our business and our global recognizability foreign government may target fedex by limiting the ability of foreign entity to do business with in certain instance imposing monetary or other penalty or taking other retaliatory action which could have an adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition well on the price of our common stock our transportation business are impacted by the price and availability of jet and vehicle fuel we must purchase large quantity of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicle and the price and availability of fuel is beyond our control and can be highly volatile in addition our purchased transportation expense may be impacted by fuel cost to date we have been mostly successful in mitigating over time the expense impact of higher fuel cost through our indexed fuel surcharge the amount of the surcharge is closely linked to the market price for fuel if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharge because of competitive pricing pressure or some other reason fuel cost could adversely impact our operating result of may we had no derivative financial instrument to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuation even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharge high fuel surcharge could move our customer away from our higher yielding express service to our lower yielding deferred or ground service or even reduce customer demand for our service altogether in addition disruption in the supply of fuel could have negative impact on our ability to operate our transportation network weather related event natural disaster political disruption or war involving oil producing country economic sanction imposed against oil producing country or specific industry participant change in governmental policy concerning fuel production transportation tax or marketing change in refining capacity environmental concern cyberattacks and other unpredictable event may impact fuel supply and could result in shortage and price increase in the future operating risk significant data breach or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could disrupt our operation and result in the loss of critical confidential information adversely impacting our reputation business or result of operation our ability to attract and retain customer to efficiently operate our business and to compete effectively depends in part upon the sophistication security and reliability of our technology network including our ability to provide feature of service that are important to our customer to protect our confidential business information and the information provided by our customer and to maintain customer confidence in our ability to protect our system and to provide service consistent with their expectation for example we rely on information technology to receive package level information in advance of physical receipt of package to track item that move through our delivery system to efficiently plan delivery to execute billing process and to track and report financial and operational data we are subject to risk imposed by data breach and operational disruption including through cyberattack or cyber intrusion including by computer hacker foreign government cyber terrorist cyber criminal and malicious employee or other insider of fedex or third party service provider data breach of company and government have increased in recent year the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attack and intrusion from around the world have increased and we our customer and third party increasingly store and transmit data by mean of connected information technology system additionally risk such code anomaly act of god transitional challenge in migrating operating company functionality to our fedex enterprise automation platform data leakage cyber fraud and human error pose direct threat to our product service system and data and could result in unauthorized or block legitimate access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operation customer employee and supplier including personal information the technology infrastructure of acquired business well their practice related to the use and maintenance of data could also present issue that we were not able to identify prior to the acquisition see failure to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to change in market dynamic and customer preference will cause our future financial result to suffer below for additional information on risk related to our recent acquisition of shoprunner and launch of fedex dataworks we also depend on and interact with the technology and system of third party including our customer and third party service provider such cloud service provider and delivery service such third party may host process or have access to information we maintain about our company customer employee and vendor or operate system that are critical to our business operation and service like these third party are subject to risk imposed by data breach cyberattacks and other event or action that could damage disrupt or close down their network or system we have security process protocol and standard in place including contractual provision requiring such security measure that are applicable to such third party and are designed to protect information that is held by them or to which they have access result of their engagement with nevertheless cyberattack could defeat one or more of such third party security measure allowing an attacker to obtain information about our company customer employee and vendor or disrupt our operation these third party may also experience operational disruption or human error that could result in unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operation customer employee and supplier including personal information disruption to our complex global technology infrastructure including those impacting our computer system and website could result in the loss of confidential business or customer information require substantial repair or replacement resulting in significant cost and lead to the temporary or permanent transfer by customer of some or all of their business to our competitor the foregoing could harm our reputation and adversely impact our operation customer service and result of operation additionally security breach could require to devote significant management resource to address the problem created these type of adverse impact could also occur in the event the confidentiality integrity or availability of company and customer information wa compromised due to data loss by fedex or trusted third party we or the third party with which we share information may not discover any security breach and loss of information for significant period of time after the security breach occurs we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiative information technology risk management business continuity and disaster recovery plan including investment to retire and replace end of life system the development and maintenance of these measure is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating technology change and effort to overcome security measure become increasingly more frequent intense and sophisticated despite our effort we are not fully insulated from data breach technology disruption data loss and cyber fraud which could adversely impact our competitiveness and result of operation for instance in tnt express worldwide operation were significantly affected due to the infiltration of an information technology virus known notpetya in fedex wa one of many company attacked by the rapidly spreading ransomware described wannacry that exploited vulnerability in third party software program and infected computer using that program encrypting file and holding them for ransom during we discovered an unsecured server hosted by one of our third party cloud service provider which exposed some archived account information related to service discontinued after our acquisition of bongo international llc the server ha been secured and we have found no indication that any information ha been misappropriated in connection with the incident additionally we have experienced continual attempt by cyber criminal some of which were successful to gain access to customer account for the purpose of fraudulently diverting and misappropriating item being transported in our network none of the wannacry ransomware attack unsecured server or fraudulent cyber activity caused material disruption to our system or resulted in any material cost to fedex while we have significant security process and initiative in place we may be unable to detect or prevent breach or disruption in the future additionally while we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspect of cyber risk in place such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all loss or all type of claim that may arise see our business is subject to complex and evolving and foreign law and regulation regarding data protection below for additional information on risk related to legal and regulatory development with respect to data protection the continuing impact of the covid pandemic on our business result of operation and financial condition is highly unpredictable the covid pandemic ha had varying impact on the demand for our service our business operation and the global economy and supply chain there is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which covid will continue to spread in certain region of the world and the extent and duration of measure to try to contain the virus such travel ban and restriction quarantine shelter in place order business and government shutdown and other restriction this uncertainty is expected to continue to impact our business in we have experienced unprecedented demand for our residential delivery service rivaling our peak holiday season traffic we have incurred increased cost associated with this demand and lower composite yield than our typical service mix in addition demand for our commercial service offering increased throughout covid restriction moderated globally while air freight capacity remained constrained our business is labor and capital intensive in nature which ha required to incur higher cost to operate our network during the pandemic if we are unable to remain agile and continue to flex our network to align with shipping volume customer need disrupted global supply chain and other network inefficiency market demand and operating condition or are unable to continuously respond to evolving governmental policy for the duration of prolonged period of economic recovery our business operation could be negatively impacted which could have further adverse effect on our result of operation we have also incurred increased operating expense related to personal protective equipment and medical safety supply well additional security and cleaning service in order to protect our team member and customer due to the size scope and geographically dispersed nature of our operation the expense we incur to protect the health and safety of certain of our employee may be higher than similar expense incurred by company in other industry additionally significant number of our employee well customer and others with we do business continue to work remotely in response to the covid pandemic our business operation may be disrupted and we may experience increased risk of adverse effect on our business if significant portion of our workforce or certain business operation are negatively impacted result of remote work arrangement including due to cyber risk or other disruption to our technology infrastructure the continuing impact of the covid pandemic including the extent of it effect on our business result of operation and financial condition well the global economy will be dictated by future development that remain uncertain and can not be predicted such it duration and spread the success of effort to contain it and treat it impact the possibility of additional subsequent widespread outbreak and variant strain and the impact of action taken in response resulting effect on the economic condition in the global market in which we operate the future rate of commerce growth and the timeline for recovery of passenger airline cargo capacity certain financial and operating metric that we reported for may not be indicative of result for future period the impact of the covid pandemic subsides to the extent the covid pandemic adversely affect our business and financial result it may also have the effect of heightening many other risk described in this section any of which could materially and adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition such risk include but are not limited to additional change in the state of the global economy and international trade policy and relation our ability to implement our business strategy and effectively respond to change in market dynamic and customer preference our strong reputation and the value of the fedex brand our ability to meet our labor and purchased transportation need while controlling related cost our ability to execute and effectively operate integrate leverage and grow acquired business change in the business and financial soundness of the usps our ability to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operation by calendar and the impact of litigation or claim from customer team member supplier regulator or other third party relating to the covid pandemic or our action in response to the pandemic for more information about the covid pandemic and it effect on our business result of operation and financial condition see item management discussion and analysis of result of operation and financial condition result of operation and outlook consolidated result impact of the covid pandemic of this annual report we are self insured for certain cost associated with our operation and insurance and claim expense could have material adverse effect on we are self insured up to certain limit that vary by type of risk for cost associated with worker compensation claim vehicle accident property and cargo loss general business liability and benefit paid under employee healthcare and disability program our reserve are established for estimate of loss on all incurred claim including incurred but not reported claim our self insurance accrual are primarily based on estimated cost determined by actuarial method estimated cost include consideration of variety of factor and related assumption such the severity of claim frequency and volume of claim healthcare inflation seasonality and plan design which may be subject to high degree of variability however the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive material increase in the magnitude of claim change to healthcare cost accident frequency and severity insurance retention level judgment and settlement amount associated legal expense and other factor could result in unfavorable difference between actual self insurance cost and our reserve estimate result our insurance and claim cost could increase materially which could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition during higher self insurance accrual at fedex ground negatively impacted our result of operation see item management discussion and analysis of result of operation and financial condition of this annual report for more information supplement to our self insurance program we maintain coverage with excess insurance carrier for potential loss that exceed the amount we self insure periodically we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance level based on risk tolerance risk volatility and premium expense although we believe our aggregate insurance limit should be sufficient to cover our historic claim amount the commercial trucking industry ha experienced wave of blockbuster or so called nuclear verdict including some instance in which jury have awarded hundred of million of dollar to those injured in accident and their family given this recent trend it is possible that one or more claim could exceed our aggregate coverage limit if any claim were to exceed our aggregate insurance coverage we would bear the excess in addition to our other self insured amount given the current claim environment the amount of coverage available from excess insurance carrier is decreasing and the premium for this excess coverage are increasing significantly accordingly our excess insurance and claim expense may increase or we could increase our self insured retention policy are renewed or replaced our result of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected if our cost or loss significantly exceed our aggregate coverage limit we are unable to obtain excess insurance coverage in amount we deem sufficient our insurance carrier fail to pay on our insurance claim or we experience claim for which coverage is not provided the transportation infrastructure continues to be target of terrorist activity because transportation asset continue to be target of terrorist activity government around the world are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirement that will increase operating cost and potentially slow service for business including those in the transportation industry these security requirement are not static but change periodically the result of regulatory and legislative requirement imposing additional security cost and creating level of uncertainty for our operation for example the tsa requires fedex express to comply with full all cargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains evolving and strict security requirement additionally the icao standard that previously allowed member state to permit carrier and other entity to determine without government oversight which shipper and shipment are secure for purpose of putting those shipment on all cargo aircraft wa modified effective july result we are now required to undertake additional security measure for international outbound shipment it is reasonably possible that these rule or other future security requirement could impose material cost on or slow our service to our customer the impact on our operation of avoiding area of the world including airspace in which there are geopolitical conflict and the targeting of aircraft by party to those conflict can also be significant moreover terrorist attack directed at fedex or other aspect of the transportation infrastructure could disrupt our operation and adversely impact demand for our service strategic risk failure to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to change in market dynamic and customer preference will cause our future financial result to suffer we are making significant investment and other decision in connection with our long term business strategy such investment in aircraft fleet modernization strategic investment to increase capacity and improve productivity and safety and the fedex express indianapolis and memphis hub modernization and expansion program additionally we are executing initiative to use data to transform the digital and physical experience of our customer and team member well to transform and optimize the fedex express international business particularly in europe see item business and item management discussion and analysis of result of operation and financial condition of this annual report for additional information such initiative and enhancement may require to make significant capital expenditure we have also incurred and may continue to incur increased operating expense in connection with certain change to our business strategy we may not be able to derive the expected value from our strategic investment and other decision for example in we announced proposal to resize our european workforce fedex express nears the completion of the network integration of tnt express including through consultation with work council representative from across the region the actual amount and timing of cost saving resulting from the workforce reduction plan are dependent on local country consultation process and regulation and negotiated social plan may differ from our current expectation and estimate if we are not able to successfully implement this plan our future financial result may suffer change in our business strategy may also expose to new and heightened risk for example shoprunner which we acquired in december collect and store certain personal data of it merchant and their buyer it partner consumer with whom it ha direct relationship and user of it application additionally it us third party service provider and subprocessors to help deliver service to merchant and their buyer these service provider and subprocessors may store or access personal data including payment information and or other confidential information the foregoing factor increase the risk of data incident and the amount of potential exposure in the event of data breach developing privacy legislation within the may also create limitation or added requirement on the use of personal data within and among fedex dataworks shoprunner and the other fedex operating company further in developing our business strategy we make certain assumption including but not limited to those related to customer demand and the mix of service to be purchased by our customer the future rate of commerce growth competition and the global economy and actual market economic and other condition may be different from our assumption technology customer behavior and market condition continue to evolve it is important that we maintain the relevance of our brand and service offering to our customer if we are not able to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to change in market dynamic and customer preference our future financial result will suffer for additional discussion see item business of this annual report under the caption strategy our business depend on our strong reputation and the value of the fedex brand the fedex brand name symbolizes high quality service reliability and speed fedex is one of the most widely recognized trusted and respected brand in the world and the fedex brand is one of our most important and valuable asset in addition we have strong reputation among customer and the general public for high standard of social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance and ethic the fedex brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sale and marketing tool and we devote significant resource to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activity by our team member or others with whom we do business such customer service mishap accident catastrophe or incident involving aircraft vehicle or facility operated by low service or safety level data breach or technology infrastructure disruption noncompliance with law the shipment of certain item pursuant to our obligation common carrier operating under federal law or our advertising campaign sponsorship arrangement or marketing program could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand with the increase in the use of social medium outlet such facebook youtube instagram twitter and tiktok adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly without context making it increasingly difficult for to effectively respond further our actual or perceived position or lack of position on social environmental political public policy or other sensitive issue and any perceived lack of transparency about those matter could harm our reputation with certain group damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our service and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and result of operation well require additional resource to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand change in the business or financial soundness of the usps could have an adverse effect on our result of operation and financial condition the usps is the largest customer of fedex express which provides domestic air transportation service for the usps first class mail priority mail express and priority mail and transportation and delivery for the usps international delivery service the covid pandemic ha negatively impacted the usps additionally the usps continues to experience budgetary uncertainty well increased political debate regarding potential privatization or restructuring of it operation the usps is currently implementing strategic change to it operation to reduce it reliance on the air network of fedex express and other transportation provider these or additional difficulty or change in the usps business including it ability to access capital any structural change to it operation network volume level service offering service commitment or pricing could negatively impact our revenue result of operation and financial condition further decision by the usps to terminate early or not renew it contract with fedex express for domestic service which expires in september would negatively impact our profitability our business are capital intensive and we must make capital decision based upon projected volume level we make significant investment in aircraft package handling facility vehicle technology sort equipment and other asset to support our transportation and business network we also make significant investment to rebrand integrate and grow the company that we acquire the amount and timing of capital investment depend on various factor including our anticipated volume growth we must make commitment to purchase or modify aircraft year before the aircraft are actually needed we must predict volume level and fleet requirement and make commitment for aircraft based on those projection missing our projection could result in much or too little capacity relative to our shipping volume overcapacity could lead to below market asset disposition or write down well negatively impact operating margin and undercapacity could negatively impact service level we face intense competition the transportation and business service market are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service especially in period of little or no macroeconomic growth some of our competitor have more financial resource and competitive advantage than we do appear willing to operate at little or no margin to gain market share or they are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign government which enables them to raise capital more easily we also compete with regional transportation provider that operate smaller and le capital intensive transportation network and startup company that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market need in addition some high volume package shipper are developing and implementing in house delivery capability and utilizing independent contractor for delivery which could in turn reduce our revenue and market share for example amazon com is investing significant capital to establish network of hub aircraft and vehicle we believe we compete effectively with these company for example by providing more reliable service at compensatory price however the existence of an irrational pricing environment could limit our ability not only to maintain or increase our price including our fuel surcharge in response to rising fuel cost but also to maintain or grow our revenue and market share while we believe we compete effectively through our current and planned service offering if our current competitor or potential future competitor offer broader range of service more effectively bundle their service or offer service at lower price it could impede our ability to maintain or grow our market share continued transportation industry consolidation may further increase competition moreover if high volume package shipper further develop or expand internal capability for the service we provide it may reduce our revenue and could negatively impact our financial condition and result of operation these impact could be exacerbated if high volume package shipper attempt to offer such capability to third party news regarding such development or expansion could also negatively impact the price of our common stock additionally advancement in technology such advanced safety system automated package sorting handling and delivery autonomous delivery vehicle platooning alternative fuel vehicle and digitization of freight service may necessitate that we increase investment in order to remain competitive and our customer may not be willing to accept higher rate to cover the cost of these investment our inability to execute and effectively operate integrate leverage and grow acquired business and realize the anticipated benefit of acquisition joint venture or strategic alliance could materially adversely affect our strategy for long term growth productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to make prudent strategic acquisition form joint venture or strategic alliance and realize the expected benefit from these transaction we have acquired business in europe latin america africa the asia and australia over the past several year including tnt express expected tnt express integration cost have increased significantly since the acquisition wa completed in and part of the integration have taken longer than initially expected in order to fully leverage the capability that tnt express add to our portfolio we must complete the final phase of fedex express and tnt express international air network interoperability acquisition and other strategic transaction involve special accounting regulatory compliance information technology human resource cultural and other risk additionally we may be required to make significant capital expenditure and or incur certain operating expense following the completion of certain transaction which may be higher than initially expected for example existing and future customer data in the system and business of fedex and shoprunner which we acquired in december may not be immediately interoperable or may not be interoperable without significant added expense while we expect our past and future acquisition and strategic transaction to enhance our value proposition to customer and improve our business and long term profitability there can be no assurance that we will realize our expectation within the time frame we have established if at all or that we can continue to support the value we allocate to acquired business including their goodwill or other intangible asset in we incurred goodwill impairment charge of million related to fedex office and fedex supply chain eliminating all of the goodwill attributable to these reporting unit for additional information see item management discussion and analysis of result of operation and financial condition result of operation and outlook consolidated result goodwill and other asset impairment charge of this annual report our autonomous delivery strategy is dependent upon our ability to successfully mitigate unique technological operational and regulatory risk discussed further in item business under fedex service segment customer driven technology autonomous delivery technology we are exploring the use of autonomous delivery technology within our operation autonomous delivery is new and evolving market which make it difficult to predict it acceptance growth the magnitude and timing of necessary investment and other trend this aspect of our business strategy is subject to variety of risk inherent with the development of new technology including the ability to continue to develop autonomous delivery software and hardware access to sufficient capital our ability to develop and maintain necessary partnership risk related to the manufacture of autonomous device and significant competition from other company some of which may have more resource and capital to devote to autonomous delivery technology than we do in addition we face risk related to the commercial deployment of autonomous delivery device on our targeted timeline or at all including consumer acceptance achievement of adequate safety and other performance standard and compliance with uncertain evolving and potentially conflicting federal and state regulation to the extent accident cybersecurity breach or other adverse event associated with our autonomous delivery device occur we could be subject to liability government scrutiny further regulation and reputational damage any of the foregoing could adversely impact our result of operation financial condition and growth prospect human resource management risk our failure to retain or attract employee talent or maintain our company culture well increase in labor and purchased transportation cost could adversely impact our business and result of operation our success depends upon the effort and ability of our high quality employee many of whom are longstanding fedex team member difficulty in motivating rewarding retaining and recruiting employee talent including successor to member of senior management or the unexpected loss of such individual resulting in the depletion of our institutional knowledge base could have an adverse impact on our business result of operation reputation and the price of our common stock certain position at fedex have historically experienced high turnover rate which can lead to increased recruiting training and retention cost additionally our company culture is important to providing high quality customer service and having productive workforce and could be adversely affected by our growing operation and other factor if we fail to maintain the strength of our company culture our competitive ability and our business may be harmed our business is labor intensive in nature and our ability to meet our labor and purchased transportation need while controlling related cost is generally subject to numerous external factor including the availability of sufficient number of qualified person in the market where we and contracted service provider operate inflation unemployment level within these market prevailing wage rate behavioral change health and other insurance cost safety level of our operation adoption of new or revised employment and labor law and regulation including increased minimum wage requirement or government program and our reputation within the labor market we incurred higher cost due to labor market challenge in and we expect such condition to continue to be present in additionally we are incurring increased wage rate and cost for additional personnel in place to support our operation and meet regulatory requirement in response to the covid pandemic see item management discussion and analysis of result of operation and financial condition of this annual report for more information our inability to effectively meet our labor and purchased transportation need can hinder our ability to execute our business strategy negatively impact service level and adversely affect our business and result of operation labor organization attempt to organize group of our employee from time to time and potential change in labor law could make it easier for them to do so if we are unable to continue to maintain good relationship with our employee and avoid having labor organization organize group of our employee our operating cost could significantly increase and our operational flexibility could be significantly reduced despite continual organizing attempt by labor union other than the pilot at fedex express and driver at one fedex freight inc facility our employee have thus far chosen not to unionize we acquired fedex supply chain in which already had small number of employee who are member of union additionally certain of fedex express non employee are unionized our collective bargaining agreement with the alpa which represents the pilot of fedex express is scheduled to become amendable in november bargaining for successor agreement began in may while collective bargaining agreement under the rla which cover the pilot at fedex express do not expire we may be unable to maintain certain favorable term included in the current collective bargaining agreement following negotiation with the alpa our inability to successfully reach new collective bargaining agreement with the alpa and other union representing fedex employee could adversely affect our business and result of operation the congress ha in the past considered adopting change in labor law however that would make it easier for union to organize unit of our employee for example there is always possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employee from the jurisdiction of the rla for additional discussion of the rla see item business of this annual report under the caption regulation such legislation could expose our customer to the type of service disruption that the rla wa designed to prevent local work stoppage in key area that interrupt the timely flow of shipment of time sensitive high value good throughout our global network such disruption could threaten our ability to provide competitively priced shipping option and ready access to global market there is also the possibility that congress could pas other labor legislation that could adversely affect our company such fedex ground and fedex freight whose employee are governed by the nlra in addition federal and state governmental agency such the national mediation board and the national labor relation board have and may continue to take action that could make it easier for our employee to organize under the rla or nlra finally change to federal or state law governing employee classification could impact the status of fedex ground service provider independent employer of driver if fedex ground is deemed to be an employer or joint employer of the driver of these service provider labor organization could more easily organize these individual our operating cost could increase materially and we could incur significant capital outlay fedex ground relies on service provider to conduct it linehaul and pickup and delivery operation and the status of these service provider direct employer of driver providing these service is being challenged we are defending joint employer case where it is alleged that fedex ground should be treated an employer of the driver employed by service provider engaged by fedex ground we incur certain cost including legal fee in defending the status of service provider engaged by fedex ground direct employer of their driver we continue to believe that fedex ground is not an employer or joint employer of the driver of these independent business however adverse determination in these matter or regulatory development could among other thing entitle service provider driver to certain wage payment from the service provider and fedex ground and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for fedex ground proposed pilot flight and duty time regulation could impair our operation and impose substantial cost on in the faa proposed regulation that would change the flight and duty time rule applicable to all cargo air carrier when the faa issued final regulation in the regulation all cargo carrier including fedex express were exempt from these new requirement instead all cargo carrier were required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rule and allowed to pursue the development of fatigue risk management system to develop fatigue mitigation unique to each operation in the faa reaffirmed the exclusion of all cargo carrier from the regulation and litigation in the court of appeal for the district of columbia affirmed the faa decision however this issue remains policy priority for certain labor group and the congress is currently considering legislation that if adopted would require all cargo carrier to comply with the regulation required compliance with the regulation would make it more difficult to avoid pilot fatigue and could impose substantial cost on in order to maintain operational reliability increasing cost the volatility of cost and funding requirement and other legal mandate for employee benefit especially pension and healthcare benefit could adversely impact our result of operation financial condition and liquidity we sponsor program that provide retirement benefit to most of our employee these program include defined benefit pension plan defined contribution plan and postretirement healthcare plan the cost of providing pension and other retirement benefit plan are dependent on numerous assumption such discount rate investment return on plan asset salary increase expected retirement mortality employee turnover and future increase in healthcare cost change in actuarial assumption and difference between the assumption and actual value well significant decline in the value of investment that fund our pension and other postretirement plan if not offset or mitigated by decline in plan liability could increase pension and other postretirement expense and we could be required from time to time to fund the pension plan with significant amount of cash such cash funding obligation could adversely affect our result of operation and liquidity additionally the rule for pension and retirement benefit plan accounting are complex involve numerous assumption and can produce volatility in our result of operation financial condition and liquidity for example our fourth quarter mark to market mtm retirement plan accounting adjustment resulted in pre tax noncash billion gain million net of tax or per diluted share in and pre tax noncash million loss million net of tax or per diluted share in for additional information on our mtm retirement plan accounting adjustment see item management discussion and analysis of result of operation and financial condition result of operation and outlook consolidated result retirement plan mtm adjustment and note of the consolidated financial statement included in item financial statement and supplementary data of this annual report environmental climate and weather risk we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market response to such change concern over climate change including the impact of global warming ha led to significant and international legislative and regulatory effort to limit ghg emission including our aircraft and vehicle engine emission increasingly state and local government are also considering ghg regulatory requirement compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various country and region are following different approach to the regulation of climate change increased regulation regarding ghg emission especially aircraft or vehicle engine emission could impose substantial cost on especially at fedex express these cost include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital cost associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicle prematurely until the timing scope and extent of such possible regulation becomes known we can not predict it effect on our cost structure or our operating result it is reasonably possible however that it could materially increase our operating expense and have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business if instituted for additional discussion of regulatory response to climate change including corsia and the recent entry into the paris climate accord see item business of this annual report under the caption regulation moreover even without such regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by company in the airline and transportation industry could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our service especially our air express service finally given the broad and global scope of our operation and our susceptibility to global macroeconomic trend we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risk of climate change that could affect all of humankind such shift in weather pattern and world ecosystem we may be unable to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operation by calendar in march we announced goal to achieve carbon neutrality for our global operation by calendar achievement of this goal depends on our execution of operational strategy relating to vehicle electrification development of sustainable customer solution identification and investment in alternative fuel fuel conservation and aircraft modernization program and investment in our facility and natural carbon sequestration execution of these strategy and achievement of our calendar goal is subject to risk and uncertainty many of which are outside of our control these risk and uncertainty include but are not limited to our ability to execute our strategy and achieve our goal within the currently projected cost and the expected timeframes the availability and cost of zero emission electric vehicle alternative fuel fuel efficient aircraft global electrical charging infrastructure off site renewable energy and other material and component unforeseen production design operational and technological difficulty the outcome of research effort and future technology development including the ability to scale project and technology on commercially competitive basis such carbon sequestration and or other related process compliance with and change or addition to global and regional regulation tax charge mandate or requirement relating to ghg emission carbon cost or climate related goal labor related regulation and requirement that restrict or prohibit our ability to impose requirement on third party who provide contracted transportation for our transportation network adapting product to customer preference and customer acceptance of sustainable supply chain solution the action of competitor and competitive pressure and the pace of regional and global recovery from the covid pandemic there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our strategy and achieve our calendar goal of carbon neutrality for our global operation failure to achieve our calendar goal could damage our reputation and customer and other stakeholder relationship further given investor increased focus related to environmental social and governance matter such failure could cause large stockholder to reduce their ownership of fedex common stock and limit our access to financing such condition could have an adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition well on the price of our common stock our inability to quickly and effectively restore operation following adverse weather or localized disaster or disturbance in key geography could adversely impact our business and result of operation while we operate several integrated network with asset distributed throughout the world there are concentration of key asset within our network that are exposed to adverse weather condition or localized risk from natural or manmade disaster such earthquake volcano wildfire hurricane tornado flood severe winter weather conflict or unrest terrorist attack or other disturbance actual or threatened additionally shift in weather pattern caused by climate change could increase the frequency severity or duration of certain adverse weather condition prolonged interruption or disruption at key location such our fedex express memphis world hub or one of our information technology center could adversely impact our business and result of operation we also may incur significant cost to reestablish or relocate these function moreover resulting economic dislocation including supply chain and fuel disruption could adversely impact demand for our service resulting in an adverse effect on our business and result of operation other legal regulatory and miscellaneous risk government regulation and enforcement are evolving and unfavorable change could harm our business we are subject to regulation under wide variety of federal state and local and non government regulation law policy and action there can be no assurance that such regulation law policy and action will not be changed in way that will decrease the demand for our service subject to escalating cost or require to modify our business model and objective harming our financial result in particular legislative regulatory or other action that and non government have undertaken or are considering in area such data privacy and

by those service provider we could be subject to adverse change in regulation and interpretation or challenge to our tax position we are subject to taxation in the and numerous foreign jurisdiction from time to time change in tax law or regulation may be enacted that could significantly affect our overall tax liability and our effective tax rate and foreign governmental agency maintain focus on the taxation of multinational company including statutory tax rate global minimum tax digital tax and transaction between affiliated company such change may require new and complex computation to be

litigation fine sanction or other penalty which could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business result of operation and financial condition this regulatory environment is increasingly challenging and may present material obligation and risk to our business including significantly expanded compliance burden cost and enforcement risk for example the gdpr which became effective in

localization law that require data to stay within their border all of these evolving compliance and operational requirement well the uncertain interpretation and enforcement of law impose significant cost and regulatory risk that are likely to increase over time see failure to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to change in market dynamic and customer preference

salary and employee benefit expense increase in purchased transportation cost and increase in other operating expense higher variable incentive compensation expense also contributed to an increase in salary and employee benefit expense in purchased transportation cost were also higher in primarily due to increased residential service mix at fedex ground in addition other operating expense increased in reflecting higher self insurance accrual at fedex ground fuel the following graph for our transportation segment show our average cost of vehicle and jet fuel per gallon for the year ended may fuel expense decreased during due to lower fuel price fuel price represent only one component of the factor we consider meaningful in understanding the impact of fuel on our business consideration must also be given to the fuel surcharge revenue we collect accordingly we believe discussion of the net impact of fuel on our result which is comparison of the year over year change in these two factor is important to understand the impact of fuel on our business in order to provide information about the impact of fuel surcharge on the trend in revenue and yield growth we have included the comparative weighted average fuel surcharge percentage in effect for and in the accompanying discussion of each of our transportation segment most of our fuel surcharge are adjusted on weekly basis the fuel surcharge is based on weekly fuel price from two week prior to the week in which it is assessed some fedex express international fuel surcharge incorporate timing lag of

on our financial condition or liquidity other business matter on june fedex filed suit in district court in the district of columbia seeking to enjoin the department of commerce the doc from enforcing prohibition contained in the export administration regulation against fedex on september the court granted the doc motion to dismiss the lawsuit on november we appealed this decision critical accounting estimate the preparation of financial statement in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state requires management to make significant judgment and estimate to develop amount reflected and disclosed in the financial statement in many case there are alternative policy or estimation technique that could be used we maintain thorough process to review the application of our accounting policy and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimate that are required to prepare the financial statement of complex global corporation however even under optimal circumstance estimate routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstance and new or better information the estimate discussed below include the financial statement element that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policy and are material to our financial statement management ha discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of director and with our independent registered public accounting firm retirement plan overview we sponsor program that provide retirement benefit to most of our employee these program include defined benefit pension plan defined contribution plan and postretirement healthcare plan and are described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement the rule for pension accounting are complex and can produce volatility in our earnings financial condition and liquidity we are required to record annual year end adjustment to our financial statement for the net funded status of our defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plan the funded status of our plan also impact our liquidity however the cash funding rule operate under completely different set of assumption and standard than those used for financial reporting purpose result our actual cash funding requirement can differ materially from our reported funded status over the past several year we have taken numerous action to reduce pension related risk and expense including the introduction of our portable pension account benefit freezing our traditional pension benefit employing liability driven investment strategy permitting certain former employee with traditional pension benefit to make one time irrevocable election to receive their benefit in lump sum distribution and transferring approximately billion of our pension plan obligation to metropolitan life insurance company in we announced the closing of our based defined benefit pension plan to new non union employee hired on or after january we will introduce an all plan retirement benefit structure for eligible employee with higher company match of up to across all based operating company in during calendar current eligible employee under the portable pension account ppa pension formula will be given one time option to continue to be eligible for pension compensation credit under the existing ppa formula and remain in the existing plan with it company match of up to or to cease receiving compensation credit under the ppa and move to the new plan with the higher company match of up to change to the new plan structure become effective beginning january while this new program will provide employee greater flexibility and reduce our long term pension cost it will not have material impact on current or near term financial result the salary and employee benefit caption of our accompanying consolidated income statement includes retirement plan expense associated with service cost the other retirement plan income expense caption of our accompanying consolidated income statement includes our fourth quarter mtm adjustment expense associated with prior service and interest cost the expected return on asset eroa and settlement the retirement plan mtm adjustment for also include the mtm retirement plan accounting adjustment related to amendment to the tnt express netherlands pension plan summary of our retirement plan cost affecting our financial result over the past two year is follows in million expense affecting operating income defined benefit pension plan postretirement healthcare plan defined contribution plan item affecting other income expense retirement plan interest other retirement plan mtm adjustment the component of the mtm adjustment are follows presented gain loss in million actual versus expected return on asset discount rate change demographic experience current year actuarial loss change in future assumption curtailment gain on tnt netherlands pension plan total mtm gain loss service cost for our defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plan wa million in and million in and is expected to be approximately million in net of all fee and expense the actual rate of return on our pension plan asset wa which wa higher than our expected return of positive portfolio return derived from our return seeking asset were partially offset by loss from our fixed income asset due to rising long term interest rate the weighted average discount rate for all our pension and postretirement healthcare plan increased six basis point from at may to at may the demographic experience in reflects an update to our mortality and retirement rate assumption and current year actuarial loss due to unfavorable experience compared to various demographic assumption the weighted average discount rate for all our pension and postretirement healthcare plan decreased basis point from at may to at may the demographic experience in reflects an update to our mortality assumption and current year actuarial loss due to unfavorable experience compared to various demographic assumption the actual rate of return which is net of all fee and expense on our pension plan asset of wa higher than our expected return of return seeking asset primarily equity were positive despite equity market volatility additionally fixed income asset performed expected interest rate declined discount rate the discount rate is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payment that have been accrued to date the projected benefit obligation or pbo to their net present value and to determine the succeeding year ongoing pension expense prior to any year end mtm adjustment the discount rate is determined each year at the plan measurement date the discount rate for our pension plan at each measurement date wa follows measurement date discount rate we determine the discount rate with the assistance of actuary who calculate the yield on theoretical portfolio of high grade corporate bond rated aa or better in developing this theoretical portfolio we select bond that match cash flow to benefit payment limit our concentration by industry and issuer and apply screening criterion to ensure bond with call feature have low probability of being called to the extent scheduled bond proceeds exceed the estimated benefit payment in given period the calculation assumes those excess proceeds are reinvested at one year forward rate the measurement of our pbo and the related impact on our annual mtm adjustment is highly sensitive to the discount rate assumption for our largest pension plan basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased our pbo by approximately billion and basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased our pbo by approximately billion however our annual net pension expense is le sensitive to change in the discount rate for example one basis point increase in the discount rate for our largest pension plan would have million effect on the fourth quarter mtm adjustment but only net million impact on net pension expense plan asset the expected average rate of return on plan asset is long term forward looking assumption it is required to be the expected future long term rate of earnings on plan asset our pension plan asset are invested primarily in publicly tradable security and our pension plan hold only minimal investment in fedex common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third party pension fund investment manager part of our strategy to manage pension cost and funded status volatility we follow liability driven investment strategy to better align plan asset with liability establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension asset is judgmental matter which we review on an annual basis and revise appropriate management considers the following factor in determining this assumption the duration of our pension plan liability which drive the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan asset the type of investment class in which we invest our pension plan asset and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment class to earn over time net of all fee and expense and the investment return we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the return we could expect if investment were made strictly in indexed fund for consolidated pension expense we assumed expected long term rate of return on our pension plan asset in and for we have decreased our eroa assumption to due to the significant increase in administrative expense payable from the pension trust due to higher pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc variable rate premium vrp and based on our long term outlook for the capital market the higher pbgc vrp resulted in basis point lower rate of return compared to the historical annual return on our pension plan asset calculated on compound geometric basis wa net of all fee and expense for the year period ended may for our pension plan one basis point change in our eroa would impact our pension expense by million funded status the following is information concerning the funded status of our pension plan of may on financial reporting basis in million funded status of plan projected benefit obligation pbo fair value of plan asset funded status of the plan cash amount cash contribution during the year benefit payment during the year funding the funding requirement for our pension plan are governed by the pension protection act of which ha aggressive funding requirement in order to avoid benefit payment restriction that become effective if the funded status determined under irs rule fall below at the beginning of plan year all of our pension plan have funded status level in excess of and our plan are fully funded under the employee retirement income security act erisa additionally current benefit payment do not materially impact our total plan asset benefit payment for our pension plan for were approximately million or of plan asset over the past several year we have made voluntary contribution to our pension plan in excess of the minimum required contribution for no pension contribution are required for our pension plan they are fully funded under erisa however we expect to make voluntary contribution of million to these plan in see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement for further information about our retirement plan income tax we are subject to income tax in the and numerous foreign jurisdiction our income tax are function of our income statutory tax rate and tax planning opportunity available to in the various jurisdiction in which we operate the tax law in the various jurisdiction are complex and subject to different interpretation by and the respective governmental taxing authority result significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax position including evaluating uncertainty also our effective tax rate is significantly affected by the earnings generated in each jurisdiction so unexpected fluctuation in the geographic mix of earnings could significantly impact our tax rate our intercompany transaction are based on globally accepted transfer pricing principle which align profit with the business operation and function of the various legal entity in our international business we evaluate our tax position quarterly and adjust the balance new information becomes available these evaluation are based on factor including but not limited to change in fact or circumstance change in tax law or their interpretation audit activity and change in our business in addition management considers the advice of third party in making conclusion regarding tax consequence tax contingency arise from uncertainty in the application of tax rule throughout the many jurisdiction in which we operate despite our belief that our tax return position are consistent with applicable tax law taxing authority could challenge certain position we record tax benefit for uncertain tax position based upon management evaluation of the information available at the reporting date to be recognized in the financial statement tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on the technical merit the benefit for position meeting the recognition threshold is measured the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with taxing authority that ha full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required in making these determination and adjustment to unrecognized tax benefit may be necessary to reflect actual tax payable upon settlement deferred income tax asset represent amount available to reduce income tax payable on taxable income in future year such asset arise because of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability well from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deduction and credit by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategy these source of income rely heavily on estimate to make this determination so there is risk that these estimate will have to be revised new information is received to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that deferred tax asset will be recovered valuation allowance is established we believe we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefit related to the remaining net deferred tax asset in our consolidated balance sheet that are not subject to valuation allowance we record the tax for global intangible low taxed income period cost our income tax position are based on currently enacted tax law including the tcja and the care act further guidance is issued by the treasury department the irs and other standard setting body any resulting change to our estimate will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance for more information including impact from the tcja and the care act see the income tax section of this md and note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement self insurance accrual we are self insured up to certain limit for cost associated with worker compensation claim vehicle accident property and cargo loss general business liability and benefit paid under employee healthcare and disability program our reserve are established for estimate of loss on all incurred claim including incurred but not reported claim self insurance accrual reflected in our balance sheet were billion at may and billion at may approximately of these accrual were classified current liability our self insurance accrual are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claim incurred of the balance sheet date these estimate include consideration of factor such severity of claim frequency and volume of claim healthcare inflation seasonality and plan design cost trend on material accrual are updated each quarter we self insure up to certain limit that vary by type of risk periodically we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance level based on risk tolerance and premium expense we believe the use of actuarial method to account for these liability provides consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accrual however the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claim involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known we believe our recorded obligation for these expense are consistently measured on conservative basis nevertheless change in healthcare cost accident frequency and severity insurance retention level and other factor can materially affect the estimate for these liability long lived asset useful life and salvage value our business is capital intensive with approximately of our owned asset invested in our transportation and information system infrastructure the depreciation or amortization of our capital asset over their estimated useful life and the determination of any salvage value requires management to make judgment about future event because we utilize many of our capital asset over relatively long period the majority of aircraft cost are depreciated over to year we periodically evaluate whether adjustment to our estimated service life or salvage value are necessary to ensure these estimate properly match the economic use of the asset this evaluation may result in change in the estimated life and residual value used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment for our aircraft we typically assign no residual value due to the utilization of these asset in cargo configuration which result in little to no value at the end of their useful life these estimate affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in period and ultimately the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset change in the estimated life of asset will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future period and could have material impact on our result of operation described below historically gain and loss on disposal of operating equipment have not been material however such amount may differ materially in the future due to change in business level technological obsolescence accident frequency regulatory change and other factor beyond our control impairment of may the fedex express global air network included fleet of aircraft including approximately supplemental aircraft that provide delivery of package and freight to more than country and territory through wide range of and international shipping service while certain aircraft are utilized in primary geographic area versus international we operate an integrated global network and utilize our aircraft and other mode of transportation to achieve the lowest cost of delivery while maintaining our service commitment to our customer because of the integrated nature of our global network our aircraft are interchangeable across route and geography giving flexibility with our fleet planning to meet changing global economic condition and maintain and modify aircraft needed because of the lengthy lead time for aircraft manufacture and modification we must anticipate volume level and plan our fleet requirement year in advance and make commitment for aircraft based on those projection furthermore the timing and availability of certain used aircraft type particularly those with better fuel efficiency may create limited opportunity to acquire these aircraft at favorable price in advance of our capacity need these activity create risk that asset capacity may exceed demand at may we had three purchased aircraft that were not yet placed into service the accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with it estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the cash flow do not exceed the carrying value the asset must be adjusted to it current fair value we operate integrated transportation network and accordingly cash flow for most of our operating asset are assessed at network level not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment further decision about capital investment are evaluated based on the impact to the overall network rather than the return on an individual asset we make decision to remove certain long lived asset from service based on projection of reduced capacity need or lower operating cost of newer aircraft type and those decision may result in an impairment charge asset held for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair value le cost to sell when the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criterion are met the fair value determination for such aircraft may require management estimate there may not be active market for some of these aircraft such estimate are subject to revision from period to period in the normal management of our aircraft fleet we routinely idle aircraft and engine temporarily due to maintenance cycle and adjustment of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand level temporarily idled asset are classified available for use and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these asset these temporarily idled asset are assessed for impairment and remaining life on quarterly basis the criterion for determining whether an asset ha been permanently removed from service and result is potentially impaired include but are not limited to our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume level including capacity need during our peak shipping season the introduction of new fleet type or decision to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operation and change to planned service expansion activity at may we had nine aircraft temporarily idled these aircraft have been idled for an average of month and are expected to return to revenue service in order to meet expected demand during we made the decision to permanently retire from service airbus aircraft and related engine at fedex express to align with the need of the domestic network and modernize it aircraft fleet consequence of this decision we recognized noncash impairment charge of million million net of tax or per diluted share in the fedex express segment in lease we utilize operating lease to finance certain of our aircraft facility and equipment such arrangement typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the asset at the end of the lease period to the lessor in accordance with the new lease accounting standard adopted june we had approximately billion in operating lease liability and approximately billion related right of use asset on the balance sheet of may the weighted average remaining lease term of all operating lease outstanding at may wa approximately year our lease generally contain option to extend or terminate the lease we reevaluate our lease on regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentive of exercising the renewal option and how they align with our operating strategy therefore substantially all the renewal option period are not included within the lease term and the associated payment are not included in the measurement of the right of use asset and lease liability the option to extend are not reasonably certain at lease commencement short term lease with an initial term of month or le are not recognized in the right to use asset and lease liability on the consolidated balance sheet the lease liability are measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the minimum lease payment not yet paid and our incremental borrowing rate which approximates the rate at which we would borrow on collateralized basis over the term of lease in the applicable currency environment the interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not determinable in transaction where we are the lessee the determination of whether lease is accounted for finance lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimate primarily about the fair value of the asset and it estimated economic useful life in addition our evaluation includes ensuring we properly account for build to suit lease arrangement and making judgment about whether various form of lessee involvement during the construction period allow the lessee to control the underlying leased asset during the construction period we believe we have well defined and controlled process for making these evaluation including obtaining third party appraisal for material transaction to assist in making these evaluation goodwill we had billion of recorded goodwill at may and billion of recorded goodwill at may from our business acquisition representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net asset acquired several factor give rise to goodwill in our acquisition such the expected benefit from synergy of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment in our evaluation of goodwill impairment we perform qualitative assessment that requires management judgment and the use of estimate to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount an entity ha an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test an entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period we performed both qualitative and quantitative assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of and this included comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying value including attributable goodwill fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodology principally the income or market approach classified level within the fair value hierarchy incorporating market participant consideration and management assumption on revenue growth rate operating margin discount rate and expected capital expenditure estimate used by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test change in forecasted operating result and other assumption could materially affect these estimate our reporting unit with significant recorded goodwill include fedex express fedex ground and fedex freight we evaluated these reporting unit during the fourth quarter of and and the estimated fair value of each of these reporting unit exceeded their carrying value of the end of and therefore we do not believe that any of these reporting unit were impaired of the balance sheet date in connection with our annual impairment testing of goodwill conducted in the fourth quarter of we recorded impairment charge of million predominantly attributable to our fedex office reporting unit the covid pandemic resulted in store closure and declining print revenue at fedex office during the fourth quarter of which negatively impacted it near term operating performance based on these factor our outlook for the fedex office business and retail industry changed in the fourth quarter of legal and other contingency we are subject to various loss contingency in connection with our operation contingent liability are difficult to measure their measurement is subject to multiple factor that are not easily predicted or projected further additional complexity in measuring these liability arises due to the various jurisdiction in which these matter occur which make our ability to predict their outcome highly uncertain moreover different accounting rule must be employed to account for these item based on the nature of the contingency accordingly significant management judgment is required to ass these matter and to make determination about the measurement of liability if any certain pending loss contingency are described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement in the opinion of management the aggregate liability if any of individual matter or group of related matter not specifically described in note is not expected to be material to our financial position result of operation or cash flow the following describes our method and associated process for evaluating these matter because of the complex environment in which we operate we are subject to numerous legal proceeding and claim including those relating to general commercial matter governmental enforcement action employment related claim and fedex ground service provider accounting guidance for contingency requires an accrual of estimated loss from contingency such non income tax or other legal proceeding or claim when it is probable the future event or event are likely to occur that loss ha been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated this guidance also requires disclosure of loss contingency matter when in management judgment material loss is reasonably possible or probable during the preparation of our financial statement we evaluate our contingency to determine whether it is probable reasonably possible or remote that liability ha been incurred loss is recognized for all contingency deemed probable and estimable regardless of amount for unresolved contingency with potentially material exposure that are deemed reasonably possible we evaluate whether potential loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated our evaluation of these matter is the result of comprehensive process designed to ensure that accounting recognition of loss or disclosure of these contingency is made in timely manner and involves our legal and accounting personnel well external counsel where applicable the process includes regular communication during each quarter and scheduled meeting shortly before the completion of our financial statement to evaluate any new legal proceeding and the status of existing matter in determining whether loss should be accrued or loss contingency disclosed we evaluate among other factor the current status of each matter within the scope and context of the entire lawsuit or proceeding the lengthy and complex nature of class action matter the procedural status of each matter any opportunity to dispose of lawsuit on it merit before trial motion to dismiss or for summary judgment the amount of time remaining before trial date the status of discovery the status of settlement arbitration or mediation proceeding and our judgment regarding the likelihood of success prior to or at trial in reaching our conclusion with respect to accrual of loss or loss contingency disclosure we take holistic view of each matter based on these factor and the information available prior to the issuance of our financial statement uncertainty with respect to an individual factor or combination of these factor may impact our decision related to accrual or disclosure of loss contingency including conclusion that we are unable to establish an estimate of possible loss or meaningful range of possible loss we update our disclosure to reflect our most current understanding of the contingency at the time we issue our financial statement however event may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of contingency may result in loss to that differs materially from our previously estimated liability or range of possible loss despite the inherent complexity in the accounting and disclosure of contingency we believe that our process are robust and thorough and provide consistent framework for management in evaluating the potential outcome of contingency for proper accounting recognition and disclosure item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate while we currently have market risk sensitive instrument related to interest rate we do not have significant exposure to changing interest rate on our long term debt disclosed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statement we had outstanding fixed rate long term debt exclusive of finance lease with an estimated fair value of billion at may and outstanding fixed and floating rate long term debt exclusive of finance lease with an estimated fair value of billion at may market risk for long term debt is estimated the potential decrease in fair value resulting from hypothetical increase in interest rate and amount to approximately million of may and approximately million of may the underlying fair value of our long term debt were estimated based on quoted market price or on the current rate offered for debt with similar term and maturity we have interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligation change in interest rate impact our liability associated with these retirement plan well the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized decline in the value of plan asset could diminish the funded status of our pension plan and potentially increase our requirement to make contribution to the plan substantial investment loss on plan asset would also increase net pension expense foreign currency while we are global provider of transportation commerce and business service the majority of our transaction during the period presented in this annual report are denominated in dollar the principal foreign currency exchange rate risk to which we are exposed are in the euro chinese yuan british pound canadian dollar australian dollar hong kong dollar mexican peso japanese yen and brazilian real historically our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation is more significant with respect to our revenue than our expense significant portion of our expense are denominated in dollar such aircraft and fuel expense foreign currency fluctuation had slightly negative impact on operating income in and slightly positive impact on operating income in however favorable foreign currency fluctuation also may have had an offsetting impact on the price we obtained or the demand for our service which is not quantifiable at may the result of uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currency in which our transaction are denominated would result in an increase in expected operating income of million for this theoretical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the dollar which is not consistent with our actual experience in foreign currency transaction in addition to the direct effect of change in exchange rate fluctuation in exchange rate also affect the volume of sale or the foreign currency sale price competitor service become more or le attractive the sensitivity analysis of the effect of change in foreign currency exchange rate doe not factor in potential change in sale level or local currency price we maintain derivative financial instrument to manage foreign currency fluctuation related to probable future transaction and cash flow denominated in currency other than the currency of the transacting entity which impact our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk these derivative are not designated hedge and are accounted for at fair value with any profit or loss recorded in income which wa immaterial for and commodity while we have market risk for change in the price of jet and vehicle fuel this risk is largely mitigated by our indexed fuel surcharge for additional

description of the matter at may the company aggregated projected benefit obligation for pension plan wa billion and exceeded the billion fair value of pension plan asset resulting in an unfunded pension obligation of billion the net periodic benefit income for the year ended may for the pension plan wa billion explained in note to the consolidated financial statement the company sponsor defined benefit pension plan that provide retirement benefit to certain employee the company projected benefit obligation for the pension plan are measured using actuarial technique that reflect management assumption for discount rate future salary increase employee turnover mortality and retirement age auditing the projected benefit obligation for the pension plan wa complex due to the highly judgmental nature and significant effect of the discount rate used in the measurement process the discount rate is developed by utilizing the yield on theoretical portfolio of high grade corporate bond that match cash flow to benefit payment limit the concentration by industry and issuer and apply screening criterion to exclude bond with call feature unless they have low probability of being called how we addressed the matter in our audit we obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of control over management process for estimating the

reportable segment our fedex service segment provides sale marketing information technology communication customer service technical support billing and collection service and certain back office function that support our operating segment fiscal year except otherwise specified reference to year indicate our fiscal year ended may or ended may of the year referenced principle of consolidation the consolidated financial statement include the account of fedex and it subsidiary substantially all of which are wholly owned all significant intercompany account and transaction have been eliminated in consolidation revenue recognition satisfaction of performance obligation performance obligation is promise in contract to transfer distinct good or service to the customer and is the basis of revenue recognition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle gaap to determine the proper revenue recognition method for contract we evaluate whether two or more contract should be combined and accounted for one single contract and whether the combined or single contract should be accounted for more than one performance obligation for most of our contract the customer contract with to provide distinct service within single contract primarily transportation service substantially all of our contract with customer for transportation service include only one performance obligation the transportation service themselves however if contract is separated into more than one performance obligation we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling price of the promised good or service underlying each performance obligation we frequently sell standard transportation service with observable standalone sale price in these instance the observable standalone sale are used to determine the standalone selling price for transportation service revenue is recognized over time we perform the service in the contract because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer our customer receive the benefit of our service the good are transported from one location to another if we were unable to complete delivery to the final location another entity would not need to reperform the transportation service already performed control transfer over time revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the product or service to be provided we use the cost to cost measure of progress for our package delivery contract because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs we incur cost on our contract under the cost to cost measure of progress the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of cost incurred to date to the total estimated cost at completion of the performance obligation revenue including ancillary or accessorial fee and reduction for estimated customer incentive is recorded proportionally cost are incurred cost to fulfill include labor and other direct cost and an allocation of indirect cost for our fedex freight and freight forwarding contract an output method of progress based on time in transit is utilized the timing of cost incurred doe not best depict the transfer of control to the customer we also provide customized customer specific solution such supply chain management solution and inventory and service part logistics through which we provide the service of integrating complex set of task and component into single capability for these arrangement the majority of which are conducted by our fedex logistics inc fedex logistics operating segment the entire contract is accounted for one performance obligation for these performance obligation we typically have right to consideration from customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance completed to date and such we recognize revenue in the amount to which we have right to invoice the customer fedex corporation note to consolidated financial statement contract modification contract are often modified to account for change in the rate we charge our customer or to add additional distinct service we consider contract modification to exist when the modification either creates new enforceable right and obligation or alters the existing arrangement contract modification that add distinct good or service are treated separate contract contract modification that do not add distinct good or service typically change the price of existing service these contract modification are accounted for prospectively the remaining performance obligation are distinct variable consideration certain contract contain customer incentive guaranteed service refund and other provision that can either increase or decrease the transaction price these incentive are generally awarded based upon achieving certain performance metric we estimate variable consideration the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled we include estimated amount of revenue which may be reduced by incentive or other contract provision in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved our estimate of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amount in the transaction price are based on an assessment of anticipated customer spending and all information historical current and forecasted that is reasonably available to principal agent consideration transportation service are provided with the use of employee and independent business that contract with fedex gaap requires to evaluate whether our business themselves promise to transfer service to the customer the principal or to arrange for service to be provided by another party the agent using control model based on our evaluation of the control model we determined that fedex is the principal to the transaction for most of these service and revenue is recognized on gross basis based on the transfer of control to the customer cost associated with independent business providing transportation service are recognized incurred and included in the caption purchased transportation in the accompanying consolidated statement of income our contract logistics global trade service and certain transportation business engage in certain transaction wherein they act agent revenue from these transaction is recorded on net basis net revenue includes billing to customer le third party charge including transportation or handling cost fee commission and tax and duty contract asset and liability contract asset include billed and unbilled amount resulting from in transit shipment we have an unconditional right to payment only once all performance obligation have been completed package have been delivered contract asset are generally classified current and the full balance is converted each quarter based on the short term nature of the transaction our contract liability consist of advance payment and billing in excess of revenue the full balance of deferred revenue is converted each quarter based on the short term nature of the transaction gross contract asset related to in transit shipment totaled million and million at may and may respectively contract asset net of deferred unearned revenue were million and million at may and may respectively contract asset are included within current asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet contract liability related to advance payment from customer were million and million at may and may respectively contract liability are included within current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet payment term certain of our revenue producing transaction are subject to tax and duty such sale tax assessed by governmental authority we present these revenue net of tax under the typical payment term of our customer contract the customer pay at periodic interval every day day day etc for shipment included on invoice received it is not customary business practice to extend payment term past day and such we do not have practice of including significant financing component within our revenue contract with customer disaggregation of revenue see note for disclosure of disaggregated revenue for the period ended may this presentation is consistent with how we organize our segment internally for making operating decision and measuring performance fedex corporation note to consolidated financial statement credit risk we routinely grant credit to many of our customer for transportation and business service without collateral the risk of credit loss in our trade receivables is substantially mitigated by our credit evaluation process short collection term and sale to large number of customer well the low revenue per transaction for most of our service allowance for potential credit loss are determined based on historical experience and the impact of current economic condition historically credit loss have been within management expectation advertising advertising and promotion cost are expensed incurred and are classified in other operating expense advertising and promotion expense were million in million in and million in cash equivalent cash in excess of current operating requirement is invested in short term interest bearing instrument with maturity of three month or le at the date of purchase and is stated at cost which approximates market value spare part supply and fuel spare part principally aircraft related are reported at weighted average cost allowance for obsolescence are provided for spare part currently identified excess or obsolete well expected to be on hand at the date the aircraft are retired from service these allowance are provided over the estimated useful life of the related aircraft and engine the majority of our supply and fuel are reported at weighted average cost property and equipment expenditure for major addition improvement and flight equipment modification are capitalized when such cost are determined to extend the useful life of the asset or are part of the cost of acquiring the asset expenditure for equipment overhaul cost of engine or airframe prior to their operational use are capitalized part of the cost of such asset they are cost required to ready the asset for it intended use maintenance and repair cost are charged to expense incurred except for certain aircraft engine maintenance cost incurred under third party service agreement these agreement result in cost being expensed based on cycle or hour flown and are subject to annual escalation these service contract transfer risk to third party service provider and generally fix the amount we pay for maintenance to the service provider rate per cycle or flight hour in exchange for maintenance and repair under predefined maintenance program we capitalize certain direct internal and external cost associated with the development of internal use software including implementation of cloud computing service arrangement gain and loss on sale of property used in operation are classified within operating expense and historically have been nominal for financial reporting purpose we record depreciation and amortization of property and equipment on straight line basis over the asset service life or related lease term if shorter for income tax purpose depreciation is computed using accelerated method when applicable the depreciable life and net book value of our property and equipment are follows dollar in million net book value at may range wide body aircraft and related equipment to year narrow body and feeder aircraft and related equipment to year package handling and ground support equipment to year information technology to year vehicle and trailer to year facility and other to year substantially all property and equipment have no material residual value the majority of aircraft cost are depreciated on straight line basis over to

property and equipment used in operation wa billion in billion in and billion in depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of asset under finance lease capitalized interest interest on fund used to finance the acquisition and modification of aircraft including purchase deposit construction of certain facility and development of certain software up to the date the asset is ready

to consolidated financial statement impairment of long lived asset long lived asset are reviewed for impairment when circumstance indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable for asset that are to be held and used an impairment is recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flow associated with the asset or group of asset is le than their carrying value if impairment exists an adjustment is made to write the asset down to it fair value and loss is recorded the difference between the carrying value and fair value fair value are determined based on quoted market value discounted cash flow or internal and external appraisal applicable asset to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value we operate integrated transportation network so cash flow for most of our operating asset to be held and used are assessed at network level not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment during we made the decision to permanently retire from service airbus aircraft and related engine at fedex express to align with the need of the domestic network and modernize it aircraft fleet consequence of this decision we recognized noncash impairment charge of million million net of tax or per diluted share in the fedex express segment in in the normal management of our aircraft fleet we routinely idle aircraft and engine temporarily due to maintenance cycle and adjustment of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand level temporarily idled asset are classified available for use and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these asset these temporarily idled asset are assessed for impairment and remaining life on quarterly basis the criterion for determining whether an asset ha been permanently removed from service and result is potentially impaired include but are not limited to our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume level including capacity need during our peak shipping season the introduction of new fleet type or decision to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operation and change to planned service expansion activity at may we had nine aircraft temporarily idled these aircraft have been idled for an average of month and are expected to return to revenue service goodwill goodwill is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net asset of business acquired several factor give rise to goodwill in our acquisition such the expected benefit from synergy of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment in our evaluation of goodwill impairment we perform qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive we proceed to test goodwill for impairment including comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying value including attributable goodwill fair value for our reporting unit is determined using an income or market approach incorporating market participant consideration and management assumption on revenue growth rate operating margin discount rate and expected capital expenditure fair value determination may include both internal and third party valuation unless circumstance otherwise dictate we perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter see note for additional information intangible asset intangible asset primarily include customer relationship technology asset and trademark acquired in business combination intangible asset are amortized over period ranging from to year either on straight line basis or on basis consistent with the pattern in which the economic benefit are realized see note for additional information pension and postretirement healthcare plan our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan are measured using actuarial technique that reflect management assumption for discount rate investment return on plan asset salary increase expected retirement mortality employee turnover and future increase in healthcare cost we determine the discount rate which is required to be the rate at which the projected benefit obligation pbo could be effectively settled of the measurement date with the assistance of actuary who calculate the yield on theoretical portfolio of high grade corporate bond rated aa or better with cash flow that are designed to match our expected benefit payment in future year we use the fair value of plan asset to calculate the expected return on asset eroa for interim and segment reporting purpose our eroa is judgmental estimate which is reviewed on an annual basis and revised appropriate the accounting guidance related to employer accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of these plan we use mark to market or mtm accounting and immediately recognize change in the fair value of plan asset and actuarial gain or loss in our result annually in the fourth quarter each year the annual mtm adjustment is recognized at the corporate level and doe not impact segment result the remaining component of pension and postretirement healthcare expense primarily service and interest cost and the eroa are recorded on quarterly basis only service cost is recognized in segment level operating result income tax deferred income tax are provided for the tax effect of temporary difference between the tax basis of asset and liability and their reported amount in the financial statement the liability method is used to account for income tax which requires deferred tax to be recorded at the statutory rate expected to be in effect when the tax are paid fedex corporation note to consolidated financial statement deferred income tax asset represent amount available to reduce income tax payable on taxable income in future year such asset arise because of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability well from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deduction and credit by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategy these source of income rely heavily on estimate to make this determination and thus there is risk that these estimate will have to be revised new information is received to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that deferred tax asset will be recovered valuation allowance is established we believe we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefit related to the remaining net deferred tax asset in our consolidated balance sheet that are not subject to valuation allowance we record the tax for global intangible low taxed income period cost we recognize liability for uncertain income tax position based on two step process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any the second step requires to estimate and measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amount we must determine the probability of various possible outcome we reevaluate these uncertain tax position on quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management these reevaluation are based on factor including but not limited to change in fact or circumstance change in tax law successfully settled issue under audit and new audit activity such change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of tax benefit or an increase to the related provision we classify interest related to income tax liability interest expense and if applicable penalty are recognized component of income tax expense the income tax liability and accrued interest and penalty that are due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented current liability the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability and accrued interest and penalty are recorded in the caption other liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet self insurance accrual we are self insured for cost associated with worker compensation claim vehicle accident property and cargo loss general business liability and benefit paid under employee healthcare and disability program accrual are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claim which includes incurred but not reported claim current worker compensation claim vehicle and general liability employee healthcare claim and long term disability are included in accrued expense we self insure up to certain limit that vary by operating company and type of risk claim cost are recognized on gross basis and receivable is recorded for amount covered by third party insurance periodically we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance level based on risk tolerance and premium expense lease we lease certain facility aircraft equipment and vehicle under operating and finance lease determination of whether contract contains lease is made at the inception of the arrangement our leased facility include national regional and metropolitan sorting facility retail facility and administrative building our lease generally contain option to extend or terminate the lease we reevaluate our lease on regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentive of exercising the renewal option and how they align with our operating strategy therefore substantially all the renewal option period are not included within the lease term and the associated payment are not included in the measurement of the right of use asset and lease liability the option to extend are not reasonably certain at lease commencement short term lease with an initial term of month or le are not recognized in the right to use asset and lease liability on the consolidated balance sheet the lease liability are measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the minimum lease payment not yet paid and our incremental borrowing rate which approximates the rate at which we would borrow on collateralized basis over the term of lease in the applicable currency environment the interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not determinable in transaction where we are the lessee for real estate lease we account for lease component and non lease component such common area maintenance single lease component certain real estate lease require additional payment based on sale volume and index based rate increase well reimbursement for real estate tax common area maintenance and insurance which are expensed incurred variable lease cost certain lease contain fixed lease payment for item such real estate tax common area maintenance and insurance these fixed payment are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right of use asset and lease liability see note for

of our financial statement recently adopted accounting standard in june the financial accounting standard board fasb issued asu that amends the impairment model for most financial asset and certain other instrument that are not measured at fair value through net income including trade receivables to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the incurred loss methodology we adopted this standard effective june we updated our process for estimating the expected credit loss to include review of forecast information that may impact expected collectability over the lifetime of the asset see note for additional information the adoption of this standard did not have material impact on our consolidated financial statement and related disclosure in august the fasb issued asu that reduces the complexity of accounting for cost of implementing cloud computing service arrangement and aligns the accounting for capitalizing implementation cost of hosting arrangement regardless of whether they convey license to the hosted software we adopted this standard effective june and applied these change prospectively the adoption of this standard did not have material impact on our consolidated

investment strategy to better align plan asset with liability fedex corporation note to consolidated financial statement establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension asset is judgmental matter which we review on an annual basis and revise appropriate management considers the following factor in determining this assumption the duration of our pension plan liability which drive the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan asset the type of investment class in which we invest our pension plan asset and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment class to earn over time net of all fee and expense and the investment return we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the return we could expect if investment were made strictly in indexed fund for consolidated pension expense we assumed expected long term rate of return on our pension plan asset in and for we have decreased our eroa assumption to due to the significant increase in administrative expense payable from the pension trust due to higher pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc variable rate premium

calculated on compound geometric basis wa net of all fee and expense for the year period ended may the investment strategy for our pension plan asset is to utilize diversified mix of public equity fixed income and alternative investment to earn long term investment return that meet our pension plan obligation our largest asset class are corporate fixed income security and government fixed income security which are largely benchmarked against the barclays long government barclays long corporate or the citigroup strip index and and non equity which are mainly benchmarked to the index and msci index accordingly we do not have any significant concentration of risk active management strategy are utilized within the plan in an effort to realize investment return in excess of market index our investment strategy also includes the limited use of derivative financial instrument on discretionary basis to improve investment return and manage portfolio risk the following is description of

at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which the individual security are traded fixed income we determine the fair value of level corporate bond and non government security and other fixed income security by using bid evaluation pricing model or quoted price of security with similar characteristic alternative investment the valuation of level investment requires significant judgment due to the absence of quoted market price the inherent lack of liquidity and the long term nature of such asset investment in private equity debt real estate hedge fund and other
