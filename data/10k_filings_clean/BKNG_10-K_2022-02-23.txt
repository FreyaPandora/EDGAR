obligation under our contract with payment card processor including the payment card industry data security standard compliance with which is complex and costly for further discussion of these regulation and how other global regulation may impact our business see part item risk factor legal tax regulatory compliance and reputational risk operation and technology our business is supported by multiple system and platform which were designed with an emphasis on scalability performance reliability redundancy and security these system and platform are generally independent among our brand though some have become more connected or shared over time our software system platform and architecture use variety of widely used software tool and database system we are modernizing our technology by building new application with modern development tool and application programming interface and moving certain system and data to public cloud infrastructure these internal system and platform are designed to include open application protocol interface that can provide connectivity to vendor in the industry in which we operate these include large global system such accommodation flight and rental car reservation system and financial service provider well individual accommodation service provider such independent hotel our application utilize digital certificate to help conduct secure communication and transaction appropriate the system infrastructure and web and database server of our worldwide operation are primarily hosted in the united kingdom switzerland the netherlands germany singapore hong kong and four location in the united state each of which provides network connectivity networking infrastructure and hour monitoring and engineering support typical of hosted data center all data center facility have continuous power supply system generator redundant server and multiple back system although we take step to mitigate the effect of any loss or reduction in service at one of our hosting facility if hosting facility were inaccessible or otherwise experienced disruption in service for any reason we could experience disruption to our service loss of transaction and revenue and consumer complaint we provide customer service through mix of in house call center and outsourced third party service property over time and through acquisition we have assembled portfolio of patent trademark service mark copyright domain name and trade secret covering our service we regard the protection of our intellectual property important to our success we protect our intellectual property right by relying on national federal state and common law right well variety of administrative procedure regulation convention and treaty throughout the world we also rely on contractual restriction to protect our proprietary right we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreement with employee and contractor and nondisclosure agreement with party with which we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information we also have procured intellectual property license from third party see part item risk factor we face risk related to our intellectual property seasonality and other timing factorsprior to the covid pandemic our gross booking were generally similar in the first three quarter of the year and higher than in the fourth quarter we generally recognize our marketing activity the expense is incurred which is typically in the quarter when the gross booking for the associated reservation are recognized however we would generally recognize revenue from these booking when the travel begin at check in and accommodation check in in europe and north america are generally highest in the third quarter during those region peak summer travel season and lowest in the first quarter result of this timing difference between when we record marketing expense and when we generally recognize associated revenue we typically experience our highest level of profitability in the third quarter and our lowest level of profitability in the first quarter in addition to the typical seasonality effect on our business our quarterly result and quarterly year over year growth rate can be impacted by the length of the booking window the average time between the booking of travel reservation and when the travel begin which impact the relationship between our gross booking recognized at the time of booking and our revenue recognized at the time of check in the level of acceleration or deceleration in the gross booking growth rate for example our operating margin are typically negatively impacted in the near term from gross booking and related variable marketing expense growth acceleration revenue growth is typically le impacted by accelerating gross booking growth in the near term any such acceleration would positively impact revenue growth in subsequent period portion of the revenue recognized from such gross booking will occur in future quarter conversely in period where our gross booking growth rate substantially decelerates our operating margin typically benefit and the date on which certain holiday easter and ramadan fall the covid pandemic impacted the booking window and seasonality of our business in and for example in we saw contraction of the booking window an increased percentage of booking were made for travel that wa to occur close to the time of booking it is difficult to accurately predict travel pattern given the covid pandemic and we may not experience typical seasonality effect on our business throughout the duration of the pandemic and potentially for some time thereafter the travel market recovers from the impact of the covid pandemic we expect to see period of gross booking growth rate acceleration which will likely result in period where our operating margin are negatively impacted due to the timing difference of when marketing expense is recorded and when revenue is recognized for additional information regarding factor affecting the seasonality of our business see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation seasonality and other timing matter human capital resource our employee drive our success and are fundamental to delivering on our mission to make it

remediation plan to address outlier gender diversity of employee of december while significant percentage of our workforce is located in jurisdiction that may present challenge to tracking employee

majority of our workforce to work from home due to the covid pandemic we continue to prioritize and invest in creating opportunity for employee to grow and build their career through training and development program these include offering tailored learning opportunity to enable employee to upskill while at work and driving frequent career conversation between employee and their manager well executive talent and succession planning competition for talent in our industry ha historically been intense however with the proliferation of global working from anywhere policy and the associated increased ability for employee to seek out and switch job that may not have been accessible to them previously the competition for employee particularly software engineer mobile communication talent and other technology professional ha intensified this is further exacerbated by the greater impact of covid on the travel industry versus other industry that employ technology talent that were not directly impacted travel result we have experienced increased cost associated with attracting and retaining our employee we continue to focus on our employee engagement and mental well career satisfaction and development and succession planning we recognize that expectation for the way and place in which employee work have shifted dramatically result of the covid pandemic our brand company have considered hybrid and flexible work from home policy for the longer term we have continued to adhere to our principle of keeping employee safe and engaged we have been flexible with how we form these policy for our various brand we encounter new health related information or emerging expectation in certain market each of our brand ha taken their own tailored approach to working policy that take into account geographic location and the need of current and prospective employee number of our brand have adopted or are exploring more flexible work arrangement including hybrid work from office and home flex program and evaluating long term fully remote arrangement we measure organizational culture and engagement so we can be responsive to our employee need the disruption stemming from the covid pandemic have presented unique challenge to keeping employee engaged and supported at work we shifted our approach to employee engagement in response to changing employee need in mostly virtual workplace by for example providing regular video based ceo update virtual mental wellness workshop and free access to meditation app and telehealth service we regularly connect with our employee through formal engagement survey work from home survey and quick pulse survey to request feedback on the employee experience the result of these effort are shared with senior management at each of our brand analyze area of progress or prioritize area for improvement in order to encourage and sustain employee engagement we are proud that notwithstanding the impact of covid on our

increased debt level and stock price volatility and success of investment and acquisition including integration of acquired business industry and business risksthe covid pandemic ha materially adversely affected and may further adversely impact our business and financial performance in response to the outbreak of the novel strain of the coronavirus covid the covid pandemic well subsequent outbreak driven by new variant of covid government and business around the world have implemented and continue to implement variety of restrictive measure to reduce the spread of covid these measure have had significant adverse effect on many of the partner on which our business relies including hotel and other accommodation provider airline and restaurant well on our consumer operation and workforce in addition the spread of new of covid ha caused uncertainty to when restriction will be lifted if additional restriction may be initiated or reimposed if there will be permanent change to travel behavior pattern and the timing of distribution and administration of covid vaccine and other medical intervention globally in many country experienced spike in covid case due to the spread of variant of covid we believe that vaccine and other medical intervention that prevent or reduce the impact of covid become widespread globally people will increasingly feel it is safe to travel and government restriction will be relaxed although the timing remains uncertain our business is dependent on the availability of large number of accommodation particularly independently owned accommodation and restaurant and on the ability of consumer to travel to such accommodation and restaurant on airline railway and rental car the ability of consumer to travel across international border ha been significantly impacted by the various travel restriction between country we do not expect economic and operating condition for our business to recover fully there is widespread consumer confidence and ability to travel and our travel service provider and restaurant partner are able to meet the demand for service this may not occur until well after the broader global economy begin to improve additionally our business is also dependent on consumer sentiment and discretionary spending pattern any increased unemployment is likely to have negative impact on consumer discretionary spending including for the travel and restaurant industry even though we have seen some improvement in the economic and operating condition for our business since the outset of the covid pandemic we can not predict the long term effect of the pandemic on our business or the travel and restaurant industry whole if the travel and restaurant industry are fundamentally changed by the covid pandemic in way that are detrimental to our operating model our business may continue to be adversely affected even the broader global economy recovers our financial result and prospect are almost entirely dependent on the sale of travel related service the covid pandemic and the resulting economic condition and government restriction resulted in material decrease in consumer spending and significant decline in travel and restaurant activity and consumer demand for related service the covid pandemic ha caused significant change to our accommodation room night trend see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation trend the extent of the effect of the covid pandemic on our business result of operation cash flow and growth prospect is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future development these include but are not limited to the severity extent and duration of the global pandemic including result of any new variant of covid and any resurgence of the pandemic availability and efficacy of vaccine and other medical intervention to prevent or alleviate covid and their impact on the travel and restaurant industry and consumer spending more broadly action taken by national state and local government to contain the disease or treat it impact the impact on attrition well the change in hiring level and remote working arrangement that we have implemented on our operation including the health and productivity of management and our employee and our ability to maintain our financial reporting process and related control the impact on our contract and relationship with our partner our ability to withstand increased cyberattacks the speed and extent of the recovery across the broader travel ecosystem and the duration timing and severity of the impact on customer spending including how long it take to recover from the economic recession resulting from the pandemic the effect of the pandemic may continue to fluctuate throughout the world which could continue to affect our business also restriction in affected region could be extended after the virus ha been contained in order to avoid relapse and there may be restriction on certain travel activity related to whether traveler have been vaccinated if the covid pandemic continues to adversely affect our business and financial performance it may also heighten many of the other risk identified in this section we rely on the performance of highly skilled employee and if we are unable to retain or motivate key employee or hire retain and motivate well qualified employee our business would be harmed our performance is largely dependent on the talent and effort of highly skilled individual including key senior management in the united state europe and asia we may not be able to retain the service of member of our senior management or other key employee the loss of could harm our business and competitive position we had approximately employee worldwide at december our future success and ability to innovate and develop product service technology and enhancement depends on our continuing to identify attract hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled employee across our organization and change in our workforce may make that more difficult in addition our customer service resource and outsource arrangement for customer support may be unable to provide adequate customer service support particularly during peak period result of the ongoing effect of the covid pandemic and the potential for long recovery period for the travel industry it is possible our employee may not view employment with positively they prior to the pandemic the covid pandemic ha had and will have long term effect on how and from where people work the attractiveness of our office environment and remote working policy and there may continue to be operational and workplace cultural challenge that may adversely affect our business including talent retention in the term we are unable to predict if there will be any significant and continuing impact on our workforce result of the covid pandemic competition for well qualified employee in all aspect of our business especially software engineer mobile communication talent product professional and other technology professional is intense and costly in particular our success in market across europe the united state and asia ha led to increased effort by our competitor and others to hire our employee these difficulty may be amplified by increased ability to work remotely evolving restriction on immigration and travel or availability of visa or work permit for skilled technology worker the competition for talent in our industry ha intensified including among established technology company and startup and our personnel expense to attract and retain key talent are increasing there is also competition for technology talent from company with whom we did not historically compete for talent that are transitioning to digital the competition for talent is exacerbated by an increased willingness of certain company to offer flexible and remote working policy which expands the pool of candidate from which our competitor may attract talent this could continue in the future due to an actual or perceived slower pace of recovery of the travel industry result of the covid pandemic than other industry and other factor beyond our control if we do not succeed in attracting and retaining well qualified employee our business our ability to grow and innovate competitive position reputation and result of operation would be adversely affected decline or disruption in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance our financial result and prospect are almost entirely dependent upon the sale of travel service travel including accommodation rental car and airline ticket reservation is significantly dependent on discretionary spending level sale of travel service decline during general economic downturn and recession and time of political or economic uncertainty consumer engage in le discretionary spending are concerned about unemployment or inflation have reduced access to credit or experience other concern or effect that reduce their ability or willingness to travel perceived or actual adverse economic condition including slow slowing or negative economic growth high or rising unemployment rate inflation and weakening currency and concern over government response such higher tax or tariff increased interest rate and reduced government spending have impaired and could in the future adversely affect travel demand political uncertainty can also negatively affect consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand in the past we experienced volatility in transaction growth rate increased cancellation rate and weaker trend in accommodation average daily rate adrs particularly in country most affected by economic and political uncertainty which we believed were due at least in part to these macro economic condition and concern further economic or political disruption could cause contribute to or be indicative of deteriorating macro economic condition which in turn could negatively affect travel and have an adverse impact on our result of operation while lower occupancy rate have historically resulted in accommodation provider increasing their distribution of accommodation reservation through third party intermediary such our remuneration for accommodation reservation transaction change proportionately with price and lower adrs generally have negative effect on our accommodation reservation business and on our revenue and result of operation for discussion of the impact of covid on occupancy rate and adrs see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation trend these and other macro economic uncertainty have led to significant volatility in the exchange rate between the dollar and the euro the british pound sterling and other currency significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate stock market and oil price can also impact consumer travel behavior for example although lower oil price may lead to increased travel activity consumer could have more discretionary fund and airline fare decrease decline in oil price may be indicative of broader macro economic weakness which in turn could negatively affect the travel industry our business and result of operation conversely higher oil price may result in higher airfare and decreased travel activity which can negatively affect our business and result of operation the uncertainty of macro economic factor and their impact on consumer behavior which may differ across region make it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trend and the timing and degree of their impact on our market and business which in turn could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business and adversely affect our result of operation in addition to the impact of the covid pandemic other event beyond our control such terrorist attack extreme weather or natural disaster war and regional hostility travel related accident or increased focus on the environmental impact of travel may disrupt travel limit the ability or willingness of traveler to visit certain location or otherwise result in decline in travel demand and adversely affect our business and result of operation because these event and their impact are largely unpredictable they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumer demand our service and relationship with travel service provider and other partner any of which can adversely affect our business and result of operation intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance we compete globally with both online and traditional travel and restaurant reservation and related service the market for the service we offer are intensely competitive constantly evolving and subject to rapid change and current and new competitor can launch new service at relatively low cost some of our current and potential competitor such google apple alibaba tencent amazon and facebook have significantly more customer or user consumer data and financial and other resource than we do and may be able to leverage other aspect of their business search or mobile device business to compete more effectively with for example google ha entered the online travel market and grown rapidly by linking travel search service to it dominant search functionality through flight hotel and alternative accommodation meta search product google flight google hotel ad and google vacation rental it book on google reservation functionality google travel planning tool that aggregate it flight hotel and package product and integrating it hotel meta search product and restaurant information and reservation product into google map in particular google hotel ad and google flight have grown rapidly and achieved significant market share in relatively short time the economy and the travel industry recover from the impact of the covid pandemic the structure of the travel industry or consumer preference could change in way that could disadvantage and benefit certain of our existing competitor or new entrant for example result of the covid pandemic and the resulting international travel restriction and social distancing practice we saw shift in favor of domestic travel and alternative accommodation this shift could benefit competitor that are more well established in domestic market and alternative accommodation than we are result our historical strength may not provide the competitive advantage that they did prior to the pandemic if we are unable to successfully adapt to any change in how the travel industry operates or to change in the way in which consumer purchase travel service our ability to compete and therefore our business and result of operation would be adversely affected we currently or may in the future compete with company that provide variety of product and service including online travel reservation service online accommodation search and or reservation service that are focused primarily on alternative accommodation large online company including search social networking and marketplace company traditional travel agency travel management company wholesaler and tour operator many of which combine physical location telephone service and online service travel service provider accommodation rental car company or airline that have their own branded online platform to which they drive business online travel meta search and price comparison service super apps that offer consumer wide range of everyday and other service including travel booking company offering new rental car business model or car or ride sharing service that affect demand for rental car some of which have developed innovative technology to improve efficiency of point to point transportation and extensively utilize mobile platform online restaurant reservation service and company offering technology service and software solution to travel service provider including large global distribution system gd and hospitality software platform meta search service leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search result for the consumer specific itinerary across travel service provider online travel company otcs and other online platform and in many instance compete directly with for customer google leverage it general search business to promote it meta search offering by showing meta search result at the top of it organic search result google and other meta search service may evolve into more traditional otcs by offering consumer the ability to make travel reservation directly through their platform if consumer book travel service through service such tripadvisor instant booking google book on google or directly with travel service provider without using an otc like or if meta search service limit our participation within search result or evolve into more traditional otcs we may need to increase our marketing or other customer acquisition cost to maintain or grow our reservation booking and our business and result of operation could be adversely affected the market for travel service ha evolved there ha also been proliferation of new channel through which accommodation provider can offer reservation company such airbnb and expedia group primarily through vrbo offer service providing alternative accommodation property owner an online place to list their accommodation where traveler can search and book such property and compete directly with our alternative accommodation service meta search service may lower the cost for new company to enter the market by providing distribution channel without the cost of promoting the new entrant brand to drive consumer directly to it platform some of our competitor and potential competitor offer variety of online service such food delivery shopping gaming or search service many of which are used by consumer more frequently than online travel service and new travel related service are frequently being introduced to the market competitor or potential competitor that ha established other more frequent online interaction with consumer may be able to more easily or cost effectively acquire customer for it online travel service than we can some competitor or potential competitor with more frequent online interaction with consumer have created or are seeking to create super apps where consumer can use many online service without leaving that company app in particular in asia where online activity including commerce is conducted primarily through apps on mobile device some competitor and new entrant to the travel service industry include private equity funded entity which can more easily withstand significant loss for an extended period of time while such new entrant build market share through heavy marketing and or discounting of their service if any of these competitor are successful in offering new travel related service or service similar to ours to consumer who would otherwise use our platform or if we are unable to offer our service to consumer within these super apps our customer acquisition effort could be le effective and our customer acquisition cost including our marketing expense could increase either of which would harm our business and result of operation although we believe that providing an extensive collection of property excellent customer service and an intuitive easy to use consumer experience are important factor influencing consumer decision to make reservation for many consumer the price of the travel service is the primary factor determining whether to book reservation it is increasingly important to offer travel service such accommodation reservation at competitive price whether through discount coupon closed user group rate or loyalty program increased flexibility in cancellation policy or otherwise discounting and couponing coupled with high degree of consumer shopping behavior is particularly common in asian market in some case our competitor are willing to make little or no profit on transaction or offer travel service at loss in order to gain market share result in certain market we may need to provide discount or other incentive in order to be competitive which may make it difficult for to maintain or grow market share maintain historical profit margin and may also result in lower adrs and lower revenue percentage of gross booking if we are unable to effectively offer competitive price our market share business and result of operation could be materially adversely affected travel service provider with which we conduct business compete with in online channel to drive consumer to their own platform in lieu of third party distributor such travel service provider such large hotel chain may charge lower price and offer advantage such loyalty point or special discount to member of closed user group such loyalty program participant or consumer with registered account any of which could make their offering more attractive to consumer than our service we also offer various incentive to consumer and may need to offer additional or increased incentive to maintain or grow our reservation booking which could adversely impact our profit margin further consolidation among travel service provider could result in lower rate of commission paid to otcs increased discounting and greater incentive for consumer to join closed user group such travel service provider expand their offering if we are not effective our competitor in offering discounted price and other incentive to consumer our ability to grow and compete and our result of operation could be harmed we face risk related to the growth rate and the global expansion of our business we derive substantial portion of our revenue and have significant operation outside the united state our business outside the united state include our netherlands based otc brand booking com including rentalcars com based in the united kingdom our asia based otc brand agoda and to lesser extent the part of the kayak and opentable business located outside the united state the covid pandemic our otc operation outside of the united state historically had achieved significant year over year growth in their gross booking in particular with respect to their accommodation reservation service without taking into consideration the recent decline caused by the covid pandemic these growth rate which contributed significantly to our historical growth in consolidated revenue and earnings had generally declined over time the absolute level of our gross booking increased and online travel growth rate declined in addition to the general slowing growth rate of online travel and the effect of the covid pandemic other factor may also slow the growth rate of our business outside of the united state including worldwide or regional economic condition strengthening of the dollar versus the euro the british pound sterling and other currency decline in adrs increase in adverse change in travel market condition and the competitiveness of the market any decline in the growth rate of our business outside of negatively impact our revenue and earnings growth rate and consequence our stock price our long term strategy involves continued expansion throughout the world and we are subject to associated risk typical of international business international market may have strong local competitor with an established brand and travel service provider or restaurant relationship that may make expansion in that market difficult or costly and take more time than anticipated certain market in which we operate have unique localized preference and lower operating margin compared to other market these market often have competitor willing to make little or no profit through discounting in order to gain market share in addition the emergence of super apps in many of these market may make it even more difficult or costly to compete in these market than in our other market scaling and growing our business in these market in particular in asia could require significant investment which could have negative impact on our profit margin in addition compliance with legal regulatory or tax requirement in multiple jurisdiction place demand on our time and resource and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse legal regulatory or tax consequence in some market such china legal and other regulatory requirement may prohibit or limit participation by foreign business such by making foreign ownership or management of internet or travel related business illegal or difficult or may make direct participation in those market uneconomical which could make our entry into and expansion in those market difficult or impossible require that we work with local partner or result in higher operating cost if we are unsuccessful in expanding in new and existing market and effectively managing that expansion our business and result of operation could be adversely affected we intend to continue to improve the accommodation choice available for reservation on our platform however the growth rate of the number of accommodation on our platform may vary in part result of removing accommodation from our platform from time to time we have generally seen decrease in the number of accommodation on our platform during and resulting from the impact of the covid pandemic and we may see further reduction in the number of accommodation in the future primarily due to property not providing availability on our platform property closure or non payment of invoice many of the newer accommodation we add to our travel reservation service especially in highly penetrated market may have fewer room or higher credit risk and may appeal to smaller subset of consumer hostel and bed and breakfast we believe that the number variety and quality of accommodation on our platform and the corresponding access to accommodation room night had been key driver of the growth of our accommodation reservation business prior to the covid pandemic accommodation provider recover from the covid pandemic they may wish to limit the amount of business that flow through single distribution channel also certain jurisdiction are considering regulation intended to address the issue of overtourism including by restricting accommodation offering in city center or near popular tourist destination such by restricting construction of new hotel or the renting of home or apartment such restriction could also include limiting the number of tourist permitted to visit and stay near popular area during peak season or general matter result we may experience constraint on the number of listing or accommodation room night actually available to which could negatively impact our business growth rate and result of operation historically our brand operated on largely independent basis and many of them focused on particular service or geography we look to develop the connected trip and pursue our other strategic objective we are increasing the collaboration cooperation and interdependence among our brand we manage this shift in addition to managing any change in our workforce we may find it difficult to maintain the beneficial aspect of our corporate culture at the brand company and throughout the organization whole in addition travel recovers from the covid pandemic any future expansion or shift increase the complexity of our business and place additional strain on our management operation technical performance financial resource and administrative legal tax internal control and financial reporting function our current and planned employee and outsourced resource system procedure and control may not be adequate to support and effectively manage growth and increased complexity or could result in actual or perceived disruption of our service or customer support especially we have employee and outsourced resource in multiple geographic location around the world and increase the number and variety of our product and payment system we face risk related to the growth of our alternative accommodation business our alternative accommodation business continues to grow we face new risk relating to characteristic of this business that impact our profit and other metric we may also face new claim of liability and are subject to regulatory development that affect our business because alternative accommodation are often either single unit or small collection of independent unit these property generally represent more limited booking opportunity than hotel motel and resort which generally have more unit to rent per property further alternative accommodation in general may be subject to increased seasonality or may not be available at peak time due to use by the property owner lower profit margin are associated with alternative accommodation property due to certain additional cost related to offering these accommodation on our platform we increase our alternative accommodation business these different characteristic negatively impact our margin and to the extent these property represent an increasing percentage of the property we add to our platform we expect that our room night growth rate and property growth rate will continue to diverge over time since each such alternative accommodation property ha fewer booking opportunity result the percentage of alternative accommodation property increase the number of reservation per property will likely continue to decrease in addition our alternative accommodation reservation business grows we may experience claim of liability based on event occurring at property listed on our platform such robbery injury death or other criminal activity we have no control over the action or ability to predict the action of our consumer property owner and other third party during the customer stay and result we can not guarantee the safety of our consumer property owner and third party in addition we have not in the past and may not in the future undertake to independently verify the safety suitability location quality and legal compliance such fire code compliance or the presence of carbon monoxide detector of all our alternative accommodation listing we have in the past relied and may in the future rely on property owner to disclose information relating to their listing and such information may be inaccurate or incomplete any resulting complaint or claim could result in negative publicity and increased cost which could adversely affect our reputation business and result of operation further the regulatory environment related to the alternative accommodation business is evolving and law regulation or property association rule could impose restriction or burden on these property owner and manager that limit or negatively affect their ability to rent their property some jurisdiction have adopted or are considering statute or ordinance that prohibit owner and manager from renting certain property for fewer than stated number of consecutive day or for more than an aggregate total number of day per year or that require owner or manager to obtain license to rent their property from time to time we are subject to inquiry related to compliance with alternative accommodation law rule and regulation that we may not be able to respond to in timely manner or in full satisfaction of such request the outcome of such inquiry ha resulted in fine and could result in additional fine adversely affect our reputation or require modification to our business operation which could result in increased legal and compliance cost in addition several jurisdiction have adopted or are considering adopting statute or ordinance requiring online platform that list certain alternative accommodation to obtain license to list such accommodation and or to comply with other restriction or requirement law and regulation applicable to alternative accommodation are evolving and can be distinct and inconsistent among the various municipality region and country in which we operate result tracking and compliance with these law and regulation can be difficult and costly government adopt new law rule and regulation related to alternative accommodation we are unable to predict what if any effect any future law and regulation will have on our business this dynamic regulatory environment requires to expend significant time and resource and could negatively impact the growth and or size of our alternative accommodation reservation business we rely on marketing channel to generate significant amount of traffic to our platform and grow our business maintaining and strengthening our brand are important aspect of our effort to attract and retain customer we have invested considerable resource in the establishment and maintenance of our brand and we intend to continue to invest resource in marketing and other brand building effort to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brand when and to the extent we deem appropriate our marketing spend is influenced by the marketing spend of our competitor we seek to maintain and increase our brand recognition and to maintain and grow traffic to our platform through performance marketing channel we may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness and acceptance of our brand and even if we are successful in our branding effort such effort may not be cost effective if we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness and acceptance of our brand in cost effective manner our business market share and result of operation would be materially adversely affected our marketing efficiency expressed marketing expense percentage of revenue is impacted by number of factor that are subject to variability and are in some case outside of our control including adrs cost per click cancellation rate foreign currency exchange rate our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customer and the extent to which consumer come directly to our website or mobile apps for booking for example competition for desired ranking in search result and or decline in ad click by consumer could increase our cost per click and impede our marketing efficiency we use third party website including online search engine primarily google meta search and travel research service and affiliate marketing the primary mean of generating traffic to our website growth of some of these channel had slowed prior to the covid pandemic we can not predict how our marketing efficiency will trend during the recovery from the covid pandemic further at time we may pursue strategy of increasing marketing return on investment roi which could negatively affect our gross booking and revenue growth rate when evaluating our performance marketing spend generally we consider several factor for each channel such the customer experience on the advertising platform the incrementality of the traffic we receive the anticipated repeat rate from particular platform and the likelihood of cancellation pursuing strategy of improving marketing roi along with factor such competitor action in the bidding environment the amount of marketing invested by these channel to generate demand and overall marketing platform traffic growth trend have shown volatility and long term deceleration of growth rate may also impact growth rate for marketing channel any deterioration in our marketing efficiency could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation whether through reduced revenue or revenue growth or through marketing expense increasing faster than revenue which would reduce margin and earnings growth many factor could cause consumer to increase their shopping activity before making travel purchase increased shopping activity impedes our marketing efficiency and effectiveness because traffic becomes le likely to result in reservation through our platform and such traffic is more likely to be obtained through paid marketing channel than through direct channel further consumer may favor travel service offered by search or meta search company over otcs which could reduce traffic to our travel reservation platform increase consumer awareness of our competitor brand and platform increase our marketing and other customer acquisition cost and adversely affect our business margin and result of operation to the extent any such increased shopping behavior lead to growth in our kayak meta search business such growth may not result in sufficient increase in revenue from our kayak meta search business to offset any related decrease in revenue or increase in marketing and other customer acquisition cost experienced by our otc brand we may not be able to keep up with rapid technological or other market change the market in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standard consolidation frequent new service announcement introduction and enhancement and changing consumer demand and preference these characteristic are changing at an even greater pace otcs and travel service provider seek to address consumer need and preference resulting from the covid pandemic we may not be able to keep up with these rapid change in addition these market characteristic are heightened by the progress of technology adoption in various market including the continuing adoption of the internet and online commerce in certain geography and the growth of the use of smartphones tablet and other smart device for mobile commerce transaction new development in other area such cloud computing could make entering our market easier for competitor due to lower upfront technology cost it is increasingly important for to effectively offer our service on mobile device through mobile apps and mobile optimized website and to tailor our service to varying device and platform see below part item risk factor consumer adoption and use of mobile device creates challenge and may enable device company such google and apple to compete directly with our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technology to adapt our service and online platform to evolving industry standard and local preference and to continually innovate and improve the performance feature and reliability of our service and online platform in response to competitive service offering and the evolving demand of the marketplace additionally our ability to achieve our long term strategy to build the connected trip depends on successfully integrating and developing new and evolving technology which will require increased financial and personnel investment that could have an adverse impact on our result of operation until we achieve the expected return on these investment while we believe that we have the ability to achieve our long term strategy to build the connected trip the development of the connected trip is subject to uncertainty including further technical development of the flight accommodation and other vertical necessary for the connected trip experience the ability to collect store and use customer data in compliant and integrated fashion and the attraction and retention of employee dedicated to this development effort result it may take longer than we expect to build the connected trip or it may not achieve the expected return on investment consumer demand for the connected trip may also not be sustained at the level that we anticipate these effort may also not be successful in improving the travel experience or retaining and attracting new customer further regulatory authority may subject to existing or new rule or restriction that could prevent from successfully commercializing the connected trip or expose to unanticipated claim or liability with any technical innovation such the connected trip effort there could be bug vulnerability and other system failure which could result in lost business harm to our brand or reputation consumer complaint and other adverse consequence any of which could adversely affect our business and result of operation we are working toward enhancing our payment capability including by offering alternative payment solution to consumer even when those payment solution may not be accepted by the travel service provider or restaurant alternate payment provider such alipay paytm and wechat pay operate closed loop payment system with direct connection to both consumer and merchant in many market particularly in asia where credit card are not readily available and or commerce is largely carried out through mobile device these and other emerging alternative payment method are the exclusive or preferred mean of payment for many consumer if we are unable to offer consumer their preferred method of payment by integrating new or emerging payment method into our platform we may not be able to effectively offer our service to these consumer which would limit our growth opportunity in these market and our business and result of operation could be harmed in the future the competitive pressure to innovate could encompass wider range of service and technology including service and technology that may be outside of our historical core business and our ability to keep pace may slow our current and potential competitor range from large and established company to emerging start ups emerging start ups may be able to innovate and focus on developing particularly new product or service faster than we can or may foresee consumer need for new service or technology before we do some of our competitor have more resource or more established or varied relationship with consumer than we have and they could use these advantage in way that could affect our competitive position including by making acquisition entering or investing in travel reservation business investing in research and development and competing aggressively for highly skilled employee in addition the widespread adoption of new internet networking or telecommunication technology such smart home device artificial intelligence chatbot virtual reality technology and the creation of super apps could require to incur substantial expenditure to modify or adapt our service or infrastructure to these new technology which could adversely affect our result of operation or financial condition we are in the early stage of multi year phased migration to integrate and upgrade certain cross brand global financial system and process the implementation of new information technology payment enterprise resource planning erp or other system could be disruptive and or costly or we may experience difficulty successfully integrating new system into existing system or migrating to new system from existing system any of which could adversely affect our business and result of operation any failure to implement or adapt to new technology in timely manner or at all could adversely affect our ability to compete increase our consumer acquisition cost or otherwise adversely affect our business brand market share and result of operation our business could be negatively affected by change in online search and meta search algorithm and dynamic or traffic generating arrangement we use google to generate significant portion of traffic to our platform and to lesser extent we use other search and meta search service to generate traffic to our platform principally through pay per click marketing campaign the pricing and operating dynamic on these search and meta search platform can experience rapid change commercially technically and competitively for example google frequently update and change the logic which determines the placement and display of result of consumer search such that the placement of link to our platform can be negatively affected and our cost to improve or maintain our placement in search result can increase the european commission ha fined google significant amount for anti competitive behavior relating to it comparison shopping service and online search advertising service change by google in how it present travel search result including promotion of it own travel meta search service amount charged to travel partner for referral or the manner in which it conduct the auction for placement among search result may be competitively disadvantageous to may increase our cost and may impact our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our platform which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business market share and result of operation google recently modified it hotel price comparison search tool to display price for accommodation and booking provider for free following similar change it made to google flight in addition decline or slowing growth in travel search traffic negatively impact our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our platform through performance marketing on general search platform which could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation we purchase online traffic from number of other source including some operated by our competitor in the form of pay per click arrangement that can be terminated with little or no notice if one or more of such arrangement is terminated our business market share and result of operation could be adversely affected we rely on various third party distribution channel marketing affiliate to distribute accommodation rental car and airline ticket reservation should one or more of such third party cease distribution of reservation made through or suffer deterioration in it search or meta search ranking due to change in search or meta search algorithm or otherwise our business market share and result of operation could be adversely affected consumer adoption and use of mobile device creates challenge and may enable device company such google and apple to compete directly with widespread adoption of mobile device such the iphone and android enabled smartphones coupled with the web browsing functionality and development of thousand of apps available on these device continues to drive substantial online traffic and commerce to mobile platform we have experienced significant shift of business both direct and indirect to mobile platform and our advertising partner are also seeing rapid shift of traffic to mobile platform the revenue earned on mobile transaction may be le than typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing pattern for example accommodation reservation made on mobile device typically are for shorter length of stay have lower adrs and are not made far in advance to the extent mobile device or platform enable user to block advertising content our advertising revenue and our ability to market our brand and acquire new consumer may also be negatively affected given the device size and technical limitation of smartphones mobile consumer may not be willing to download multiple apps from company providing similar service and instead prefer to use one or limited number of apps for their mobile travel and restaurant research and reservation activity result the consumer experience with mobile apps well brand recognition and loyalty continue to be increasingly important our mobile offering have received generally strong review and are driving material and increasing share of our business we believe that mobile booking are necessary to maintain and grow our business consumer increasingly turn to mobile device instead of personal computer result it is increasingly important for to develop and maintain effective mobile platform to provide consumer with an appealing easy to use mobile experience and that the feature of our mobile platform are competitive with our peer if we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new user friendly and differentiated mobile offering and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platform or if our mobile offering are not used by consumer we could lose market share and our business future growth and result of operation could be adversely affected google android operating system is the leading smartphone operating system in the world result google ha the ability to leverage it android operating system to give it travel service competitive advantage either technically or with prominence on it google play app store or within it mobile search result further google is the leading internet search service and ha leveraged it search popularity to promote it travel service although google ha faced legal challenge in europe and the united state under various anticompetition law including in respect of giving it own service and product preferential treatment in the online search market it is not yet clear how or whether these action will further affect google business including it travel service apple ha substantial market share in the smartphone market and control integration of offering including travel service into it mobile operating system apple also ha more experience producing and developing mobile apps and ha access to greater resource than we have apple may use or expand it existing and potential mobile apps such wallet siri apple voice recognition concierge service apple pay apple mobile payment system or another mobile app or functionality mean of entering the online travel reservation marketplace to the extent google or apple use their mobile operating system app distribution channel or in the case of google search service to favor their own travel service offering our business and result of operation could be harmed impairment of goodwill long term investment and long lived asset increase in provision for expected credit loss on receivables from and cash advance made to our travel service provider and restaurant partner and increase in cash outlay to refund consumer for prepaid reservation have negative impact on our result of operation result of the deterioration of our business due to the covid pandemic during we recorded goodwill impairment charge in our kayak and opentable reporting unit and in our investment in didi global inc didi future event and changing market condition may lead to evaluate the assumption used to estimate the fair value of opentable and kayak particularly the assumption related to the length and severity of the covid pandemic the shape and timing of the subsequent recovery and the performance of the business during and following the covid pandemic which may result in need to recognize an additional goodwill impairment charge which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation see note and to the consolidated financial statement for additional information related to the impairment charge in addition in given the severe downturn in the global travel industry and the financial difficulty faced by many of our travel service provider and restaurant partner and marketing affiliate we increased our provision for expected credit loss on receivables from and prepayment to our travel service provider and restaurant partner and marketing affiliate see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information due to the high level of cancellation of existing reservation we incurred higher than normal cash outlay to refund consumer for prepaid reservation in some instance we did not estimate recovery of prepayment already made to travel service provider where we had agreed to provide free cancellation to consumer for non refundable reservation any significant increase in our provision for expected credit loss and any significant increase in cash outlay to refund consumer would have corresponding adverse effect on our result of operation and related cash flow in certain instance we may offer cancellable room rate on behalf of partner to provide flexibility to our consumer even if the partner ha not provided cancellable room rate which could have negative impact on our revenue if we are unable to facilitate booking from another customer we are dependent on provider of accommodation rental car and airline ticket and on restaurant we rely on provider of accommodation rental car and airline ticket and on restaurant to make their service available to consumer through our arrangement with travel service provider generally do not require them to make available any specific quantity of accommodation reservation rental car or airline ticket or to make accommodation reservation rental car or airline ticket available in any geographic area for any particular route or at any particular price similarly our arrangement with restaurant generally do not require them to provide all of their available table and to customer through we are in regular dialogue with our major travel service provider about the nature and extent of their participation in our service significant reduction on the part of any of our major travel service provider or provider that are particularly popular with consumer for sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal could have material adverse effect on our business market share and result of operation to the extent any of those major or popular travel service provider ceased to participate in our service in favor of one of our competitor service or decided to require consumer to purchase service directly from them our business market share and result of operation could be harmed during period of higher occupancy rate accommodation provider may decrease their distribution of accommodation reservation through third party intermediary like in particular through our discount service further consolidation among travel service provider increase the potential adverse effect of decision by any particular significant travel service provider such large hotel chain airline or rental car company to withdraw from or reduce it participation in our service also increase the covid pandemic ha increased the risk that our travel service provider and restaurant partner voluntarily or involuntarily declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease or limit their operation which could harm our business and result of operation in particular the potential harm to our business and result of operation is greater if there are bankruptcy or closure of larger partner such airline hotel chain or large rental car company to the extent restaurant limit the availability of reservation through opentable or if significant number of restaurant cease to participate in our service or if government restriction limit occupant capacity of any travel service provider or restaurant result of the covid pandemic consumer may not continue to use our service and or our revenue and result of operation could be adversely affected kayak meta search service depends on access to information related to travel service pricing schedule availability and other related information from otcs and travel service provider to attract consumer many of kayak agreement with otcs and travel service provider are short term agreement that may be terminated on day notice to the extent otcs or travel service provider no longer provide such information to kayak kayak ability to provide comprehensive travel service information to consumer could be diminished and it brand business and result of operation could be harmed to the extent consumer do not view kayak reliable source of comprehensive travel service information fewer consumer would likely visit it website which would also likely have negative impact on kayak advertising revenue and result of operation in addition if otcs or travel service provider choose not to advertise with kayak or choose to reduce or eliminate the fee paid to kayak for referral from query result kayak business and result of operation could be adversely affected investment in new business strategy and acquisition could disrupt our ongoing business and present risk not originally contemplated we have invested and in the future may invest in new business strategy and acquisition of complementary business in furtherance of our mission to make it easier for everyone to experience the world for example we acquired getaroom in december to enhance our business to business distribution capability for hotel partner and more effectively support our accommodation affiliate partner and in november we entered into an agreement to acquire european based flight booking provider etraveli group such endeavor may involve significant risk and uncertainty including diversion of management attention from current operation greater than expected liability and expense inadequate return on capital new risk with which we are not familiar legal compliance obligation that previously did not apply to integration risk and difficulty and unidentified issue not discovered in our investigation and evaluation of those strategy and acquisition result entering new business involves risk and cost that could if realized have an adverse effect on our business reputation result of operation profit margin cash flow or financial condition well on our ability to achieve the expected benefit of any such investment or acquisition we may decide to make minority investment including through joint venture in which we have limited or no management or operational control the controlling person in such case may have business interest strategy or goal that are inconsistent with ours and decision of the company or venture in which we invested may result in harm to our reputation or business or adversely affect the value of our investment we acquired substantial portion of our goodwill and intangible asset in acquisition if we determine that any of our goodwill and intangible asset or any goodwill or intangible asset acquired in future transaction experience decline in value we may be required to record an impairment which could materially adversely affect our result of operation further we may issue share of our common stock in these transaction which could result in dilution to our stockholder we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired business or combine internal business the integration of acquired business requires significant time and resource and we may not manage these process successfully in addition to acquired business we have integrated certain of our business that had been managed integrated certain function across our business and restructured or ceased operating certain asset or business and we may do so in the future including through divestiture integration are complex often involve additional or unexpected cost and create variety of issue and risk including disruption or harm to the business involved disruption to our other business including result of the need for management to spend time and attention on the integration difficulty combining different company culture system reporting structure title job description and compensation scheme problem retaining key personnel in particular at the acquired or integrated company loss of travel service provider restaurant or partner of the acquired business and difficulty implementing and maintaining effective control procedure and policy we may not successfully integrate company or achieve the strategic financial or operating objective of the acquisition or integration any of which could adversely affect our business result of operation or value of our acquisition information security cybersecurity and data privacy risksour processing storage use and disclosure of personal data expose to risk of internal or external security breach and could give rise to liability and or damage our reputation we are an innovative technology company dependent on sophisticated software application and computing infrastructure if cyber criminal or other threat actor are able to circumvent our security control and capability including result of our own act or omission it could result in compromise or breach of consumer data in commerce data security is essential to maintaining consumer and partner confidence in our service consumer who use certain of our service provide with their personal identity data and payment information which in turn attracts attention from threat actor and fraudsters cyberattacks by various threat actor including cyber criminal hacker and state sponsored organization are increasing in frequency and sophistication and are constantly evolving we face sophisticated highly resourceful and determined adversary and may not be able to defend against persistent sophisticated cyberattack from such an adversary in addition our security policy and internal security control may not keep pace with the continuous innovation of our offering vulnerability in our consumer and partner account security and workflow practice may result in unauthorized access to confidential data these risk are likely to increase we expand our offering integrate our product and service and store and process more data including personal information and payment data our effort to protect information from unauthorized access may result in the rejection of legitimate attempt to book reservation through our service which could result in lost business we expend significant resource to protect against security breach and regularly increase our security related expenditure to maintain or increase our system security we have experienced and responded to cyberattacks which we believe have not had significant impact on the integrity of our system or the security of data including personal information maintained by security breach could result in negative publicity damage our reputation expose to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability subject to regulatory penalty and sanction or cause consumer to lose confidence in our security and choose to use the service of our competitor any of which would have an adverse effect on our brand market share result of operation and financial condition see risk relating to cyberattacks in the risk below in part item risk factor cyberattacks and system vulnerability could lead to service outage data loss reduced revenue increased cost liability claim or harm to our competitive position additionally our consumer personal data could be affected by security breach at third party upon which we rely such travel service provider connectivity partner payroll provider health plan provider payment processor data exchange service for example xml provider or gd see below part item risk factor our business relies on global supply chain of third party service provider and we are exposed to risk because we rely on the resilience security and legal compliance of their product and service in the operation of our business we receive and store large volume of personally identifiable data and payment information this data is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation in numerous jurisdiction around the world the european union general data protection regulation the gdpr imposes significant compliance obligation and cost on under the gdpr violation could result in fine of up to million euro or up to of the annual global revenue of the infringer whichever is greater several data protection authority have imposed significant fine on company of various size industry sector for violation of the gdpr the california consumer privacy act the ccpa which became operative in january and the california privacy right act which is set to become operative in january each impose new privacy requirement and right for consumer in california and ha resulted and will continue to result in additional complexity and cost related to compliance many other jurisdiction have adopted or may adopt similar data protection regulation these regulation are typically intended to protect the security of personal data that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction well to give individual greater right and or control over how their data is processed in many case these law apply not only to third party transaction but also to transfer of information between and our subsidiary including employee information these law and their interpretation continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction for example the invalidation of the eu privacy shield in altered one of the acceptable approach which many company relied upon to ensure compliant data transfer between the european union and the united state additionally some of these regulation such the ccpa give consumer private right of action against company for violation of these rule while we have invested and continue to invest significant resource to comply with the gdpr ccpa and other privacy regulation many of these regulation such the personal information protection law in people republic of china prc are new complex and subject to interpretation non compliance with these law could result in negative publicity damage to our reputation significant penalty or other legal liability if legislation or regulation are expanded to require change in our business practice or if governing jurisdiction interpret or implement their legislation or regulation in way that negatively affect our business our result of operation financial condition or competitive position could be adversely affected cyberattacks and system vulnerability could lead to service outage data loss reduced revenue increased cost liability claim or harm to our competitive position prior to the covid pandemic we experienced rapid growth in consumer traffic to our online platform the number of accommodation on our extranets and the geographic breadth of our operation the travel industry begin to recover if our system can not be expanded to cope with increased demand or fail to perform we could experience unanticipated disruption in service slower response time decreased customer service and customer satisfaction and delay in the introduction of new service any of which could impair our reputation damage our brand and materially and adversely affect our result of operation further an online business we are dependent on the internet and maintaining connectivity between and consumer source of internet traffic such google and our travel service provider and restaurant consumer increasingly turn to mobile and other smart device we also become dependent on consumer access to the internet through mobile carrier and their system disruption in internet access especially if widespread or prolonged could materially adversely affect our business and result of operation while we maintain redundant system and hosting service it is possible that we could experience an interruption in our business and we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate for all loss that may occur we have computer hardware for operating our service located in hosting facility around the world we do not have comprehensive disaster recovery plan in every geographic region in which we conduct business and these system and operation are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error computer virus flood fire power loss telecommunication failure and similar event they are also subject to break in sabotage intentional act of vandalism terrorism and similar misconduct in the event of any disruption of service at such facility or the failure by such facility to provide our required data communication capacity we may not be able to switch to back up system immediately and it could result in lengthy interruption or delay in our service in addition to placing increased burden on our engineering staff these outage could create significant amount of consumer question and complaint that need to be addressed by customer support any system failure that cause an interruption or delay in service could impair our reputation damage our brand increase customer service cost or result in lost business any of which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation we have taken and continue to take step to increase the reliability and redundancy of our system these step are expensive may reduce our margin and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime we have experienced targeted and organized malware phishing and account takeover attack and may in the future experience these and other form of attack such ransomware sql injection where third party attempt to insert malicious code into our software through data entry field in our website in order to gain control of the system and attempt to use our website platform to launch denial of service attack on another party our existing security measure may not be successful in preventing attack on our system for instance from time to time we have experienced denial of service type attack on our system that have made portion of our website slow or unavailable for period of time traditional it business continuity and disaster recovery practice are le effective against certain type of attack such ransomware or malware ransomware attack could result in our service being unavailable for an extended period of time nullify our data or expose our payment card and personal data reduction in the availability and response time of our online service could cause loss of substantial business volume during the occurrence of any such attack on our system and measure we may take to divert traffic in the event of such an attack could result in the diversion of bona fide customer these issue are more difficult to manage during any expansion of the number of place where we operate and the variety of service we offer and the tool and technique used in such attack become more advanced our insurance policy have coverage limit and may not be adequate to reimburse for all loss caused by security breach successful attack could result in significant interruption in our operation severe damage to our information technology infrastructure negative publicity damage our reputation and prevent consumer from using our service during the attack any of which could cause consumer to use the service of our competitor which would have negative effect on the value of our brand our market share business and result of operation we use both internally developed system and third party system to operate our service including transaction processing order management and financial and accounting system if the number of consumer using our service increase substantially or if critical third party system stop operating designed we may need to significantly expand and upgrade our technology transaction processing system financial and accounting system or other infrastructure we may not be able to upgrade our system and infrastructure to accommodate such condition in timely manner and depending on the system affected our transactional financial and accounting system could be impacted for meaningful amount of time before upgrade expansion or repair many of our process and system including those related to processing and recording revenue are highly automated and involve multiple input from various it system which can mitigate the risk of human error but which can also make testing troubleshooting and auditing more difficult result it may be difficult to quickly detect and correct error embedded in these process or system our business relies on global supply chain of third party service provider and we are exposed to risk because we rely on the resilience security and legal compliance of their product and service we rely on certain third party computer system and third party service provider including gd and computerized central reservation system of the accommodation rental car and airline industry in connection with providing some of our service any damage to breach of or interruption in these third party service and system or deterioration in their performance could prevent from booking related accommodation rental car and airline reservation and have material adverse effect on our business brand and result of operation our agreement with some third party service provider are terminable upon short notice and often do not provide recourse for service interruption in the event our arrangement with any such third party is terminated we may not be able to find an alternative source of system support on timely basis or on commercially reasonable term and result it could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation consumer generally are concerned with security and privacy on the internet and any publicized security problem could negatively affect consumer willingness to provide private information or effect online commercial transaction generally including through our service some of our business is conducted with third party marketing affiliate which may generate travel reservation through our infrastructure or through other system security breach at any third party such the security breach experienced by mgm resort international in could be perceived by consumer security breach of our system and could result in negative publicity subject to notification requirement damage our reputation expose to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject to regulatory penalty and sanction even if we had no direct involvement in the breach in addition such third party may not comply with applicable disclosure requirement or with parameter within which we permit them to process data which could expose to liability we depend upon various third party to process payment including credit card for our merchant transaction around the world in addition we rely on third party to provide credit card number which we use payment mechanism for merchant transaction if any such third party were wholly or partially compromised or ceased or suspended operation our cash flow could be disrupted or we may not be able to generate merchant transaction and related revenue for period of time and this could have negative effect on our business reputation and result of operation and in certain case of the insolvency of such partner could result in additional payment by and loss of the total transaction value tax regulatory compliance and reputational riskswe may have exposure to additional tax liability an international business providing reservation and marketing service around the world we are subject to income tax and non income based tax although we believe that our tax filing position are reasonable and comply with applicable law we regularly review our tax filing position especially in light of tax law or business practice change and we may change our position or determine that previous position should be amended either of which could result in additional tax liability the final determination of tax audit or tax dispute may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accrual to date we have been audited in many taxing jurisdiction with no significant impact on our result of operation if current or future audit find that additional tax are due we may be subject to incremental tax liability possibly including interest and penalty which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and cash flow see note to our consolidated financial statement for more information regarding certain tax matter and tax contingency in general government are increasingly focused on way to increase tax revenue which ha contributed to an increase in audit activity more aggressive position taken by tax authority more time and difficulty to resolve any audit or dispute and an increase in new tax legislation any such additional tax or other assessment may be in excess of our current tax provision or may require to modify our business practice in order to reduce our exposure to additional tax going forward any of which could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition

adversely affected the interpretation and implementation of the tax act and regulation rule or guidance that have been or may be adopted under or result from the tax act have had and could have negative impact on our result of operation and cash flow in addition increase in the corporate income tax rate increasing the percentage of gilti subject to tax in the united state or other change included in any adopted federal tax legislation could have negative impact on our result of operation and cash flow certain country have taken step to unilaterally introduce digital service tax to address the issue of multinational business carrying on business in their jurisdiction without physical presence and therefore generally not being subject to income tax in those jurisdiction these digital service tax are calculated percentage of revenue rather than income or profit the interpretation and implementation of the various digital service tax especially if there is inconsistency in the application of these tax across tax jurisdiction could have materially adverse impact on our result of operation and cash flow further digital service tax may not apply to our competitor such hotel chain and smaller otcs which could harm our business and competitive position due to the large scale of our business activity outside of the united state any change in or international taxation of our activity such new definition of permanent establishment new nexus and profit allocation rule or the combined effect of tax law in multiple jurisdiction may increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the complexity and cost associated with tax compliance and adversely affect our cash flow and result of operation additionally there have been significant change made and proposed to

where appropriate intend to continue to assert that we should not be subject to such tax although we believe we do not owe the tax claimed in these lawsuit litigation is uncertain and if there wa an adverse outcome in this litigation or any similar litigation in other jurisdiction it could result in liability for past and or future booking and it could have an adverse effect on our business profit margin and result of operation an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation audit proceeding or other regulatory inquiry

require to collect and remit sale tax on behalf of travel service provider which in some instance may negatively impact our revenue adverse tax decision or new law could have material adverse effect on our business margin cash flow and result of operation we may not be able to maintain our innovation box tax benefit the netherlands corporate income tax law provides that income generated from qualifying innovative activity is taxed at the rate of beginning in january and prior to innovation box tax rather than the dutch statutory rate of effective january the netherlands corporate income tax rate increased from to portion of booking com earnings historically ha qualified for innovation box tax treatment in order to be eligible for innovation box tax treatment booking com must among other thing apply for and obtain research and development certificate from dutch governmental agency every six month confirming that the activity that booking com intends to be engaged in over the subsequent six month period are innovative the certificate is current but should booking com fail to secure such certificate in any future period for example because the governmental agency doe not

thereof whether due to change in tax law or determination by the dutch government that booking com activity are not innovative or for any other reason could substantially increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our result of operation and cash flow in the future our business is subject to various competition anti trust consumer protection and online commerce law rule and regulation around the world and the size of our business grows scrutiny of our business by legislator and regulator in these area may intensify we the travel industry and the technology industry generally are subject to competition and consumer protection law and regulation around the world these law and regulation evolve and change and their interpretation application and enforcement can also change be unpredictable or be affected by changing political or social pressure we expand our business into new area including our evolution towards the connected trip we may become subject to additional law and regulation at time online travel platform including have been the subject of investigation or inquiry by various national competition authority ncas or other governmental authority for example we have been and continue to be involved in investigation related to whether booking com contractual parity arrangement with accommodation provider sometimes also referred to most favored nation or mfn provision are anti competitive because they require accommodation provider to provide booking com with room rate condition and availability that are at least favorable those offered to other otcs or through the accommodation provider website to resolve and close certain of the investigation we have from time to time made commitment to the investigating authority regarding future business practice or activity such agreeing to narrow the scope of our parity arrangement additionally these type of investigation can result and have resulted in the assessment of fine we have also been involved in investigation or inquiry involving consumer protection matter including in the united kingdom and the european union and we have previously made certain voluntary commitment to consumer authority to resolve investigation or inquiry that have included showing price inclusive of all mandatory tax and charge providing information about the effect of money earned on search result ranking on or before the search result page and certain adjustment to how discount and statement concerning popularity or availability are shown to consumer to the extent that these or any other investigation or inquiry result in additional commitment fine damage or other remedy our business financial condition and result of operation could be harmed market evolve and ncas or other governmental authority continue to monitor our industry new investigation of the industry generally or of specifically could and have occurred including revisiting issue that were the subject of prior investigation while we believe that we are complying with our commitment investigating authority or third party may determine that we are not complying with the commitment we have made and decide to pursue legal action to compel compliance or seek other remedy further in september the swiss price surveillance office opened an investigation into the level of commission of booking com in switzerland and the investigation is ongoing if there is an adverse outcome and booking com is unsuccessful in any appeal booking com could be required to reduce it commission in switzerland we are cooperating with regulator where applicable but we are unable to predict what if any effect any investigation or resolution thereof including the effect of any commitment we might make will have on our business industry practice or online commerce more generally to the extent that regulatory authority impose fine on or require change to our business practice or to those currently common to the industry our business competitive position and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected negative publicity regarding competition and or consumer law investigation could adversely affect our brand and therefore our business market share and result of operation competition and consumer law related investigation legislation or issue have and could in the future result in private litigation another area of regulatory inquiry involves contractual search term bidding restriction where one contracting party agrees not to bid on certain key search term related to the other party such other party name although we are generally moving away from these type of agreement in some of our contract we or the other party have agreed to bidding restriction if bidding restriction are held to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable or if we remove them from all of our contract it could negatively impact our performance marketing efficiency business and result of operation there is significant legislative and public focus on the technology industry especially technology company become larger in some instance country have passed legislation that go further to restrict business activity than action taken by ncas or other regulatory authority france italy belgium portugal and austria have passed legislation prohibiting parity contract clause in their entirety and last year german court ruled that our narrow parity clause are not permitted additionally the eu platform to business regulation regulates the relationship between online platform such booking com and european business user of online platform in december the european commission proposed the digital market act and the digital service act which are expected to give regulator more instrument to investigate digital business and impose new rule on certain digital platform if they are determined to be gatekeeper the proposed legislation is not final and it is not entirely known what the law will look like in their final form if regulator were to presume that we are gatekeeper under the digital market act currently proposed and we are not successful in rebutting that presumption we would be subject to additional rule and regulation not applicable to all our competitor and our business could be harmed for example the rule applicable to gatekeeper could impose limitation on data collection and usage across service or with third party well on bundling service and could require gatekeeper to share certain customer information with partner wide and possibly any type of parity clause could be prohibited for gatekeeper platform additionally in july president biden of the united state signed an executive order aimed at restricting anticompetitive practice including those within the technology industry any rule or regulation that result from this executive order well any other new law and regulation and changing public perception relating to the technology industry could impact our service require to change our business practice or otherwise cause to incur additional operating cost to comply with or address these development further market condition change result of investigation litigation legislation or political or social pressure we may decide to voluntarily modify our business practice beyond what is required the full effect of which may not be known when making the decision but which could harm our competitive position and adversely affect our business and result of operation with additional attention on the size of travel or technology company generally our size and market share may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisition our ability to expand into complementary business or our latitude in dealing with travel service provider such by limiting our ability to provide discount rebate or incentive or to exercise contractual right any of which could adversely affect our business result of operation or ability to grow and compete and legal requirement and uncertainty could subject to business constraint increased compliance cost and complexity or otherwise harm our business our ability to provide our service and any future service is and will continue to be affected by legal regulation of national and local government and regulatory authority many of which are evolving and subject to the possibility of new or revised interpretation for example we currently offer optional rental car related insurance product to customer protecting them against accidental damage to their rental vehicle optional room and flight cancellation insurance product and we intend to offer additional trip related insurance product in the future which subject to certain insurance regulation and related increased compliance cost and complexity any of which could negatively impact our business and result of operation law in some country relating to data localization registration travel agent and other local requirement could if applicable to adversely affect our ability to conduct business in those country any increase in the number or complexity of the law and regulation applicable to and our business could increase our compliance cost and burden and negatively affect our business and result of operation for example in the european union and the united kingdom the package travel directive and other local law governing the sale of travel service the package directive set out broad requirement such local registration certain mandatory financial guarantee disclosure requirement and other rule regulating the provision of single travel sale travel package and linked travel arrangement the package directive also creates additional liability for provider of travel package which could be the otc for performance of the travel service within packaged trip under certain circumstance some part of our business are already subject to the broad scope of the package directive and our offering continue to diversify and expand we may become subject to additional requirement of the package directive compliance with this directive could be costly and complex or result of these requirement we could choose to limit offering that would otherwise be beneficial for the business any of which could adversely affect our business result of operation or ability to grow and compete any change to the package directive including any change to the scope of the travel service covered increased level of consumer protection or change to the requirement of financial guarantee could be costly or complex to comply with and may also adversely affect our business result of operation or ability to grow and compete in the future the implementation of unfavorable regulation or unfavorable interpretation of existing regulation by judicial or regulatory body could require to incur significant compliance cost cause the development of the affected market to become impractical and otherwise have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation for example in connection with lawsuit begun in by the association of turkish travel agency turkish court ordered in that booking com must meet certain registration requirement in order to offer turkish hotel and accommodation to turkish resident if booking com doe not successfully appeal this decision or meet the turkish registration requirement booking com will be unable to resume offering turkish hotel and accommodation to turkish resident which would continue to negatively impact our result of operation there can be no assurance that there will not be an adverse outcome to any such litigation or that such an outcome would not result in an adverse impact on our business financial condition or result of operation compliance with the law and regulation of multiple jurisdiction increase our cost of doing business example of these law and regulation which vary and sometimes conflict include the foreign corrupt practice act the bribery act and local law which also prohibit corrupt payment to governmental official or third party data privacy requirement labor relation law non discrimination human right or anti human trafficking law and regulation such the modern slavery act tax law anti trust or competition law or sanctioned country or sanctioned person mandate and consumer protection law violation of these law and regulation could result in fine penalty and or criminal sanction against our officer or our employee and or prohibition on the conduct of our business any such violation could result in prohibition on our ability to offer our service in one or more country could delay or prevent potential acquisition and could materially damage our reputation our brand our global expansion effort our ability to attract and retain employee and business partner our business and our operating result even if we comply with these law and regulation doing business in certain jurisdiction or violation of these law and regulation by the accommodation restaurant travel service provider or other party with whom we conduct business could harm our reputation and brand which could adversely affect our result of operation or stock price in addition these restriction may provide competitive advantage to our competitor unless they are also subject to comparable restriction our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risk and manage these difficulty additionally our employee in certain country in europe are represented by work council and or trade union we are required to consult with work council on certain matter such restructurings acquisition and divestiture and other matter that could impact our labor force consultation may not be completed on term satisfactory to and result could result in increase in our cost of labor diversion of management attention away from operating our business delay in certain initiative and expose to claim and litigation we are also subject to variety of other regulatory legal and public policy risk and challenge in managing an organization operating in various country including those related to regulatory change or other government action additional complexity to comply with regulation in multiple jurisdiction well overlapping or inconsistent legal regime in particular with respect to tax labor consumer protection digital content advertising promotion privacy and competition law difficulty in transferring fund from or converting currency in certain country reduced protection for intellectual property right in some country and change in social or political condition or policy relating to wide range of sustainability topic we have made effort and expect to make further effort to integrate access to travel service across our various brand these change add complexity to legal and tax compliance and our internal control and our size and operating history may increase the likelihood that we will be subject to regulatory scrutiny or audit by tax authority in various jurisdiction in addition by virtue of booking com size and presence in the netherlands it is required to have supervisory board to oversee the strategy and operation of booking com while the existence of the supervisory board ha not had significant impact on our operation under certain circumstance this governance structure could require booking com to obtain supervisory board approval in order to take certain action which could result in delay or other unanticipated strategic or operational challenge there are various risk associated with the facilitation of payment from consumer including risk related to fraud compliance with evolving rule and regulation and reliance on third party our result have been and will likely continue to be negatively impacted by consumer purchase made using fraudulent payment card such credit debit prepaid or similar card claim the consumer did not authorize the purchase or consumer who have closed bank account or have insufficient fund in their bank account to satisfy payment we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent payment card such stolen or cloned card on our platform or in connection with other fraudulent transaction on our platform well other payment dispute with consumer accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting chargebacks we must also continually implement and evolve measure to detect and reduce the risk of fraud in particular these method become increasingly sophisticated if we are unable to successfully combat the use of fraudulent payment card on our platform our business profit margin result of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected we are processing more of our transaction on merchant basis where we facilitate payment from traveler through the use of payment card and other payment method such paypal alipay paytm and wechat pay while processing transaction on merchant basis allows to process transaction for property that do not otherwise accept payment card and to increase our ability to offer variety of payment method and flexible transaction term to consumer we incur additional payment processing cost which are typically higher for foreign currency transaction and other cost related to these transaction such cost related to fraudulent payment and transaction and fraud detection we expand our payment service to consumer and business partner in addition to the revenue from these transaction we may experience significant increase in these cost and our result of operation and profit margin could be materially adversely affected in particular if we experience significant increase in non variable cost related to fraudulent payment and transaction greater percentage of our transaction involve processing payment our global system and process must be managed on larger scale which add complexity administrative burden and cost and increase the demand on our system and control which could adversely affect our result of operation in addition our payment processing activity continue to develop we expect to be subject to additional regulation including financial service regulation which we expect to result in increased compliance cost and complexity including those associated with the implementation of new or advanced internal control for example the payment service directive implemented in the uk through the payment service regulation ha further complicated the authentication process for accepting payment card and other payment method result of this payment made on our platform by consumer in the uk and the european economic area are subject to strong customer authentication which requires the consumer to engage in additional step to authenticate their transaction this new requirement could cause consumer transaction to take longer to process or otherwise inconvenience the consumer which could result in consumer choosing not to utilize our platform often or at all the implementation of this process ha resulted and may continue to result in increased compliance cost and administrative burden for additionally except where consumer ha acted fraudulently the consumer will not be liable for any loss incurred in respect of an unauthorized payment transaction where strong customer authentication should have been applied but we did not require it may determine that certain aspect of our business are subject to law that govern payment activity such money transmission and online payment processing which could require to obtain license to continue to operate in certain jurisdiction or result in modification of our business plan regulation relating to operational resilience banking privacy and security of our process could also apply to further our payment system are susceptible to illegal and improper us including money laundering terrorist financing fraudulent sale of good or service and transaction by or with sanctioned party we have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resource to comply with applicable law and regulation and failure to maintain compliance could lead to fine or require to modify or interrupt our business practice plan or operation any of which could negatively impact our business result of operation and profit margin we are also subject to payment card association rule and obligation under our contract with the card scheme and our payment card processor and indirectly to the rule of payment system in respect of credit account to account transfer the rule of the card scheme and payment system are updated in cycle and we may need to adjust our system and or process to comply with any updated obligation card association rule include the payment card industry data security standard the standard under the standard and these association rule and obligation if information is compromised we could be liable to payment card issuer for associated expense and penalty and in some case we could be restricted in our ability to accept payment card under certain circumstance in our agreement with the card scheme and in relation to the standard we are also subject to periodic audit self assessment and other assessment of our compliance with the rule and obligation of the payment card association and the standard which could result in additional expense and administrative burden in addition if we fail to follow payment card industry security standard even if no consumer information is compromised we could incur significant fine or experience significant increase in payment card transaction cost additionally compliance with the standard may not prevent all security incident if we are fined or required to pay additional processing fee or if our ability to accept payment card is restricted in any way result of our failure to comply with these payment card industry rule or otherwise it could adversely impact our business result of operation and profit margin we rely on bank card scheme and other payment processor to execute certain component of the payment process for inbound payment we pay these third party interchange fee and other processing and gateway fee to help facilitate payment from consumer to travel service provider result if we are unable to maintain our relationship with these third party on favorable term or if these fee are increased for any reason our profit margin business and result of operation could be harmed additionally if these third party experience service disruption or if they cease operation whether result of the covid pandemic or otherwise consumer and travel service provider could have difficulty making or receiving payment which could adversely impact our reputation business and result of operation in addition in the event that one of our major travel service provider voluntarily or involuntarily declares bankruptcy or otherwise cease or limit operation we could experience an increase in chargebacks from customer with travel reservation with such travel service provider and we could experience financial loss from certain prepayment made to such travel service provider if we are not able to recover the prepayment result of the covid pandemic and the ensuing effect on travel many customer canceled flight in exchange for credit for future travel if customer are not able to use these credit before they expire and we are ultimately responsible for chargebacks directly or through the travel service provider including situation where we are unable to recover from the travel service provider it could result in corresponding negative impact on our result increased focus on our environmental social and governance esg responsibility have and will likely continue to result in additional cost and risk and may adversely impact our reputation employee retention and willingness of customer and partner to do business with investor proxy advisory service regulatory authority and other stakeholder are increasingly focused on esg practice of company we are moving towards setting esg goal and enhancing related disclosure of goal progress and other matter relating to esg our effort to accomplish and accurately disclose esg related goal and objective present numerous operational reputational financial legal and other risk any of which could have negative impact on our business reputation and stock price our ability to achieve esg goal and initiative is subject to numerous risk including the availability and cost of limiting or eliminating our use of carbon based energy source and technology evolving regulatory requirement affecting esg standard or disclosure our ability to work with partner and provider that can meet our sustainability diversity and other standard our ability to recruit develop and retain diverse talent the impact of our organic growth and acquisition or disposition of business or operation on our esg goal and customer actual demand for esg oriented product offering which may be more expensive and le available than other option standard for tracking and reporting on esg matter are relatively new have not been harmonized and continue to evolve the disclosure framework we choose to align with may change from time to time and may result in lack of consistent or meaningful comparative data from period to period ensuring there are system and process in place to comply with the various esg tracking and reporting obligation will require management time and expense in addition our process and control may not always comply with evolving standard for identifying measuring and reporting esg metric our interpretation of reporting standard may differ from those of others and such standard may change over time any of which could result in significant revision to our goal or reported progress in achieving such goal if our esg practice do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectation and standard or regulatory requirement our reputation our ability to attract or retain employee and our attractiveness an investment business partner or acquiror could be negatively impacted similarly our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our goal target and objective or to satisfy various reporting standard within the timeline we announce or at all could also have similar negative impact and expose to government enforcement action private litigation and action by stockholder or stakeholder we face risk related to our intellectual property we regard our intellectual property critical to our success and we rely on domain name trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreement with our employee travel service provider partner and others to protect our proprietary right we have filed various application for protection of certain aspect of our intellectual property in the united state and other jurisdiction and we currently hold number of issued patent in several jurisdiction further in the future we may acquire additional patent or patent portfolio which could require significant cash expenditure however we may choose not to patent or otherwise register some of our intellectual property and instead rely on trade secret or other mean of protecting our intellectual property we have licensed in the past and may license in the future certain of our proprietary right such trademark or copyrighted material to third party and these licensee may take action that diminish the value of our proprietary right or harm our reputation we also have procured various intellectual property license from third party in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our service are made available online particularly in certain jurisdiction in which we operate in which theft of intellectual property may be more prevalent we may be required to expend significant time and resource to prevent infringement or to enforce our intellectual property right we believe that our intellectual property right help to protect our business we endeavor to defend our intellectual property right diligently but intellectual property litigation is extremely expensive and time consuming and may divert managerial attention and resource from our business objective we may not be able to successfully defend our intellectual property right or they may not be sufficient to effectively protect our business which could materially adversely affect our business brand and result of operation from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we may be subject to legal proceeding and claim relating to the intellectual property right of others and we expect that third party will continue to assert intellectual property claim against successful infringement claim against could result in significant monetary liability or prevent from operating our business or portion of our business or require to change business practice or develop non infringing intellectual property which could require significant effort and expense in addition resolution of claim may require to obtain license to use intellectual property right belonging to third party which may be expensive to procure or possibly to cease using those right altogether any of these event could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition our use of open source software could adversely affect our ability to protect our proprietary software and subject to possible litigation we use open source software in connection with our software development from time to time company that use open source software have faced claim challenging the use of open source software and or compliance with open source license term we could be subject to suit by party claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming non compliance with open source licensing term some open source license require user who distribute software containing open source to make available all or part of such software which in some circumstance could include valuable proprietary code of the user while we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in manner that would require to disclose our proprietary source code or that would otherwise breach the term of an open source agreement such use could inadvertently occur in part because open source license term are often ambiguous any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or pay damage for breach of contract could be harmful to our business result of operation or financial condition and could help our competitor develop service that are similar to or better than ours regulation and policy impacting the way corporation use cooky and other tracking technology could negatively impact the way we do business there are several privacy driven initiative that are changing the gathering and use of consumer data in the digital marketing ecosystem these include phasing out the use of third party cooky and other tracking technology by browser such safari and google chrome restriction on the use of the identifier for advertiser such the apple idfa by mobile device manufacturer the adoption of regulation by many jurisdiction that govern the use of cooky and apple icloud private relay which hide user ip address from website that the user access in favor of other ip address provided by apple partner cookie is text file that is stored on user computer or mobile device an identifier such apple idfa is unique device identifier assigned by the mobile device manufacturer which allows advertiser to recognize user across multiple mobile apps an ip address can provide geographic and other connection information to website related to the device user utilizes to connect to website server cooky ip address and other tracking technology are common tool used by thousand of website and mobile apps including ours to among other thing store or gather data remember log on detail so user doe not have to re enter them when revisiting website or opening an app market to consumer and enhance the user experience google chrome ha announced that they will not permit the use of third party cooky on chrome starting in mid and other browser have already stopped their use apple ha begun to require app developer to gain consent to use the idfa and other identifier with their own consent framework apple paying icloud customer who update to current version of io ipados and have access to the new icloud private relay when using the safari browser to hide such user ip address from website many jurisdiction including the european union and california have adopted regulation governing the use of cooky while these initiative will likely impact small portion of our digital advertising practice these change are not unique to the digital advertising at our company while we believe that our primary performance marketing spend will not be directly impacted by these change we are poised to utilize alternative digital marketing technique for the portion of our marketing spend that could be impacted to the extent any of these restriction and regulation impair our ability to serve certain customer in the most optimal manner or if we are le effective than our competitor in addressing this change our ability to continue to improve and optimize performance on our platform our business market share and result of operation could be adversely affected further any failure to comply with these privacy regulation could result in fine and harm to our reputation financial risksour liquidity credit rating and ongoing access to capital could be materially and negatively affected by the impact of the covid pandemic our continued access to source of liquidity depends on multiple factor including global economic condition the condition of global financial market the availability of sufficient amount of financing our ability to meet debt covenant requirement our operating performance and our credit rating since the covid pandemic there ha been increased volatility in the financial and security market which ha generally made access to capital le certain further if our credit rating were to be downgraded or if financing source were to ascribe higher risk to our rating level our industry or our access to capital and the cost of any financing would be negatively impacted we currently have billion available under our revolving credit facility which provides an additional potential source of liquidity the revolving credit facility contains certain financial covenant compliance with which is condition to our ability to borrow thereunder there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the covenant requirement at any particular time and our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility depends on such compliance further the lender have the right to require repayment of any amount borrowed under the facility if we are not in compliance there is no guarantee that additional debt financing will be available in the future to fund our obligation or that it will be available on commercially reasonable term in which case we may need to seek other source of funding in addition the term of future debt agreement could include more restrictive covenant which could restrict our business operation see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation liquidity and capital resource for more information on our liquidity and capital resource we are exposed to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate we conduct substantial majority of our business outside the united state but we report our result in dollar result we face exposure to movement in foreign currency exchange rate the financial result of our business outside of the are translated from local currency principally euro and british pound sterling into dollar when the strengthens against other currency in which we transact our foreign currency denominated net asset gross booking revenue operating expense and net

our financial result recent year have seen volatility in the exchange rate between the euro the british pound sterling the dollar and other currency significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate can affect consumer travel behavior consumer traveling from country whose currency ha weakened against other currency may book lower adr accommodation choose to shorten or cancel their international travel plan or choose to travel domestically rather than internationally any of which could adversely affect our gross booking revenue and result of operation in particular when expressed in dollar volatility in foreign currency exchange rate and it impact on consumer behavior which may differ across region make it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trend and the timing and degree of their impact on our market and business which in turn make it more difficult to manage our business and forecast our financial and operational performance our stock price is highly volatile the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuation in response to factor such the following some of which are beyond our control financial or operating result that vary from the expectation of security analyst and investor or any publicly disclosed estimate quarterly variation in our financial or operating result

covid pandemic or other event announcement by third party of significant claim or initiation of litigation proceeding against or adverse development in pending proceeding addition or departure of key personnel and trading volume fluctuation or other market volatility sale of substantial number of share of our common stock including through the conversion of our convertible note could adversely affect the market price of our common stock by introducing large number of seller or short seller to the market given the volatility that exists for our share such sale could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly in addition fluctuation in our stock price and our price to earnings multiple may have made or may make our stock attractive to momentum hedge or day trading investor who often shift fund into and out of stock rapidly exacerbating price fluctuation in either direction particularly when viewed on quarterly basis the trading price of internet company stock in general including ours have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuation to the extent that the public perception of the prospect of internet or commerce or travel company is negative our stock price could decline regardless of our result other broad market and industry factor may decrease the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance market fluctuation well general political and economic condition could cause our stock price to decline negative market condition could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or the value of our stock for purpose of acquiring other company or business in the past we have been defendant in security class action litigation security class action litigation ha often been brought against company following period of volatility in the market price of it security to the extent our stock price decline or is volatile we may in the future be the target of additional litigation this additional litigation could result in substantial cost and divert management attention and resource either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation we face increased risk if the level of our debt increase we have substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future including through public or private offering of debt security our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have significant consequence which may be amplified if our cash flow and earnings decrease we experienced result of the covid pandemic and which could include requiring the dedication of portion of our cash flow from operation to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purpose including capital expenditure meeting our operating expense share repurchase and acquisition increased vulnerability to downturn in our business competitive pressure and adverse change in general economic and industry condition decreased or lost ability to obtain additional financing on term acceptable to for working capital capital expenditure acquisition share repurchase or other general corporate purpose and decreased flexibility when planning for or reacting to change in our business and industry our ability to make payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to the rate of economic and travel industry recovery result of the covid pandemic general economic condition industry cycle and financial business and other factor affecting our result of operation and financial condition many of which are beyond our control further we may not have access to equity or debt market or other source of financing or such financing may not be available to on commercially reasonable term to repay or refinance our debt it come due or in the case of our convertible note upon conversion the value of our investment could decline which could adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation we maintain an investment portfolio of various holding type and maturity our portfolio typically includes marketable debt security equity security of publicly traded company the value of which are subject to market price volatility and investment in private company credit loss impairment and change in the fair value of our investment be volatile and they have had and are likely to continue to have significant impact on our quarterly net income or loss see note to our consolidated financial statement our investment in private company are inherently risky in that such company are typically at an early stage of development may have no or limited revenue may not be or ever become profitable may not be able to secure additional funding or their technology service or product may not be successfully developed or introduced to the market further our ability to liquidate any such investment is typically dependent on liquidity event such public offering or acquisition no public market exists for such security valuation of privately held company are inherently complex and uncertain due to the lack of liquid market for such security if we determine that any of our equity investment in such company have experienced decline in value we are required to recognize the change in net income for investment classified debt security any decline in value attributed to credit loss is also recognized in the consolidated statement of operation we have invested in security of certain chinese internet company meituan didi and trip com group see note and to our consolidated financial statement for more information regarding such investment the value of these security is subject to the risk associated with those company respective business well any change by the chinese government in foreign investment law or elevated scrutiny or regulation of foreign investment in chinese company for example meituan is cayman island company operating in china through what is commonly referred to variable interest entity or vie structure where it conduct part of it business through contractual relationship with affiliated chinese entity although vie structure are commonly used by chinese internet and commerce company there are substantial uncertainty regarding the interpretation and application of prc law and regulation to vie structure and it is possible that the prc government may view the vie structure violation of prc law vie contractual relationship are not effective in providing control over the affiliated chinese company direct ownership and meituan would have to rely on the prc legal system to enforce those contract in the event of breach by one of these entity further conflict of interest could arise to the extent meituan officer or director are also shareholder officer or director of the affiliated chinese entity any of these risk could materially and adversely affect meituan business and therefore the value of our investment in meituan similar vie structure consideration and risk apply with respect to our investment in security of didi and trip com group each of which is cayman island company operating in china through vie structure we could lose the full amount of any of our investment and any impairment of our investment have

rate rather than the current year period monthly average exchange rate overviewour mission is to make it easier for everyone to experience the world we connect consumer who wish to make travel reservation with travel service provider around the world through our online platform consumer can also use our meta search service to easily compare travel reservation information from hundred of online travel platform at once we also offer various other service to consumer and partner such travel related insurance product and restaurant management service to restaurant we offer these service through six primary consumer facing brand booking com priceline agoda rentalcars com kayak and opentable we continue to increase the collaboration cooperation and interdependency among our brand to provide consumer with the most comprehensive service see note to the consolidated financial statement segment reporting for information on our operating segment the result of our business outside of the consist of the result of booking com agoda and rentalcars com in their entirety and the part of the kayak and opentable business located outside of the this classification is independent of where the consumer resides where the consumer is physically located while using our service or the location of the travel service provider or restaurant for example reservation made through booking com which is domiciled in the netherlands at hotel in new york by consumer in the is part of the result of our business outside of the in the revenue from our business outside of the the substantial majority of which is generated by booking com through facilitating accommodation reservation represented approximately of our consolidated revenue see note to the consolidated financial statement for more geographic information we derive substantially all of our revenue from enabling consumer to make travel service reservation we also earn revenue from advertising service restaurant reservation and restaurant management service and various other service such travel related insurance revenue trendsthe covid pandemic and the resulting implementation of travel restriction by government around the world resulted in significant decline in travel activity and consumer demand for related service in in particular accommodation room night which include the impact of cancellation declined rapidly the covid pandemic spread in the first quarter of and the beginning of the second quarter of since the beginning of the second quarter of and through accommodation room night decline versus the comparable period in have generally improved government imposed travel restriction have eased vaccine and other medical intervention have become more widespread and consumer demand for travel ha started to rebound however there have been period of worsening trend due to spike in covid case and newly implemented travel restriction primarily related to new variant have observed an improvement in cancellation rate since the high in april though we have seen period of elevated cancellation rate typically coinciding with significant increase in covid case and newly imposed restriction the cancellation rate in improved meaningfully when compared to but remained percentage point higher than in in higher share of our room night were booked with flexible cancellation policy compared to and which could result in higher than normal cancellation rate in future quarter increase in cancellation rate can negatively impact our marketing efficiency and we may see increased customer service cost we did early in the covid pandemic in we saw an increase in the share of room night booked for international travel traveler booking stay at property located outside their own country versus however the share remained well below level since the second quarter of the share of room night booked for international travel ha been substantially lower than level government imposed travel restriction have generally limited international travel more than domestic travel traveler booking stay within their own country we have seen an increase in the share of room night booked on mobile device and an increased share of mobile app booking in compared to and we also see favorable repeat direct booking behavior from consumer in our apps and they allow more opportunity to engage directly with consumer the revenue earned on mobile transaction may be le than typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing pattern for example accommodation reservation made on mobile device typically are for shorter length of stay have lower accommodation average daily rate adrs and are not made far in advance our global adrs increased in compared to due in part to change in the geographical mix of our business driven primarily by stronger room night performance in north america which is high adr region and weaker room night performance in asia which is low adr region in addition our global adrs in benefited from higher adrs in europe and north america compared to driven by rate increase across many destination type with notable strength in beach oriented leisure destination global adrs in were meaningfully below adrs due to the covid pandemic prior to the covid outbreak we observed trend of declining constant currency accommodation adrs partially driven by the negative impact of the changing geographical mix of our business lower adr region like asia were generally growing faster than higher adr region like western europe and north america well pricing pressure within local market from time to time those declining adr trend we experienced prior to the covid pandemic resulted in and could in the future result in our gross booking growing le than our room night the travel market continues to recover from the impact of the covid pandemic we expect travel industry adrs generally to increase from the pandemic low in and result our adrs to increase similarly however the pace of recovery and improvement in industry adrs remains highly uncertain prior to the covid pandemic we experienced many year of growth in our accommodation reservation service we believe this growth wa the result of among other thing the broader shift of travel purchase from offline to online the widespread adoption of mobile device and the growth of travel overall we also believe this growth wa the result of the continued innovation and execution by our team around the world to increase the number and the variety of accommodation we offer consumer increase and improve content build distribution and improve the consumer experience on our online platform well to consistently and effectively market our brand through performance and brand marketing effort the travel market recovers from the impact of the covid pandemic we expect to see higher than pre covid pandemic growth rate until we return to the level of travel market demand that we observed prior to the covid pandemic after which we expect prior trend to generally resume however we believe that we have an opportunity to grow the size of our business beyond pre covid pandemic level in both mature and le mature market we are constantly innovating to grow our business by among other thing providing best in class user experience with intuitive easy to use online platform to ensure that we are meeting the need of online consumer while aiming to exceed expectation part of these ongoing effort we have long term strategy to build more integrated offering of multiple element of travel connected by payment platform which we refer to the connected trip and we expect these effort to increase room night growth and revenue growth over time we may see negative impact on our operating margin in the near term we incur the expense associated with connected trip related investment further to the extent our non accommodation service airline ticket reservation service have lower margin and grow faster than our accommodation service whether part of the connected trip or otherwise our operating margin may be negatively affected for more information see part item risk factor we may not be able to keep up with rapid technological or other market change part of our strategy to provide more payment option to consumer and travel service provider increase the number and variety of accommodation available on booking com and enable our long term connected trip strategy booking com is increasingly processing transaction on merchant basis where it facilitates payment from traveler for the service provided this allows booking com to process transaction for travel service provider and to increase it ability to offer secure and flexible transaction term to consumer such the form and timing of payment we believe that adding these type of service offering will benefit consumer and travel service provider well our gross booking room night and earnings growth rate however this result in additional expense for personnel payment processing chargebacks including those related to fraud and other expense related to these transaction which are recorded in personnel and sale and other expense in our consolidated statement of operation well associated incremental revenue credit card rebate which are recorded in merchant revenue to the extent more of our business is generated on merchant basis we incur greater level of these merchant related expense which negatively impact our operating margin despite increase in associated incremental revenue we have established widely used and recognized commerce brand through marketing and promotional campaign our marketing expense which are comprised of performance marketing and brand marketing expense declined significantly result of the negative impact on travel demand due to the covid pandemic in our marketing expense increased significantly versus result of the improving demand environment and our own effort to invest in marketing but remained below level our performance marketing expense which represents substantial majority of our marketing expense is primarily related to the use of online search engine primarily google meta search and travel research service and affiliate marketing to generate traffic to our platform our brand marketing expense is primarily related to cost associated with producing and airing television advertising online video advertising for example on youtube and facebook online display advertising and other brand marketing total marketing expense were billion billion and billion for the year ended december and respectively marketing efficiency expressed marketing expense percentage of gross booking and performance marketing return on investment roi are impacted by number of factor that are subject to variability and are in some case outside of our control including adrs cost per click cancellation rate foreign currency exchange rate our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customer and the timing and effectiveness of our brand marketing campaign marketing efficiency can also be impacted by the extent to which consumer come directly to our platform for booking in the share of room night booked by consumer coming directly to our platform increased compared to and which benefit marketing efficiency in recent year we observed period of stable or increasing roi in roi were about in line with level and increased versus when roi were negatively impacted by significant increase in cancellation rate early in the covid pandemic we expect volatility in our roi the pandemic continues to affect travel and that roi could be negatively impacted in the future by increased level of competition and other factor when evaluating our performance marketing spend we typically consider several factor for each channel such the customer experience on the advertising platform the incremental traffic we receive and the anticipated repeat rate from particular platform see part item risk factor we rely on marketing channel to generate significant amount of traffic to our platform and grow our business and our business could be negatively affected by change in online search and meta search algorithm and dynamic or traffic generating arrangement historically our growth ha primarily been generated by the worldwide accommodation reservation business of our most significant brand booking com due in part to the availability of large number of property through booking com booking com included approximately million property on it website at december consisting of over hotel motel and resort and over million home apartment and other unique place to stay all of which were about in line with the number of property on it website at december booking com categorizes property listed on it website either hotel motel and resort which group together more traditional accommodation type including hostel and inn or home apartment and other unique place to stay also referred to alternative accommodation which encompasses all other type of accommodation including bed and breakfast villa apart hotel and beyond we intend to to improve the accommodation choice available for reservation on our platform but the number of accommodation on our platform may vary in part result of removing or adding accommodation from time to time the share of booking com room night booked for alternative accommodation property in wa about which wa about the same the share of room night in and slightly from prior to the pandemic we observed an overall longer term trend of an increasing share of room night booked for alternative accommodation property consumer demand for these type of property ha grown and we have increased the number and variety of alternative accommodation property available to consumer on booking com we may experience lower profit margin due to certain additional cost such increased customer service cost related to offering alternative accommodation on our platform our alternative accommodation business ha grown these different characteristic have negatively impacted our profit margin and this trend may continue although we believe that providing an extensive collection of property excellent customer service and an intuitive easy to use consumer experience are important factor influencing consumer decision to make reservation for many consumer particularly in certain market the price of the travel service is the primary factor determining whether consumer will book reservation discounting and couponing coupled with high degree of consumer shopping behavior is particularly common in asian market in some case our competitor are willing to make little or no profit on transaction or offer travel service at loss in order to gain market share result it is increasingly important to offer travel service such accommodation reservation at competitive price whether through discount coupon closed user group rate or loyalty program increased flexibility in cancellation policy or otherwise these initiative have resulted and in the future may result in lower adrs and lower revenue percentage of gross booking many taxing authority are increasingly focused on way to increase tax revenue and have targeted large multinational technology company in these effort result many country and some state have implemented or are considering the adoption of digital service tax or similar tax that imposes tax on revenue earned from digital advertisement or the use of online platform even when there is no physical presence in the jurisdiction currently rate for this tax range from to of revenue deemed generated in the jurisdiction the digital service tax currently in effect which we record in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operation have negatively impacted our result of operation while the organisation for economic co operation and development ha been working on multinational tax change that could require all member party to remove all digital service tax the timing and detail are not yet known for more information see part item risk factor we may have exposure to additional tax liability many national government have conducted or are conducting investigation into competitive practice within the online travel industry and we may be involved or affected by such investigation and their result some country have adopted or proposed legislation that could also affect business practice within the online travel industry for example france italy belgium and austria have passed legislation prohibiting parity contract clause in their entirety also number of government are investigating or conducting information gathering exercise with respect to compliance by online travel company otcs with consumer protection law including practice related to the display of search result and search ranking algorithm claim regarding discount disclosure of charge and availability and similar messaging in december the european commission proposed the digital market act and the digital service act which are expected to give regulator more instrument to investigate digital business and impose new rule on certain digital platform if they are determined to be gatekeeper the proposed legislation is not final and it is not known what the law will look like in their final form if regulator were to determine that we are gatekeeper under the proposed legislation we could be subject to additional rule and regulation not applicable to all our competitor and our business could be harmed for more information on these matter and their potential effect on our business see note to our consolidated financial statement and part item risk factor our business is subject to various competition consumer protection and online commerce law rule and regulation around the world and the size of our business grows scrutiny of our business by legislator and regulator in these area may intensify in general increased regulatory focus on online business including online travel business like ours could result in increased compliance cost or otherwise adversely affect our business our business outside of the represent substantial majority of our financial result but because we report our result in dollar we face exposure to movement in foreign currency exchange rate the financial result and the financial condition of our business outside of the are translated from local currency principally euro and british pound sterling into dollar result both the absolute amount of and percentage change in our foreign currency denominated net asset gross booking revenue operating expense and net income expressed in dollar are affected by foreign currency exchange rate change for example total revenue from our business outside of the increased by in compared to but without the impact of change in foreign currency exchange rate increased year over year on constant currency basis by approximately since our expense are generally denominated in foreign currency on basis similar to our revenue our operating margin have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuation we certain portion of the aggregate principal value of our euro denominated debt hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the net investment in certain euro functional currency subsidiary foreign currency transaction gain or loss on the euro denominated debt that is not designated hedging instrument for accounting purpose are recognized in other income expense net in the consolidated statement of operation see note to our consolidated financial statement such foreign currency transaction gain or loss are dependent on the amount of net asset of the euro functional currency subsidiary the amount of the euro denominated debt that is designated hedge and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate for more information see part item risk factor we are exposed to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate we generally enter into derivative instrument to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation on our transactional balance denominated in currency other than the functional currency we will continue to evaluate the use of derivative instrument in the future see note to our consolidated financial statement for additional information related to our derivative contract outlookin december the spread of the omicron variant and renewed travel restriction in certain market contributed to decline in room night relative to december in january we saw room night decline about relative to january and in the first half of february room night were about in line with the first half of february in each case primarily driven by improving room night trend in europe given these rapid change particularly during the last six week we can not accurately predict the number of room night that will be booked in the first quarter of following from the for the first quarter of we currently expect the change in gross booking relative to the first quarter of will be several percentage point better than the change in room night for the same period primarily due to an increase in accommodation adrs revenue percentage of gross booking will be lower than it wa in the first quarter of and we will have an operating profit in the first quarter of seasonality and other timing factorsprior to the covid pandemic our gross booking were generally similar in the first three quarter of the year and higher than in the fourth quarter we generally recognize our marketing activity the expense is incurred which is typically in the quarter when the gross booking for the associated reservation are recognized however we would generally recognize revenue from these booking when the travel begin at check in and accommodation check in in europe and north america are generally highest in the third quarter during those region peak summer travel season and lowest in the first quarter result of this timing difference between when we record marketing expense and when we generally recognize associated revenue we typically experience our highest level of profitability in the third quarter and our lowest level of profitability in the first quarter in addition to the typical seasonality effect on our business our quarterly result and quarterly year over year growth rate can be impacted by the length of the booking window the average time between the booking of travel reservation and when the travel begin which impact the relationship between our gross booking recognized at the time of booking and our revenue recognized at the time of check in the level of acceleration or deceleration in the gross booking growth rate for example our operating margin are typically negatively impacted in the near term from gross booking and related variable marketing expense growth acceleration revenue growth is typically le impacted by accelerating gross booking growth in the near term any such acceleration would positively impact revenue growth in subsequent period portion of the revenue recognized from such gross booking will occur in future quarter conversely in period where our gross booking growth rate substantially decelerates our operating margin typically benefit and the date on which certain holiday easter and ramadan fall the covid pandemic impacted the booking window and seasonality of our business in and for example in we saw contraction of the booking window an increased percentage of booking were made for travel that wa to occur close to the time of booking it is difficult to accurately predict travel pattern given the covid pandemic and we may not experience typical seasonality effect on our business throughout the duration of the pandemic and potentially for some time thereafter the travel market recovers from the impact of the covid pandemic we expect to see period of booking growth rate acceleration which will likely result in period where our operating margin are negatively impacted due to the timing difference of when marketing expense is recorded and when revenue is recognized other factorswe believe that our future success depends in large part on our ability to continue to profitably grow our brand worldwide and over time to offer other travel and travel related service factor beyond our control such terrorist attack extreme weather or natural disaster travel related health concern including pandemic and epidemic such covid war and regional hostility travel related accident or increased focus on the environmental impact of travel can disrupt travel limit the ability or willingness of traveler to visit certain location or otherwise result in decline in travel demand negatively affecting our business and result of operation see part item risk factor the covid pandemic ha materially adversely affected and may further adversely impact our business and financial performance and decline or disruption in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance the extent of the effect of the covid pandemic on our business result of operation cash flow and growth prospect is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future development while we have seen sign of recovery in travel demand in most part of the world we continue to expect that our business will be adversely impacted by surge of covid case count including those driven by variant of covid well any government imposed travel restriction in reaction to covid outbreak which could remain risk for an extended period of time over the long term we intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion technology and personnel within parameter consistent with attempt to improve long term operating result even if those expenditure create pressure on operating margin in recent year we have experienced pressure on operating margin we invested in initiative to drive future growth we also intend to broaden the scope of our business including exploring strategic alternative such acquisition the competition for technology talent in our industry ha intensified including among established technology company startup and company transitioning to digital the competition for talent is exacerbated by an increased willingness of certain company to offer flexible and remote working policy which expands the pool of candidate from which our competitor may attract talent this could continue in the future due to an actual or perceived slower pace of recovery of the travel industry result of the covid pandemic than other industry and other factor beyond our control result of the highly competitive labor market our personnel expense to attract and retain key talent are increasing which may adversely affect our result of operation see part item risk factor we rely on the performance of highly skilled employee and if we are unable to retain or motivate key employee or attract retain and motivate well qualified employee our business would be harmed critical accounting estimatesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation is based upon our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state gaap our significant accounting policy and estimate are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statement certain of our accounting estimate are particularly important to our financial position and result of operation and require to make difficult and subjective judgment often result of the need to make estimate of matter that are inherently uncertain we use our judgment to determine the appropriate assumption to be used in the determination of certain estimate and we evaluate our estimate on an ongoing basis estimate are based on historical experience term of existing contract our observance of trend in the travel industry and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance our actual result may differ from these estimate under different assumption or condition matter that involve significant estimate and judgment of management include the following valuation of goodwill and other long lived assetsthe application of the acquisition method of accounting for business combination requires the use of significant estimate and assumption to determine the fair value of the asset acquired and liability assumed our estimate of the fair value are based upon assumption that we believe are reasonable when we deem appropriate we utilize assistance from third party valuation firm the consideration transferred is allocated to the asset acquired and liability assumed based on their respective fair value at the acquisition date the excess of the consideration transferred over the net of the amount allocated to the identifiable asset acquired and liability assumed is recognized goodwill goodwill is assigned to reporting unit that are expected to benefit from the synergy of the business combination substantial portion of our intangible asset and goodwill relates to the acquisition of opentable kayak and getaroom see note to our consolidated financial statement for further information related to the acquisition of getaroom in december we review long lived asset whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based upon the ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the estimated undiscounted future net cash flow before interest and tax of the related asset group of december no impairment indicator were identified for our long lived asset we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual test if an event occurs or circumstance change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting unit below it carrying amount we test goodwill at reporting unit level and our annual goodwill impairment test are performed of september of september we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that there wa no impairment of goodwill no additional impairment indicator were identified of december interim goodwill impairment testdue to the significant and negative financial impact of the covid pandemic see note to our consolidated financial statement we performed an interim period goodwill impairment test at march and recognized goodwill impairment charge of million related to the opentable and kayak reporting unit for the three month ended march which is not tax deductible resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for opentable and kayak of billion at march the goodwill impairment wa primarily driven by significant reduction in the forecasted near term cash flow of opentable and kayak well the significant decline in comparable company market value result of the covid pandemic the estimated fair value of opentable and kayak wa determined using combination of standard valuation technique including an income approach discounted cash flow and market approach applying the recent decline in enterprise value of comparable publicly traded company to the recently calculated fair value for opentable and kayak well applying comparable company multiple the income approach estimate fair value utilizing long term growth rate and discount rate applied to the cash flow projection in the cash flow projection we assumed at the time that opentable and kayak would experience significant decline in near term cash flow with recovery to level of financial performance including profitability occurring in the shape and timing of the recovery wa key assumption in our fair value calculation both in the income and market approach annual goodwill impairment testa of september we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recognized goodwill impairment charge of million for the opentable and kayak reporting unit for the three month ended september which is not tax deductible resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for opentable and kayak of billion at september the goodwill impairment wa primarily driven by significant reduction in the forecasted cash flow of opentable and kayak reflecting longer assumed recovery period to level of profitability mainly due to the continued material adverse impact of the covid pandemic including it impact on the flight vertical at kayak and the lowered outlook for monetization opportunity in restaurant reservation service the estimated fair value of opentable and kayak wa determined using combination of standard valuation technique including an income approach discounted cash flow and market approach applying comparable company multiple the income approach estimate fair value utilizing long term growth rate and discount rate applied to the cash flow projection the income approach applied of september reflected reduction in the forecasted cash flow of opentable and kayak and longer assumed recovery period to level of profitability driven primarily by lowered outlook for monetization opportunity in restaurant reservation service and slower than previously expected recovery trend for airline travel which is key vertical for kayak for the interim goodwill impairment test at march we expected recovery to level of financial performance occurring in for opentable and kayak based on our evaluation of all relevant information available of september for the annual goodwill impairment test we expected at the time that opentable and kayak would not return to the level of profitability within five year from that date and that it wa uncertain whether the shape of the recovery would ultimately match our expectation an increase or decrease of one point to the profitability growth rate used in the cash flow projection would have resulted in an increase or decrease of approximately million to the estimated fair value of opentable and kayak of september the discount rate is determined based on the reporting unit estimated weighted average cost of capital and adjusted to reflect the risk inherent in it cash flow which requires significant judgment the discount rate used for the annual goodwill impairment test of september wa higher than the discount rate used for the interim goodwill impairment test of march if the discount rate used in the income approach increase or decrease by the impact to the estimated fair value of opentable and kayak at september would have ranged from decrease of approximately million to an increase of approximately million the estimation of fair value of our reporting unit reflect numerous assumption that are subject to various risk and uncertainty including key assumption regarding each reporting unit expected growth rate and operating margin expected length and severity of the impact from the covid pandemic the shape and timing of the subsequent recovery and the competitive environment well other key assumption with respect to matter outside of our control such discount rate and market comparables it requires significant judgment and estimate and actual result could be materially different than the judgment and estimate used to estimate fair value future event and changing market condition may lead to re evaluate the assumption used to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit particularly the assumption related to the length and severity of the covid pandemic and the shape and timing of the subsequent recovery which may result in need to recognize additional goodwill impairment charge that could have material adverse effect on our result of operation valuation of investment in private companiessee note to our consolidated financial statement for additional information related to the investment in private company see note to our consolidated financial statement for additional information on fair value measurement including the three level of input to measure fair value when input that are observable either directly or indirectly observable market data is available at the measurement date and is not significantly adjusted using unobservable input the observable input would be classified level input when little or no market data is available the fair value of these investment are measured using unobservable input level input of december our investment measured using level input primarily consisted of preferred stock investment in privately held company that were classified either debt security or equity security without readily determinable fair value fair value of privately held security are estimated using variety of valuation methodology including both market and income approach we have used valuation technique appropriate for the type of investment and the information available about the investee of the valuation date to determine fair value recent financing transaction in the investee such new investment in preferred stock are generally considered the best indication of the enterprise value and therefore used basis to estimate fair value however based on number of factor such the proximity in timing to the valuation date or the volume or other term of these financing transaction we may also use other valuation technique to supplement this data including the income approach in addition an option pricing model opm is utilized to allocate value to the various class of security of the investee including the class owned by the model includes assumption around the investees expected time to liquidity and volatility our investment in preferred share of grab holding inc which wa classified debt security for accounting purpose at december had an aggregate estimated fair value of million at december we measured this investment using level input and management estimate that incorporated the current market participant expectation of future cash flow considered alongside recent financing transaction of the investee and other relevant information in december pursuant to business combination transaction involving grab holding inc grab holding limited grab and altimeter growth corp the grab transaction the preferred share were converted to class ordinary share of grab and such ordinary share began publicly trading on the nasdaq stock market result the company investment wa classified equity security with readily determinable fair value see note to our consolidated financial statement at december the investment had fair value of million for our investment in the equity security of didi global inc didi considering the impact of the covid pandemic see note to our consolidated financial statement we performed an impairment analysis of march that resulted in an adjusted carrying value of million at each of march and december result of didi initial public offering in june we reclassified our didi investment equity security with readily determinable fair value at december the investment had fair value of million we had million invested in yanolja co ltd yanolja at december and in july yanolja announced new round of funding into the company the new round of funding and certain other transaction in the equity security of yanolja were completed in october result of these observable transaction we recorded an unrealized of million in other income expense net in the consolidated statement of operation for the year ended december that resulted in an adjusted carrying value of million at december see note to our consolidated financial statement the determination of the fair value of investment in private company where we are minority shareholder and have access to limited information from the investee reflects numerous assumption that are subject to various risk and uncertainty including key assumption regarding the investee expected growth rate and operating margin expected length and severity of the impact of the covid pandemic on the investee and the shape and timing of the subsequent recovery well other key assumption with respect to matter outside of our control such discount rate and market comparables it requires significant judgment and estimate and actual result could be materially different than those judgment and estimate utilized in the fair value estimate future event and changing market condition may lead to re evaluate the assumption reflected in our valuation particularly the assumption related to the length and severity of the covid pandemic and the shape and timing of the recovery and the overall impact on the investee business which may result in need to recognize an additional impairment charge that could have material adverse effect on our result of operation income tax we determine our tax expense based on our income and statutory tax rate applicable in the various jurisdiction in which we operate due to the complex nature of tax legislation and frequent change with such associated legislation significant judgment is required in computing our tax expense and determining our tax position the tax cut and job act the tax act enacted in december made significant change to federal tax law including one time deemed repatriation tax imposed on accumulated unremitted international earnings to be paid over eight year we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest our international earnings that were subject to taxation pursuant to the mandatory deemed repatriation or subject to taxation global intangible low taxed income gilti we regularly review our deferred tax asset for recoverability considering historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversal of temporary difference and tax planning strategy and record valuation allowance required we are subject to ongoing tax examination and assessment in various jurisdiction we have been audited in many jurisdiction and from time to time face challenge regarding the amount of tax due these challenge include question regarding the timing and amount of deduction that we have taken on our tax return although we believe that our tax filing position are reasonable and comply with applicable law we regularly review our tax filing position especially in light of tax law or business practice change and we may change our position or determine that previous position should be amended either of which could result in additional tax liability the final determination of tax audit or tax dispute may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accrual the evaluation of tax position and recognition of income tax benefit require significant judgement and we consult with external tax and legal counsel appropriate we consider the technical merit of our tax position along with the applicable tax statute related interpretation and precedent and our expectation of the outcome of proceeding or negotiation with tax authority we recognize liability when we believe that uncertain position may not be fully sustained upon audit by the tax authority including any related appeal or litigation process liability recognized for uncertain tax position are based on two step approach for recognition and measurement first we evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on it technical merit second we measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement interest and penalty attributable to uncertain tax position if any are recognized component of income tax expense the tax benefit ultimately realized by may be different than what is recorded in the financial statement due to future event such our settling the matter with the tax authority and our success in sustaining our tax position see note and to our consolidated financial statement for further information contingenciesloss contingency other than income tax related contingency disclosed above arise from actual or possible claim and assessment and pending or threatened litigation that may be brought against by individual government or other entity based on our assessment of loss contingency at each balance sheet date loss is recorded in the financial statement if it is probable that an asset ha been impaired or liability ha been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated if the amount of the loss can not be reasonably estimated we disclose information about the contingency in the financial statement we also disclose information in our financial statement about reasonably possible loss contingency determination of whether loss is probable and whether the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated requires significant judgment and evaluation of all the underlying fact and circumstance including judgment about the potential action of third party claimant regulatory authority and court claim assessment and litigation involve significant uncertainty such the complexity of the fact the legal theory involved the nature of the claim the judgment of the court the applicable methodology for determining potential damage and in the case of class action whether class action can be certified and the extent to which member of class would or would not file claim on quarterly basis we update our analysis and estimate considering all available information including the impact of negotiation settlement ruling and advice of legal counsel change in our assessment of whether loss is probable our estimate of the loss or our determination of whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated could have material impact on our result of operation and financial position change in our assumption regarding particular matter or the effectiveness of our strategy related to legal and other proceeding could also have material impact on our result of operation and financial position for all loss contingency until matter is finally resolved there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the liability accrued for the matter and such amount could be material see note to our consolidated financial statement for further information recent accounting pronouncement see note to our consolidated financial statement for detail

subsidiary did not receive sufficient compensation for the service it rendered to booking com result of formal demand from the french tax authority for payment of the amount assessed against booking com for the year through in january we paid the assessment of approximately million euro million in order to preserve our right to contest those assessment in court the payment which is included in other asset net in the consolidated balance sheet at december and doe not constitute an admission that we owe the tax and will be refunded with interest to to the extent we prevail in december and october we initiated court proceeding with respect to certain of the assessment although we believe that booking com ha been and continues to be in compliance with french tax law and we are contesting the assessment during the three month ended september we contacted the french tax authority regarding the potential to achieve resolution of the matter through settlement after assessing several potential outcome and potential settlement amount and term an unrecognized tax benefit in the amount of million euro million wa recorded during the year ended december of which the majority wa included partial reduction to the tax payment recorded in other asset net in the consolidated balance sheet at december and in december the french administrative court conseil etat delivered decision in the valueclick case that could have an impact on the outcome in our case after considering the potential adverse impact of the new decision on the potential outcome for the booking com assessment we currently estimate that the reasonably possible loss related to vat is approximately million euro million for additional information related to the french and other tax assessment see note to our consolidated financial statement and part item risk factor we may have exposure to additional tax liability beginning in booking com received several letter from the netherlands pension fund for the travel industry reiswerk bpf claiming that booking com is required to participate in the mandatory pension scheme of the bpf with retroactive effect to which ha higher contribution rate than the pension scheme in which booking com is currently participating bpf instituted legal proceeding against booking com and in the district court of amsterdam rejected all of bpf claim bpf appealed the decision to the court of appeal and in may the court of appeal also rejected all of bpf claim in each case by ruling that booking com doe not meet the definition of travel intermediary for purpose of the mandatory pension scheme bpf then appealed to the netherlands supreme court in april the supreme court overturned the previous decision of the court of appeal and held that booking com meet the definition of travel intermediary for the purpose of the mandatory pension scheme the supreme court ruled only on the qualification of booking com travel intermediary for the purpose of the mandatory pension scheme and did not rule on the various other defense we brought forward against bpf claim the supreme court referred the matter to another court of appeal that will have to ass the other defense we brought forward if bpf were to proceed with the litigation we intend to pursue number of defense in any subsequent proceeding and may ultimately prevail in whole or in part while we continue to believe that booking com is in compliance with it pension obligation and that the court of appeal could ultimately rule in favor of booking com given the supreme court decision we believe it is probable that we have incurred loss related to this matter we are not able to reasonably estimate loss or range of loss because there are significant factual and legal question yet to be determined in any subsequent proceeding result of december we have not recorded liability in connection with potential adverse ultimate outcome to this litigation however if booking com were to ultimately lose and all of bpf claim were to be accepted including with retroactive effect to we estimate that of december the maximum loss not including any potential interest or penalty would be approximately million euro million such estimated potential loss increase booking com continues not to contribute to the bpf and depends on booking com applicable compensation after december for additional information related to the pension matter and our other contingent liability see note to our consolidated financial statement item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have exposure to several type of market risk change in interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and equity price we manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policy and procedure and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instrument we use foreign currency exchange derivative contract to manage short term foreign currency risk the objective of our policy is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and fair value exposure resulting from possible future adverse fluctuation in rate we evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near term and long term fluctuation in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate this evaluation includes the review of leading market indicator discussion with financial analyst and investment banker regarding current and future economic condition and the review of market projection to expected future rate we utilize this information to determine our own investment strategy well to determine if the use of derivative financial instrument is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face our policy doe not allow speculation in derivative instrument for profit or execution of derivative instrument contract for which there are no underlying exposure we do not use financial instrument for trading purpose and are not party to any leveraged derivative to the extent that change in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate affect general economic condition we would also be affected by such change at december and the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our debt wa billion and billion respectively we estimate that the fair value of such debt wa approximately billion and billion at december and respectively the estimated fair value of our debt in excess of the outstanding principal amount at december and primarily relates to the conversion premium on the convertible senior note and the outstanding senior note issued in april excluding the effect on the fair value of our convertible senior note hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rate would have resulted in an increase in the estimated fair value of our other debt of approximately million and million at december and respectively our convertible senior note are more sensitive to the equity market price volatility of our share than change in interest rate the fair value of the convertible senior note will likely increase the market price of our share increase and will likely decrease the market price of our share fall our business outside of the represent substantial majority of our financial result therefore because we report our result in dollar we face exposure to movement in foreign currency exchange rate the financial result and the financial condition of our business outside of the are translated from local currency principally euro and british pound sterling into dollar if the dollar weakens against the local currency the translation of these foreign currency denominated balance will result in increased net asset gross booking revenue operating expense and net income similarly our net asset gross booking revenue operating expense and net income will decrease if the dollar strengthens against the local currency for example total revenue from our business outside of the increased by in compared to but without the impact of change in foreign currency exchange rate increased year over year on constant currency basis by approximately since our expense are generally denominated in foreign currency on basis similar to our revenue our operating margin have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuation additionally foreign

euro functional currency subsidiary the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on the euro denominated debt that is not designated hedging instrument for accounting purpose are recognized in other income expense net in our consolidated statement of operation see note to our consolidated financial statement such foreign currency transaction gain or loss are dependent on the amount of net asset of the euro functional currency subsidiary the amount of the euro denominated debt that is designated hedge and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate generally enter into derivative instrument to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation on our transactional balance denominated in currency other than the functional currency we will continue to evaluate the use of derivative instrument in the future see note to our consolidated financial statement for additional information related to our derivative contract we are exposed to equity price risk it relates to change in fair value of our investment in equity security of publicly traded company and private company we recorded net loss of million and net gain of billion and million related to these equity security for the year ended december and respectively see note and to our consolidated financial statement the estimated fair value of our investment in equity security of publicly traded company and private company excluding investment classified debt security for accounting purpose were billion and million respectively at december and billion and million respectively at december our investment in private company excluding investment classified debt security for accounting purpose are measured at cost le impairment if any such investment are also required to be measured at fair value of the date of certain observable transaction for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer hypothetical decrease in the fair value at december and of our investment in equity security of
