see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation in part ii item below and note subsequent event to our consolidated financial statement in part ii item below industry overview the global retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industry are highly competitive and have been experiencing consolidation in recent year prescription drug play significant role in healthcare and constitute first line of treatment for many medical condition we believe the long term outlook for prescription drug utilization is strong due in part to aging population increase in life expectancy increase in the availability and utilization of generic drug the continued development of innovative drug that improve quality of life and control healthcare cost and increase in the number of person with insurance coverage for prescription drug including in the united state the expansion of healthcare insurance coverage under the patient protection and affordable care act the aca and baby boomer increasingly becoming eligible for the federally funded medicare part prescription program wholesaler in the pharmaceutical distribution business function vital link between drug manufacturer and pharmacy and healthcare provider in supplying pharmaceutical to patient the global retail pharmacy industry relies significantly on private and governmental third party payer many private organization throughout the healthcare industry including pharmacy benefit management pbm company and health insurance company have consolidated in recent year to create larger healthcare enterprise with greater bargaining power third party payer including the medicare part plan and the state sponsored medicaid and related managed care medicaid agency in the united state change eligibility requirement or reduce certain reimbursement rate in addition in many european country the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumer and regulates pharmaceutical price patient eligibility and reimbursement level to control cost for the government sponsored healthcare system change in law or regulation also can impact reimbursement rate and term for example the aca seek to reduce federal spending by altering the medicaid reimbursement formula amp for multi source drug and implemented is expected to reduce medicaid reimbursement state medicaid program are also expected to continue to seek reduction in reimbursement independent of amp when third party payer or governmental authority take action that restrict eligibility or reduce price or reimbursement rate sale and margin in the retail pharmacy industry could be reduced which would adversely affect industry profitability in case these possible adverse effect may be partially or entirely offset by controlling inventory cost and other expense dispensing more higher margin generic finding new revenue stream through pharmacy service or other offering and or dispensing greater volume of prescription generic prescription drug have continued to help lower overall cost for customer and third party payer we expect the utilization of generic pharmaceutical to continue to increase in general in the united state generic version of drug generate lower total sale dollar per prescription but higher gross profit margin and gross profit dollar compared with patent protected brand name drug the positive impact on retail pharmacy gross profit margin and gross profit dollar can be significant in the first several month after generic version of drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version which is generally referred to generic conversion in any given year the number of major brand name drug that undergo conversion from branded to generic status can vary and the timing of generic conversion can be difficult to predict which can have significant impact on retail pharmacy sale gross profit margin and gross profit dollar we expect that market demand government regulation third party reimbursement policy government contracting requirement and other pressure will continue to cause the industry in which we compete to evolve pharmacist are on the frontlines of the healthcare delivery system and we believe rising healthcare cost and the limited supply of primary care physician present new opportunity for pharmacist and retail pharmacy to play an even greater role in driving positive outcome for patient and payer through expanded service offering such immunization and other preventive care healthcare clinic pharmacist led medication therapy management and

presently known to or that we currently consider to be immaterial reduction in third party reimbursement level from private or governmental agency plan and potential change in industry pricing benchmark for prescription drug could adversely affect our result of operation the substantial majority of the prescription we fill are reimbursed by third party payer including private and governmental agency payer the continued effort of health maintenance organization managed care organization pharmacy benefit management company governmental agency and other third party payer to reduce prescription drug cost and pharmacy reimbursement rate well litigation relating to drug are priced may adversely impact our result of operation in the united state plan change with rate adjustment often occur in january and our reimbursement arrangement may provide for rate adjustment at prescribed interval during their term in addition some of these entity may offer pricing term that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their network of pharmacy provider table of content in the united state certain provision of the deficit reduction act of sought to reduce federal spending by altering amp the medicaid reimbursement formula for multi source generic drug while those reduction did not go into effect the aca which wa signed into law on march enacted modified amp reimbursement formula for multi source drug that significantly affect reimbursement calculation the modified formula when implemented is expected to reduce medicaid reimbursement which could adversely affect our result of operation the center for medicare and medicaid service cm is preparing to use the modified reimbursement formula to calculate federal ceiling on reimbursement rate for multi source drug to pharmacy under the medicaid program and post draft federal upper limit ful reimbursement file on the cm website that are calculated based on the requirement of the health reform legislation of the date of this report these draft ful file are for review and comment only however cm ha announced that it plan to publish final ful after period of releasing them in draft format cm ha issued proposed regulation to implement the aca provision regarding medicaid reimbursement to pharmacy but to date the regulation have not been finalized there have also been number of other proposal and enactment by the federal government and various state to reduce medicare part and medicaid reimbursement level in response to budget deficit and we expect additional proposal in the future many payer in the united state are increasingly considering new metric the basis for reimbursement rate such average sale price average manufacturer price and actual acquisition cost for example cm now make national average drug acquisition cost data which reflect retail community pharmacy invoice cost publicly available on regular basis cm ha indicated that state medicaid agency can use this information to compare their own reimbursement and pricing methodology and rate to those derived from the survey data there can be no assurance that recent or future change in prescription drug reimbursement policy and practice will not materially and adversely affect our result of operation shift in pharmacy mix toward lower margin plan and program could adversely affect our result of operation shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards program offering lower reimbursement rate could adversely affect our result of operation our retail pharmacy usa division continued to experience shift in pharmacy mix towards day at retail in fiscal and that trend is expected to continue in fiscal our day at retail offering for patient with chronic prescription need typically is at lower margin than comparable day prescription additionally we have accepted lower reimbursement rate in order to secure preferred relationship with medicare part plan serving senior patient with significant pharmacy need if we are not able to generate additional prescription volume and other business from patient participating in these program that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower reimbursement our result of operation could be materially and adversely affected we could be adversely affected by decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drug new brand name drug can result in increased drug utilization and associated sale revenue while the introduction of lower priced generic alternative typically result in relatively lower sale revenue but higher gross profit margin accordingly decrease in the number of significant new brand name drug or generic successfully introduced could materially and adversely affect our result of operation generic drug inflation could have material adverse effect on our result of operation in the united state overall increase in the amount we pay to procure generic drug commonly referred to generic drug inflation could have material adverse effect on our result of operation including particularly those of our retail pharmacy usa division our gross profit margin would be adversely affected by generic inflation to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increase we experienced shift from historical pattern of deflation in generic drug cost to inflation in fiscal when we experienced cost increase on subset of generic drug that in some case were significant this generic inflation continued with respect to certain generic drug in fiscal any failure to fully offset any such increased price and cost or to modify our activity to mitigate the impact could have material adverse effect on our result of operation table of content we derive significant portion of our sale in the united state from prescription drug sale reimbursed by pharmacy benefit management company we derive significant portion of our sale in the united state from prescription drug sale reimbursed through prescription drug plan administered by pbm company pbm company typically administer multiple prescription drug plan that expire at various time and provide for varying reimbursement rate and often limit coverage to specific drug product on an approved list known formulary which might not include all of the approved drug for particular indication there can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular pbm company pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period if our participation in the pharmacy provider network for prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large pbm company is restricted or terminated we expect that our sale would be adversely affected at least in the short term if we are unable to replace any such lost sale either through an increase in other sale or through resumption of participation in those plan our operating result could be materially and adversely affected if we exit pharmacy provider network and later resume participation there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace or that all client of the pbm company will choose to include in the pharmacy network for their plan initially or at all in addition in such circumstance we may incur increased marketing and other cost in connection with initiative to regain former patient and attract new patient covered by such plan consolidation and strategic alliance in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business operation competitive positioning financial condition and result of operation many organization in the healthcare industry including pbm company and health insurance company have consolidated in recent year to create larger healthcare enterprise with greater bargaining power which ha resulted in greater pricing pressure for example in july optumrx unitedhealth group pharmacy care service business completed it combination with catamaran corporation with the combined business expected to fulfill over one billion prescription in and be the third largest pbm company in the united state in addition significant business combination within the health insurance industry were announced in july with anthem inc announcing it agreement to acquire cigna corporation and aetna inc announcing it agreement to acquire humana inc with the resulting enterprise expected to be two of the three largest health insurer in the united state if this consolidation trend continues it could give the resulting enterprise even greater bargaining power which may lead to further pressure on the price for our product and service if these pressure result in reduction in our price our business would become le profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reduction in cost strategic alliance in the healthcare industry also impact our business and competitive positioning for example following the announcement of our agreement with amerisourcebergen providing for among other thing generic drug purchasing by walgreens alliance boot and amerisourcebergen through wbad our global sourcing enterprise some of our retail pharmacy competitor subsequently established relationship with other pharmaceutical drug wholesaler relating to generic drug procurement in addition further consolidation among generic drug manufacturer could lead to increased generic drug inflation in the future we expect that market demand government regulation third party reimbursement policy government contracting requirement and other pressure will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve potentially resulting in further business consolidation and alliance among the industry participant we engage with and which may materially and adversely impact our business operation financial condition and result of operation we may not be able to successfully or timely complete the pending acquisition of rite aid risk and uncertainty related to our pending acquisition of rite aid include among others the occurrence of any event change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement including the failure of rite aid to obtain the approval of it stockholder of the transaction that regulatory or other approval required for the transaction are not obtained that litigation may be

the funding of governmental payer in foreign jurisdiction consolidation of competitor supplier and other market participant and the development of large sophisticated purchasing group we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential change such reduction in governmental funding at the state or federal level for certain healthcare service or adverse change in legislation or regulation governing prescription drug pricing healthcare service or mandated benefit may cause customer to reduce the amount of our product and service they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our product and service we expect continued governmental and private payer pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing change in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing or distribution policy could also significantly reduce our profitability the aca wa enacted in to provide health insurance coverage to million of previously uninsured american through combination of insurance market reform an expansion of medicaid subsidy and health insurance mandate while certain provision of the aca have already taken effect others have delayed effective date or require further rulemaking action or regulatory guidance by governmental agency to implement and or finalize result there remains considerable uncertainty to the full impact of aca on our

business venture or acquisition that we complete may also impact our cash requirement see item qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk below for discussion of certain financing and market risk commitment and contingency the information set forth in note to our consolidated financial statement included in part ii item of this form is incorporated herein by reference table of content critical accounting policy the consolidated financial statement are prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america and include amount based on management prudent judgment and estimate actual result may differ from these estimate management belief that any reasonable deviation from those judgment and estimate would not have material impact on our consolidated financial position or result of operation to the extent that the estimate used differ from actual result however adjustment to the statement of earnings and corresponding balance sheet account would be necessary these adjustment would be made in future period some of the more significant estimate include business combination goodwill and other intangible asset impairment allowance for doubtful account vendor allowance asset impairment liability for closed location cost of sale and inventory equity method investment pension and postretirement benefit and income tax we use the following method to determine our estimate business combination we account for business combination using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that control is obtained all the asset acquired and liability assumed including amount attributable to noncontrolling interest be recorded at their respective fair value at the date of acquisition the determination of fair value of asset and liability acquired requires estimate and the use of valuation technique when market value is not readily available for intangible asset we typically use the income approach to determine fair value the income approach requires management to make significant estimate and assumption these estimate and assumption primarily include but are not limited to the discount rate terminal growth rate and forecast of revenue operating income depreciation and amortization and capital expenditure the discount rate which are applied to the projection reflect the risk factor associated with those projection although we believe our estimate of fair value are reasonable actual financial result could differ from those estimate due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimate change in assumption concerning future financial result or other underlying assumption could have significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible asset acquired judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset useful life different asset will have different life with some asset determined to have indefinite useful life goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstance change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting unit below it carrying value part of our impairment analysis for each reporting unit we engage third party appraisal firm to assist in the determination of estimated fair value for each reporting unit this determination includes estimating the fair value using both the income and market approach the income approach requires management to estimate number of factor for each reporting unit including projected future operating result economic projection anticipated future cash flow and discount rate the market approach estimate fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within comparable industry grouping the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit and the allocation of that value to individual asset and liability within those reporting unit requires to make significant estimate and assumption these estimate and assumption primarily include but are not limited to the selection of appropriate peer group company control premium appropriate for acquisition in the industry in which we compete the discount rate terminal growth rate and forecast of revenue operating income depreciation and amortization and capital expenditure the allocation requires several analysis to determine the fair value of asset and liability including among other thing purchased prescription file customer relationship pharmacy license and trade name although we believe our estimate of fair value are reasonable actual financial result could differ from those estimate due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimate change in assumption concerning future financial result or other underlying assumption could have significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit the amount of any goodwill impairment charge or both we also compared the sum of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the company total value implied by the market value of the company equity and debt security this comparison indicated that in total our assumption and estimate were reasonable however future decline in the overall market value of the company equity and debt security may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting unit ha declined below it carrying value one measure of the sensitivity of the amount of goodwill impairment charge to key assumption is the amount by which each reporting unit passed fair value exceeds the carrying amount or failed the carrying amount exceeds fair value the first step of the goodwill impairment test our reporting unit fair value exceeded their carrying amount ranging from approximately to more than see note goodwill and other intangible asset to the consolidated financial statement for additional information table of content indefinite lived intangible asset are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to it carrying value if the carrying value of the asset exceeds it estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written to it estimated fair value our indefinite lived intangible asset fair value is estimated by discounting the hypothetical royalty payment to their present value over the estimated economic life of the asset these estimate can be affected by number of factor including but not limited to general economic condition availability of market information well our profitability based on current knowledge we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in the estimate or assumption used to determine impairment allowance for doubtful account the provision for bad debt is based on estimate of recoverability using both historical write percentage and specifically identified receivables based on current knowledge we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in the estimate or assumption used to determine the allowance vendor allowance vendor allowance are principally received result of purchase sale or promotion of vendor product allowance are generally recorded reduction of inventory and are recognized reduction of cost of sale when the related merchandise is sold those allowance received for promoting vendor product are offset against advertising expense and result in reduction of selling general and administrative expense to the extent of advertising incurred with the excess treated reduction of inventory cost based on current knowledge we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in the estimate or assumption used to determine vendor allowance asset impairment the impairment of long lived asset is assessed based upon both qualitative and quantitative factor including year of operation and expected future cash flow and tested for impairment annually or whenever event or circumstance indicate that certain asset may be impaired if the future cash flow reveal that the carrying value of the asset group may not be recoverable an impairment charge is immediately recorded based on current knowledge we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in the estimate or assumption used to determine asset impairment liability for closed location the liability is based on the present value of future rent obligation and other related cost net of estimated sublease rent to the first lease option date based on current knowledge we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in the estimate or assumption used to determine the liability cost of sale and inventory drugstore cost of sale in the retail pharmacy usa segment is derived based on point of sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and adjusted based on periodic inventory count inventory are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the last in first lifo method for the retail pharmacy usa segment and on first in first out fifo basis for inventory in the retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale segment except for retail inventory in the retail pharmacy international segment which is valued using the retail method based on current knowledge we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in the estimate or

judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factor such our ownership interest representation on the board of director participation in policy making decision and material purchase and sale transaction based on current knowledge we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in the estimate or assumption used to determine the amount recorded for equity method investment table of content pension and postretirement benefit we have various defined benefit pension plan that cover some of our foreign employee we also have postretirement healthcare plan that cover qualifying domestic employee eligibility and the level of benefit for these plan varies depending on participant status date of hire and

performance of the investment portfolio well the long term market return expectation based on the investment mix of the portfolio our policy is to fund our pension plan in accordance with applicable regulation our postretirement healthcare plan are not funded based on current knowledge we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in the estimate or
