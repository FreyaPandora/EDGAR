growthour objective of prioritizing strong efficient growth mean we will focus on the most productive growth opportunity increasing comparable store and club sale accelerating ecommerce sale growth and expanding omni channel initiative while slowing the rate of growth of new store and club at time we make strategic investment which are focused on the long term growth of the company comparable sale is metric that indicates the performance of our existing store and club by measuring the change in sale for such store and club including ecommerce sale for particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally report comparable sale using the retail calendar also known the calendar to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable sale using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings release however when we discus our comparable sale below we are referring to our calendar comparable sale calculated using our fiscal calendar which may result in difference when compared to comparable sale using the retail calendar calendar comparable sale well the impact of fuel for fiscal and were follows fiscal year ended january with fuel fuel impactwalmart sam club total walmart comparable sale increased and in fiscal and respectively driven by ticket and transaction growth walmart ecommerce sale positively contributed approximately and to comparable sale for fiscal and respectively we continue to focus on seamless omni channel experience for our customer sam club comparable sale increased and in fiscal and respectively sam club comparable sale for both fiscal and benefited from growth in transaction and higher fuel sale which were partially offset by lower ticket due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain club location sam club fiscal comparable sale were further aided by transfer of sale from our closed club to our existing club sam club ecommerce sale positively contributed approximately and to comparable sale for fiscal and respectively operating disciplinewe operate with discipline by managing expense optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve we invest in technology and process improvement to increase productivity manage inventory and reduce cost we measure operating discipline through expense leverage which we define net sale growing at faster rate than operating selling general and administrative expense fiscal year ended january amount in million except unit count sale change from comparable period operating selling general and administrative expense change from comparable period operating selling general and administrative expense percentage of net sale for fiscal operating selling general and administrative operating expense percentage of net sale decreased basis point when compared to the previous fiscal year due to our focus on expense management combined with our growth in comparable store sale these improvement were partially offset by billion in business restructuring charge consisting primarily of non cash impairment charge for certain trade name acquired developed technology and other business restructuring charge due to strategic decision that resulted in the write of certain asset in the walmart and walmart international segment for fiscal operating expense percentage of net sale decreased basis point when compared to the previous fiscal year the primary driver of the expense leverage were strong sale performance in conjunction with productivity improvement and lapping of certain fiscal charge the improvement in fiscal were partially offset by additional investment in ecommerce and technology well million charge related to security class action lawsuit strategic capital allocationour strategy includes improving our customer facing initiative in store and club and creating seamless omni channel experience for our customer such we are allocating more capital to ecommerce technology supply chain and store remodels and le to new store and club opening when compared to prior year total fiscal capital expenditure increased slightly compared to the prior year the following table provides additional detail amount in million fiscal year ended january allocation of capital expenditure technology supply chain and other store and club including expansion and relocation international capital expenditure we execute our financial framework we believe our return on capital will improve over time we measure return on capital with our return on asset return on investment and free cash flow metric we also provide return in the form of share repurchase and dividend which are discussed in the liquidity and capital resource section return on asset and return on investment we include return on asset roa the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statement presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle in the gaap and return on investment roi metric to ass return on asset while roi is considered non gaap financial measure management belief roi is meaningful metric to share with investor because it help investor ass how effectively walmart is deploying it asset trend in roi can fluctuate over time management balance long term strategic initiative with possible short term impact roa wa and for fiscal and respectively the increase in roa wa primarily due to the increase in consolidated net income primarily due to the change in fair value of the investment in jd com and lapping the billion net loss recorded in fiscal related to the sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil partially offset by the dilution to operating income related to flipkart roi wa and for fiscal and respectively the decrease in roi wa due to the decrease in operating income primarily result of the dilution from flipkart well business restructuring charge recorded in fiscal the denominator remained relatively flat the increase in average total asset due to the acquisition of flipkart wa offset by the decrease in average invested capital resulting from the removal of the eight time rent factor upon adoption of asu lease asu since operating lease right of use asset are now included in total asset define roi operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing month divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total asset plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization le average account payable and average accrued liability for that period upon adoption of asu rent for the trailing month multiplied by factor of is no longer included in the calculation of roi on prospective basis operating lease asset are now capitalized for fiscal lease related asset and associated accumulated amortization are included in the denominator at their carrying amount of the current balance sheet date rather than averaged because they are no longer directly comparable to the prior year calculation which included rent for the trailing month multiplied by factor of two point average will be used for leased asset beginning in fiscal after one full year from the date of adoption of the new lease standard further beginning prospectively in fiscal rent expense in the numerator excludes short term and variable lease cost these cost are not included in the operating lease right of use asset balance prior to adoption of asu we defined roi operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing month divided by average invested capital during that period we considered average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total asset plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization le average account payable and average accrued liability for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing month multiplied by factor of which estimated the hypothetical capitalization of our operating lease because the new lease standard wa adopted under the modified retrospective approach of february our calculation of roi for fiscal wa not revised our calculation of roi is considered non gaap financial measure because we calculate roi using financial measure that exclude and include amount that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi mentioned above we consider roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle most directly comparable to our calculation of roi roi differs from roa which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total asset for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense item and add interest income and adjusts total asset for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization account payable and accrued liability to arrive at total invested capital because of the adjustment mentioned above we believe roi more accurately measure how we are deploying our key asset and is more meaningful to investor than roa although roi is standard financial measure numerous method exist for calculating company roi result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the method used by other company to calculate their roi the calculation of roa and roi along with reconciliation of roi to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measure is follows fiscal year ended january amount in million of return on assetsnumerator consolidated net income average total asset on asset roa calculation of return on investmentnumerator operating income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income denominator average total asset average accumulated depreciation and amortization average account payable average accrued liability rent invested capital on investment roi of january balance sheet data total asset asset net nptotal asset without leased asset net npaccumulated depreciation and amortization amortization on leased asset npaccumulated depreciation and amortization without leased asset npaccounts payable liability the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the corresponding prior period and dividing by average total asset used in roa includes the average impact of the adoption of asu for fiscal result of adopting asu average total asset is based on the average of total asset without leased asset net plus leased asset net of january average accumulated depreciation and amortization is based on the average of accumulated depreciation and amortization without leased asset plus accumulated amortization on leased asset of january np not provided free cash flowfree cash flow is considered non gaap financial measure management belief however that free cash flow which measure our ability to generate additional cash from our business operation is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than substitute for consolidated net income measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activity measure of our liquidity see liquidity and capital resource for discussion of gaap metric including net cash provided by operating activity net cash used in investing activity and net cash used in financing activity we define free cash flow net cash provided by operating activity in period minus payment for property and equipment made in that period we had net cash provided by operating activity of billion billion and billion for fiscal and respectively we generated free cash flow of billion billion and billion for fiscal and respectively net cash provided by operating activity for fiscal declined when compared to fiscal primarily due to the contribution to our asda pension plan in anticipation of it future settlement the inclusion of full year of flipkart operation and the timing of vendor payment free cash flow for fiscal declined when compared to fiscal due to the same reason the decline in net cash provided by operating activity well billion in increased capital expenditure net cash provided by operating activity for fiscal declined when compared to fiscal wa primarily due to timing of vendor payment partially offset by lower tax payment mainly resulting from the tax act and the timing of tax payment free cash flow for fiscal declined when compared to fiscal due to the same reason the decline in net cash provided by operating activity well billion in increased capital expenditure walmart definition of free cash flow is limited in that it doe not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditure due to the fact that the measure doe not deduct the payment required for debt service and other contractual obligation or payment made for business acquisition therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statement of cash flow although other company report their free cash flow numerous method may exist for calculating company free cash flow result the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the method used by other company to calculate their free cash flow the following table set forth reconciliation of free cash flow non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activity which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow well information regarding net cash used in investing activity and net cash used in financing activity fiscal year ended january amount in million cash provided by operating activity for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in investing activity net cash used in financing activity net cash used in investing activity includes payment for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow of operationsconsolidated result of operation fiscal year ended january amount in million except unit count revenue change

revenue which includes net sale and membership and other income increased billion or and billion or for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year these increase in revenue were due to increase in net sale which increased billion or and billion or for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal net sale were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sale for walmart and sam club segment along with the addition of net sale from flipkart which we acquired in august and positive comparable sale in the majority of our international market these increase were partially offset by billion of negative impact from fluctuation in currency exchange rate in fiscal and our sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil in august for fiscal net sale were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sale for walmart and sam club segment along with positive comparable sale in the majority of our international market and net sale from flipkart which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal additionally for fiscal the increase in net sale wa partially offset by billion decrease in net sale due to club closure in the sam club segment during fiscal billion reduction in net sale due to the sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil in the international segment and billion of negative impact from fluctuation in currency exchange rate our gross profit rate decreased and basis point for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal these decrease were primarily due to price investment in the walmart segment and the addition of flipkart in the walmart international segment partially offset by favorable merchandise mix including strength in private brand and le pressure from transportation cost in the walmart segment for fiscal the decrease wa due to the mix effect from our growing ecommerce business the acquisition of flipkart our planned pricing strategy and increased transportation expense for fiscal operating expense percentage of net sale decreased basis point when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to our focus on expense management combined with our growth in comparable store sale these improvement were partially offset by billion in business restructuring charge consisting primarily of non cash impairment charge for certain trade name acquired developed technology and other business restructuring charge due to strategic decision that resulted in the write down of certain asset in the walmart and walmart international segment for fiscal operating expense percentage of net sale decreased basis point when compared to the previous fiscal year the primary driver of the expense leverage were strong sale performance in conjunction with productivity improvement and lapping approximately billion in certain charge in fiscal the improvement in fiscal were partially offset by additional investment in ecommerce and technology well billion charge related to security class action lawsuit other gain and loss consisted of gain of billion for fiscal and loss of billion for fiscal the gain in fiscal wa primarily the result of billion increase in the market value of our investment in jd com the loss in fiscal is primarily the result of the billion pre tax loss on the sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil and billion decrease in the market value of our investment in jd com fiscal result included loss on extinguishment of debt of billion effective income tax rate wa for fiscal for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal is primarily due to the fiscal loss on sale of majority stake in walmart brazil which increased the comparative period effective tax rate it provided minimal realizable tax benefit the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal is primarily due to the aforementioned loss on sale of majority stake in walmart brazil and flipkart result additionally our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate result of various factor including change in our assessment of certain tax contingency valuation allowance change in tax law outcome of administrative audit the impact of discrete item and the mix and size of earnings among our operation and international operation which are subject to statutory rate that beginning in fiscal are generally higher than the statutory rate the reconciliation from the statutory rate to the effective income tax rate for fiscal and is presented in note to our note to consolidated financial statement result of the factor discussed above we reported billion and billion of consolidated net income for fiscal and respectively which represents an increase of billion and decrease of billion for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year diluted net income per common share attributable to walmart eps wa and for fiscal and respectively walmart segment fiscal year ended january amount in million except unit count sale change from comparable period calendar comparable sale increase operating income income percentage of net sale unit count at period end square foot at period end sale for the walmart segment increased billion or and billion or for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year the increase in net sale were primarily due to increase in comparable store sale of and for fiscal and respectively driven by ticket and transaction growth walmart ecommerce sale positively contributed approximately and to comparable sale for fiscal and gross profit rate decreased and basis point for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal the decrease were primarily the result of continued price investment which were partially offset by better merchandise mix including strength in private brand and le pressure from transportation cost for fiscal the decrease wa primarily due to our planned pricing strategy increased transportation expense and the mix effect from our growing ecommerce business operating expense percentage of segment net sale decreased basis point for fiscal and decreased basis point for fiscal when compared to the previous fiscal year we leveraged operating expense in fiscal result of strong sale and productivity improvement which were mostly offset by business restructuring charge of billion consisting primarily of non cash impairment charge for certain trade name acquired developed technology and other business restructuring charge due to decision that resulted in the write down of certain ecommerce asset the decrease in fiscal wa primarily due to strong sale performance in conjunction with productivity improvement and the prior year comparable period including charge related to discontinued real estate project of billion these improvement more than offset investment in ecommerce technology and omni channel initiative and raising the starting wage rate at the beginning of fiscal result of the factor discussed above segment operating income decreased million and increased million for fiscal and respectively when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year international segment fiscal year ended january amount in million except unit count sale change from comparable period operating income income percentage of net sale unit count at period end square foot at period end sale for the walmart international segment decreased billion or and increased billion or for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal the decrease wa primarily due to negative fluctuation in currency exchange rate of billion well reduction in sale due to our sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil in august offset by full year of net sale from flipkart and positive comparable sale growth in the majority of our market for fiscal the increase wa primarily due to positive comparable sale in the majority of our market and net sale from flipkart which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal these increase were partially offset by billion reduction in net sale due to our sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil billion negative impact from fluctuation in currency exchange rate the continued wind down of our first party brazil ecommerce operation and reduction in net sale of million due to divesting our suburbia business in the second quarter of fiscal gross profit rate decreased and basis point for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal the decrease wa primarily due to flipkart well change in merchandise mix for fiscal the decrease wa due to flipkart and strategic price investment in certain market membership and other income decreased and for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year the decrease in fiscal wa primarily due to currency while fiscal decreased due to the prior year recognition of million gain from the sale of suburbia operating expense percentage of segment net sale decreased basis point for fiscal and basis point for when compared to the previous fiscal year the decrease in operating expense percentage of segment net sale for fiscal wa primarily due to positive comparable sale in the majority of our market and cost discipline across multiple market partially offset by billion in impairment charge which wa due primarily to the write off of the carrying value of one of flipkart two fashion trade name jabong com result of strategic decision to focus our effort on single fashion platform in order to simplify the business and customer proposition fiscal decreased primarily due to impairment charge in the previous fiscal year of approximately billion which included charge from decision to exit certain property and wind down the first party brazil ecommerce operation this decrease in operating expense wa partially offset by the addition of operating expense from flipkart in fiscal result of the factor discussed above segment operating income decreased billion and billion for fiscal and respectively sam club segment fiscal year ended january amount in million except unit count fuel net sale change from comparable period calendar comparable sale increase operating income income percentage of net sale unit count at period end square foot at period end excluding fuel net sale change from comparable period operating income income percentage of net sale we believe the excluding fuel information is useful to investor because it permit investor to understand the effect of the sam club segment fuel sale on it result of operation which are impacted by the volatility of fuel price volatility in fuel price may continue to impact the operating result of the sam club segment in the future management us such information to better measure underlying operating result in the segment sale for the sam club segment increased billion or for fiscal and decreased billion or for fiscal when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal the increase were primarily due to comparable sale including fuel of comparable sale benefited from growth in transaction and higher fuel sale which were partially offset by lower ticket due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain club location sam club ecommerce sale positively contributed approximately to comparable sale for fiscal the decrease wa primarily due to billion decrease in net sale resulting from the net closure of club during fiscal well reduced tobacco sale due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain location these decrease were partially offset by increase in comparable sale which were benefited by transfer of sale from our closed club to our existing club sam club ecommerce sale positively contributed approximately to comparable sale for fiscal additional fuel sale of billion partially offset the decrease in net sale for fiscal gross profit rate decreased basis point for fiscal and remained relatively flat for fiscal when compared to the previous fiscal year the gross profit rate decreased due to investment in price and higher ecommerce fulfillment cost partially offset by reduced tobacco sale which have lower margin for fiscal gross profit rate wa benefited by lapping the impact of markdowns to liquidate inventory related to club closure in fiscal and decreased tobacco sale in fiscal this benefit to the gross profit rate wa offset by higher transportation cost and ecommerce shipping cost investment in price and increased shrink in fiscal membership and other income increased and for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal the increase wa primarily due to growth in total member which benefited from higher overall renewal rate and higher plus member penetration along with gain on property sale and other income for fiscal the increase wa due to an increase of in membership income resulting from increased plus member penetration and gain on property sale these increase were partially offset by lower recycling income when compared to the previous fiscal year operating expense percentage of segment net sale decreased and basis point for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal the decrease wa primarily the result of lower labor related cost and charge of approximately million related to lease exit cost in the prior comparable period these benefit were partially offset by reduction in sale of tobacco and higher level of technology investment for fiscal the decrease in operating expense percentage of segment net sale wa primarily due to charge of approximately billion in the prior year comparable period related to

billion of january and respectively our working capital deficit defined total current asset le total current liability wa billion and billion of january and respectively we generally operate with working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operation consistent access to the capital market and return provided to our shareholder in the form of payment of cash dividend and share repurchase use intercompany financing arrangement in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible additionally from time to time we repatriate earnings and related cash from jurisdiction outside of the historically tax were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings due to the enactment of tax reform repatriation of foreign earnings will generally be free of federal tax but may incur other tax such withholding or state tax while we are awaiting anticipated technical guidance from the irs and the treasury department we do

disclosure rule are complex and require to use technical terminology in preparing the company consolidated financial statement we follow accounting principle generally accepted in the these principle require to make certain estimate and apply judgment that affect our financial position and result of operation reflected in our financial statement these judgment and estimate are based on past event and expectation of future outcome actual result may differ from our estimate management continually review our accounting policy how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statement following is summary of our critical accounting estimate and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statement inventorieswe value inventory at the lower of cost or market determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting using the last in first lifo method for walmart segment inventory the inventory at the sam club segment is valued using the weighted average cost lifo method when necessary we record lifo provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation and these estimate are adjusted to actual result determined at year end our lifo provision is calculated based on inventory level markup rate and internally generated retail price index measure of sensitivity increase to our retail price index would not have resulted in decrease to the carrying value of inventory of january and our inventory valued at lifo approximated those inventory if they were valued at fifo impairment of assetswe evaluate long lived asset for indicator of impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable management judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicator are based on market condition and financial performance the evaluation of long lived asset is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flow which is generally at the individual store level the variability of these factor depends on number of condition including uncertainty about future event and change in demographic thus our accounting estimate may change from period to period these factor could cause management to conclude that indicator of impairment exist and require impairment test be performed which could result in management determining the value of long lived asset is impaired resulting in write down of the related long lived asset impairment charge recorded in fiscal were measure of sensitivity fiscal impairment would not change materially with decrease in the undiscounted cash flow for the store or club with indicator of impairment while fiscal included pre tax loss of billion related to the sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil which included full impairment of all related asset there were no other material impairment charge for fiscal business combination goodwill and acquired intangible assetswe account for business combination using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control is obtained all the asset acquired and liability assumed including amount attributable to noncontrolling interest are recorded at their respective fair value at the date of acquisition the determination of fair value of identifiable asset and liability requires estimate and the use of valuation technique when market value is not readily available for intangible asset acquired in business combination we typically use the income method significant estimate in valuing certain intangible asset include but are not limited to the amount and timing of future cash flow growth rate discount rate and useful life the excess of the purchase price over fair value of identifiable asset and liability is recorded goodwill goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition component within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed single reporting unit if the component have similar economic characteristic of january our reporting unit consisted of walmart walmart international and sam club goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible asset are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the value of certain asset may be impaired generally this evaluation begin with qualitative assessment to determine whether quantitative impairment test is necessary if we determine after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factor that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not le than the carrying amount or that fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount can not be assured then quantitative impairment test would be performed the quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgment relating to future cash flow growth rate and economic and market condition these evaluation are based on determining the fair value of reporting unit or asset using valuation method such discounted cash flow or relative market based approach historically our reporting unit have generated sufficient return to recover the cost of goodwill the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value our indefinite lived acquired intangible asset have also historically generated sufficient return to recover their cost however due to certain strategic restructuring decision in fiscal we recorded approximately billion in impairment related to acquired trade name and acquired developed software because of the nature of the factor used in these test if different condition occur in future period future operating result could be materially impacted contingencieswe are involved in number of legal proceeding we record liability when it is probable that loss ha been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable we also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingency where loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that loss could be incurred in excess of amount accrued if loss or an additional loss ha at least reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statement would be material we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnote to our financial statement we review all contingency at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss ha changed and to ass whether reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made although we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate range of possible loss in certain matter described in note in the note to our consolidated financial statement and have not recorded an associated accrual related to these matter an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matter could have material adverse effect on our business financial position result of operation or cash flow income taxesincome tax have significant effect on our net earnings we are subject to income tax in the and numerous foreign jurisdiction accordingly the determination of our provision for income tax requires judgment the use of estimate in certain case and the interpretation and application of complex tax law our effective income tax rate is affected by many factor including change in our assessment of certain tax contingency increase and decrease in valuation allowance change in tax law outcome of administrative audit the impact of discrete item and the mix of earnings among our and international operation where the statutory rate are generally higher than the statutory rate and may fluctuate result our tax return are routinely audited and settlement of issue raised in these audit sometimes affect our tax provision the benefit of uncertain tax position are recorded in our financial statement only after determining more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax position will withstand challenge if any from taxing authority when fact and circumstance change we reassess these probability and record any change in the financial statement appropriate we account for uncertain tax position by determining the minimum recognition threshold that tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statement this determination requires the use of judgment in evaluating our tax position and assessing the timing and amount of deductible and taxable item deferred tax asset represent amount available to reduce income tax payable on taxable income in future year such asset arise because of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability well from net loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax asset are evaluated for future realization and reduced by valuation allowance to the extent that portion is not more likely than not to be realized many factor are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized including recent cumulative earnings expectation of future taxable income carryforward period and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factor the recoverability of the deferred tax asset is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategy this evaluation relies on estimate on december the tax cut and job act of the tax act wa enacted and contains significant change to income tax law effective beginning january the tax
