estimate information regarding significant accounting policy is included in note of the consolidated financial statement stated in note the preparation of financial statement requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent asset and liability management base it estimate on historical experience and on various assumption that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily apparent from other source actual result may differ from these estimate the company belief it most critical accounting estimate relate to legal proceeding the company pension and

postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plan in accordance with accounting standard codification asc compensation retirement benefit in measuring plan asset and benefit obligation and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost asc requires employer to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of defined benefit pension or postretirement plan an asset or liability in it statement of financial position and recognize change in the funded status in the year in which the change occur through accumulated other comprehensive income which is component of stockholder equity while the company belief the valuation method used to determine the fair value of plan asset are table of content appropriate and consistent with other market participant the use of different methodology or assumption to determine the fair value of certain financial instrument could result in different estimate of fair value at the reporting date see note for additional discussion of actuarial assumption used in determining defined benefit pension and postretirement health care liability and expense pension benefit associated with these plan are generally based primarily on each participant year of service compensation and age at retirement or termination the benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefit that employee are entitled to in the future for service already rendered of the measurement date the company measure the present value of these future benefit by projecting benefit payment cash flow for each future period and discounting these cash flow back to the december measurement date using the yield of portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instrument that would produce cash flow sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefit service cost and interest cost are measured separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation service cost are determined based on duration specific spot rate applied to the service cost cash flow the interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration specific spot rate to the year by year projected benefit payment the spot yield curve approach doe not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation the change in service and interest cost offset in the actuarial gain and loss recorded in other comprehensive income using this methodology the company determined discount rate for it plan follow qualified pension international pension weighted average postretirement medical december liability benefit obligation net periodic benefit cost component service cost interest cost another significant element in determining the company pension expense in accordance with asc is the expected return on plan asset which is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan long term capital market return expectation and expected performance from active investment management for the primary qualified pension plan the expected long term rate of return on an annualized basis for is decrease from in refer to note for information on the rate wa determined return on asset assumption for international pension and other post

all other factor are held constant including the slope of the discount rate yield curve increase decrease in net periodic benefit cost discount rate expected return on asset million pension plan international pension plan table of content asset impairment of december net property plant and equipment totaled billion and net identifiable intangible asset totaled billion management make estimate and assumption in preparing the consolidated financial statement for which actual result will emerge over long period of time this includes the recoverability of long lived asset employed in the business including asset of acquired business these estimate and assumption are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted circumstance warrant for instance expected asset life may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group of the billion in net identifiable intangible asset billion relates to indefinite lived tradenames primarily capital safety whose tradenames million at acquisition date have been in existence for over year refer to note for more detail the primary valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible asset tradenames is discounted cash flow approach specifically relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sale with the resulting amount discounted using an appropriate market technology discount rate the relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate market participant would pay to acquire the right to market produce the product if the resulting discounted cash flow are le than the book value of the indefinite lived intangible asset impairment exists and the asset value must be written down based on impairment testing in the third quarter of no impairment wa indicated the discounted cash flow related to the capital safety tradenames exceeded it book value by more than percent in aggregate goodwill totaled approximately billion of december annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year impairment testing for goodwill is done at reporting unit level with all goodwill assigned to reporting unit reporting unit are one level below the business segment level but are required to be combined when reporting unit within the same segment have similar economic characteristic at reporting unit correspond to division did not combine any of it reporting unit for impairment testing an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit net asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the loss would equal that difference the estimated fair value of reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by price earnings ratio for comparable industry group or by using discounted cash flow analysis typically us the price earnings ratio approach for stable and growing business that have long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flow us the discounted cash flow approach for start up loss position and declining business in addition to using for business where the price earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted also us discounted cash flow an additional tool for business that may be growing at slower rate than planned due to economic or other condition described in note effective in the first quarter of made business segment reporting change for any product move that resulted in reporting unit change the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting unit during the first quarter of the company completed it assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting unit impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed the discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time of october had primary reporting unit with ten reporting unit accounting for approximately percent of the goodwill these ten reporting unit were comprised of the following division advanced material display material and system electronics material solution health information system industrial adhesive and tape infection prevention oral care solution personal safety separation and purification and transportation safety the estimated fair value for all reporting unit wa in excess of carrying value by approximately percent or more market value at both december and september wa significantly in excess of it shareholder equity of approximately billion discussed in note sold it communication market division in which comprised substantially all of the million reduction in goodwill associated with divestiture during in determined fair value using either an industry price earnings ratio approach or discounted cash flow analysis where applicable used weighted average discounted cash flow analysis for certain division using projected cash flow that were table of content weighted based on different sale growth and terminal value assumption among other factor the weighting wa based on management estimate of the likelihood of each scenario occurring is highly integrated enterprise where business share technology and leverage common fundamental strength and capability thus many of business could not easily be sold on stand alone basis focus on research and development ha resulted in portion of value comprised of internally developed business that have no goodwill associated with them based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of no goodwill impairment wa indicated for any of the reporting unit factor which could result in future impairment charge include among others change in worldwide economic condition change in competitive condition and customer preference and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate these risk factor are discussed in item risk factor of this document in addition change in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing result indicated above during the first quarter of the company completed it assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting unit impacted by change between reporting unit and determined that no impairment existed long lived asset with definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset asset group may not be recoverable if future non cash asset impairment charge are taken would expect that only portion of the long lived asset or goodwill would be impaired will continue to monitor it reporting unit and asset group in for any triggering event or other indicator of impairment income tax the extent of operation involves dealing with uncertainty and judgment in the application of complex tax regulation in multitude of jurisdiction the final tax paid are dependent upon many factor including negotiation with taxing authority in various jurisdiction and resolution of dispute arising from federal state and international tax audit the company recognizes potential liability and record tax liability for anticipated tax audit issue in the united state and other tax jurisdiction based on it estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax will be due the company follows guidance provided by asc income tax regarding uncertainty in income tax to record these liability refer to note for

payment that is materially different from the company current estimate of the tax liability if the company estimate of tax liability prof to be le than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amount ultimately prof to be le than the recorded amount the reversal of the liability would result in tax benefit being recognized in the period when the

disclosure with respect to asset and liability that are measured at fair value on recurring basis and nonrecurring basis under the standard fair value is defined the exit price or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant of the measurement date the standard also establishes hierarchy for input used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable input and minimizes the use of unobservable input by requiring that the most observable input be used when available observable input are input market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from source independent of the company unobservable input are input that reflect the company assumption about the factor market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstance the hierarchy is broken down into three level level input are quoted price unadjusted in active market for identical asset or liability level input include quoted price for similar asset or liability in active market quoted price for identical or similar asset or liability in market that are not active and input other than quoted price that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level input are unobservable input for the asset or liability categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement asset and

or future charge if any would not have material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the company based on experience and development the company reexamines it estimate of probable liability and associated expense and receivables each period and whether it is able to estimate liability previously determined to be not estimable and or not probable where appropriate the company make addition to or adjustment of it estimated liability result the current estimate of the potential impact on the company consolidated financial position result of operation and cash flow for the legal proceeding and claim pending against the company could change in the future table of content the following section first describe the significant legal proceeding in which the company is involved and then describe the liability and associated insurance receivables the company ha accrued relating to it significant legal proceeding respirator mask asbestos litigation of december the company is named defendant with multiple co defendant in numerous lawsuit in various court that purport to represent approximately individual claimant compared to approximately individual claimant with action pending at december the vast majority of the lawsuit and claim resolved by and currently pending against the company allege use of some of the company mask and respirator product and seek damage from the company and other defendant for alleged personal injury from workplace exposure to asbestos silica coal mine dust or other occupational dust found in product manufactured by other defendant or generally in the workplace minority of the lawsuit and claim resolved by and currently pending against the company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from product previously manufactured by the company which are often unspecified well product manufactured by other defendant or occasionally at company premise the company current volume of new and pending matter is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filing in the company expects that filing of claim by unimpaired claimant in the future will continue to be at much lower level than in the past accordingly the number of claim alleging more serious injury including mesothelioma other malignancy and black lung disease will represent greater percentage of total claim than in the past over the past twenty year the company ha prevailed in fourteen of the fifteen case tried to jury including the lawsuit in described below in received jury verdict in it favor in two lawsuit one in california state court in february and the other in massachusetts state court in december both involving allegation that respirator were defective and failed to protect the plaintiff against asbestos fiber in april jury in state court in kentucky found respirator failed to protect two coal miner from coal mine dust and awarded compensatory damage of approximately million and punitive damage totaling million in august the trial court entered judgment and the company ha appealed the company belief liability in this case is not probable and estimable in june the company also settled number of coal mine dust lawsuit for an amount that wa not material to the company the company ha demonstrated in these past trial proceeding that it respiratory protection product are effective claimed when used in the intended manner and in the intended circumstance consequently the company belief that claimant are unable to establish that their medical condition even if significant are attributable to the company respiratory protection product nonetheless the company litigation experience indicates that claim of person alleging more serious injury including mesothelioma other malignancy and black lung disease are costlier to resolve than the claim of unimpaired person and it therefore belief the average cost of resolving pending and future claim on per claim basis will continue to be higher than it experienced in prior period when the vast majority of claim were asserted by medically unimpaired claimant previously reported the state of west virginia through it attorney general filed complaint in against the company and two other manufacturer of respiratory protection product in the circuit court of lincoln county west virginia and amended it complaint in the amended complaint seek substantial but unspecified compensatory damage primarily for reimbursement of the cost allegedly incurred by the state for worker compensation and healthcare benefit provided to all worker with occupational pneumoconiosis and unspecified punitive damage the case wa inactive from the fourth quarter of until late other than case management conference in march in november the state filed motion to bifurcate the lawsuit into separate liability and damage proceeding at the hearing on the motion the court declined to bifurcate the lawsuit no liability ha been recorded for this matter because the company belief that liability is not probable and estimable at this time in addition the company is not able to estimate possible loss or range of loss given the lack of any meaningful discovery response by the state of west virginia the otherwise minimal activity in this case and the fact that the complaint asserts claim against two other manufacturer where defendant share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability and by the amount of fault if any jury might allocate to each defendant if the case is ultimately tried respirator mask asbestos liability and insurance receivables the company regularly conduct comprehensive legal review of it respirator mask asbestos liability the company review recent and historical claim data including without limitation the number of pending claim filed against the company ii the table of content nature and mix of those claim the proportion of claim asserting usage of the company mask or respirator product and alleging exposure to each of asbestos silica coal or other occupational dust and claim pleading use of asbestos containing product allegedly manufactured by the company iii the cost to defend and resolve pending claim and iv trend in filing rate and in cost to defend and resolve claim collectively the claim data part of it comprehensive legal review the company regularly provides the claim data to third party with expertise in determining the impact of claim data on future filing trend and cost the third party assist the company in estimating the cost to defend and resolve pending and future claim the company us these estimate to develop it best estimate of probable liability development may occur that could affect the company estimate of it liability these development include but are not limited to significant change in the key assumption underlying the company accrual including the number of future claim the nature and mix of those claim the average cost of defending and resolving claim and in maintaining trial readiness ii trial and appellate outcome iii the law and procedure applicable to these claim and iv the financial viability of other co defendant and insurer result of the company review of it respirator mask asbestos liability and result of the cost of resolving claim of person who claim more serious injury including mesothelioma other malignancy and black lung disease the company increased it accrual in for respirator mask asbestos liability by million in the company made payment for legal fee and settlement of million related to the respirator mask asbestos litigation of december the company had an accrual for respirator mask asbestos liability excluding aearo accrual of million up million from the accrual at december this accrual represents the company best estimate of probable loss and reflects an estimation period for future claim that may be filed against the company approaching the year the company can not estimate the amount or upper end of the range of amount by which the liability may exceed the accrual the company ha established because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claim that have not yet been asserted or the time period in which future claim may be asserted ii the complaint nearly always assert claim against multiple defendant where the damage alleged are typically not attributed to individual defendant so that defendant share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability which can vary by state iii the multiple factor described above that the company considers in estimating it liability and iv the several possible development described above that may occur that could affect the company estimate of liability of december the company receivable for insurance recovery related to the respirator mask asbestos litigation wa million the company continues to seek coverage under the policy of certain insolvent and other insurer those claim for coverage are resolved the company will have collected substantially all of it remaining insurance coverage for respirator mask asbestos claim respirator mask asbestos litigation aearo technology on april subsidiary of the company purchased the stock of aearo holding corp the parent of aearo technology aearo aearo manufactured and sold various product including personal protection equipment such eye ear head face fall and certain respiratory protection product of december aearo and or other company that previously owned and operated aearo respirator business american optical corporation warner lambert llc ao corp and cabot corporation cabot are named defendant with multiple co defendant including the company in numerous lawsuit in various court in which plaintiff allege use of mask and respirator product and seek damage from aearo and other defendant for alleged personal injury from workplace exposure to asbestos silica related coal mine dust or other occupational dust found in product manufactured by other defendant or generally in the workplace of december the company through it aearo subsidiary had accrual of million for product liability and defense cost related to current and future aearo related asbestos and silica related claim this accrual represents the company best estimate of aearo probable loss and reflects an estimation period for future claim that may be filed against aearo approaching the year responsibility for legal cost well for settlement and judgment is currently shared in an informal arrangement among aearo cabot american optical corporation and subsidiary of warner lambert and their respective insurer the payor group liability is allocated among the party based on the number of year each company sold respiratory product under the ao safety brand and or owned the ao safety division of american optical corporation and the alleged year of exposure of the individual plaintiff aearo share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement entered into between aearo and cabot on july this agreement provides that so long aearo pay to cabot quarterly fee of cabot will retain responsibility and liability for and indemnify aearo against any product liability claim involving exposure to asbestos silica or table of content silica product for respirator sold prior to july because of the difficulty in determining how long particular respirator remains in the stream of commerce after being sold aearo and cabot have applied the agreement to claim arising out of the alleged use of respirator involving exposure to asbestos silica or silica product prior to january with these arrangement in place aearo potential liability is limited to exposure alleged to have arisen from the use of respirator involving exposure to asbestos silica or silica product on or after january to date aearo ha elected to pay the quarterly fee aearo could potentially be exposed to additional claim for some part of the pre july period covered by it agreement with cabot if aearo elect to discontinue it participation in this arrangement or if cabot is no longer able to meet it obligation in these matter development may occur that could affect the estimate of aearo liability these development include but are not limited to significant change in the number of future claim ii significant change in the average cost of resolving claim iii significant change in the legal cost of defending these claim iv significant change in the mix and nature of claim received trial and appellate outcome vi significant change in the law and procedure applicable to these claim vii significant change in the liability allocation among the co defendant viii the financial viability of member of the payor group including exhaustion of available insurance coverage limit and or ix determination that the interpretation of the contractual obligation on which aearo ha estimated it share of liability is inaccurate the company can not determine the impact of these potential development on it current estimate of aearo share of liability for these existing and future claim if any of the development described above were to occur the actual amount of these liability for existing and future claim could be significantly larger than the amount accrued because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claim that have not yet been asserted the complexity of allocating responsibility for future claim among the payor group and the several possible development that may occur that could affect the estimate of aearo liability the company can not estimate the amount or range of amount by which aearo liability may exceed the accrual the company ha established environmental matter and litigation the company operation are subject to environmental law and regulation including those pertaining to air emission wastewater discharge toxic substance and the handling and disposal of solid
