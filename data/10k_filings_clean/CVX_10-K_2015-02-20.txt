between saudi arabia and kuwait the philippine republic of the congo singapore south africa south korea thailand trinidad and tobago the united kingdom the united state venezuela and vietnam earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of it upstream business segment the biggest factor affecting the result of operation for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil the price of crude oil ha fallen significantly since mid year reflecting robust non opec supply growth led by expanding unconventional production in the united state weakening growth in emerging market and the decision by opec in fourth quarter to maintain it current production ceiling the downturn in the price of crude oil ha impacted and depending upon it duration will continue to significantly impact the company result of operation cash flow capital and exploratory investment program and production outlook if lower price persist for an extended period of time the company response could include further reduction in operating expense and capital and exploratory expenditure and additional asset sale the company anticipates that crude oil price will increase in the future continued growth in demand and slowing in supply growth should bring global market into balance however the timing of any such increase is unknown in the company downstream business crude oil is the largest cost component of refined product refer to the cautionary statement relevant to forward looking information on page and to risk factor in part item on page through for discussion of some of the inherent risk that could materially impact the company result of operation or financial condition the company continually evaluates opportunity to dispose of asset that are not expected to provide sufficient long term value or to acquire asset or operation complementary to it asset base to help augment the company financial performance and growth refer to the result of operation section beginning on page for discussion of net gain on asset sale during asset disposition and restructurings may also occur in future period and could result in significant gain or loss discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operationsthe company closely monitor development in the financial and credit market the level of worldwide economic activity and the implication for the company of change in price for crude oil and natural gas management take these development into account in the conduct of ongoing operation and for business planning comment related to earnings trend for the company major business area are follows upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry price for crude oil and natural gas crude oil and natural gas price are subject to external factor over which the company ha no control including product demand connected with global economic condition industry inventory level production quota or other action imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting country opec weather related damage and disruption competing fuel price and regional supply interruption or fear thereof that may be caused by military conflict civil unrest or political uncertainty any of these factor could also inhibit the company production capacity in an affected region the company closely monitor development in the country in which it operates and hold investment and seek to manage risk in operating it facility and business the longer term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also function of other factor including the company ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas change in fiscal term of contract and change in tax law and regulation the company continues to actively manage it schedule of work contracting procurement and supply chain activity to effectively manage cost however price level for capital and exploratory cost and operating expense associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factor beyond the company control including among other thing the general level of inflation commodity price and price charged by the industry material and service provider which can be affected by the volatility of the industry own supply and demand condition for such material and service in recent year chevron and the oil and gas industry generally experienced an increase in certain cost that exceeded the general trend of inflation in many area of the world result of the decline in price of crude oil and other commodity in these cost pressure are beginning to soften capital and exploratory expenditure and operating expense can also be affected by damage to production facility caused by severe weather or civil unrest the chart above show the trend in benchmark price for brent crude oil west texas intermediate wti crude oil and henry hub natural gas the brent price averaged per barrel for the full year compared to in of mid february the brent price wa per barrel the majority of the company equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark while geopolitical tension and supply disruption supported crude price through mid year crude price have since been in decline sign of crude oil over supply emerged during the second half of the year due to continued robust non opec supply growth concern over softness in the global economic recovery and material easing of geopolitical tension and supply disruption downward pressure on crude pricing ha been further magnified by opec decision in november to maintain the current production ceiling of million barrel per day despite evidence of market surplus the wti price averaged per barrel for the full year compared to in of mid february the wti price wa per barrel wti traded at discount to brent throughout due to high inventory and excess crude supply in the market discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operationsa differential in crude oil price exists between high quality high gravity low sulfur crude and those of lower quality low gravity high sulfur the amount of the differential in any period is associated with the supply of heavy crude versus the demand which is function of the capacity of refinery that are able to process this lower quality feedstock into light product motor gasoline jet fuel aviation gasoline and diesel fuel after peaking early in second quarter the differential ha eased in north america refinery crude run remained at or above record level outside of north america easing of geopolitical tension and continued expansion of supply of light sweet crude ha pressured light sweet crude price relative to those for heavier more sour crude chevron produce or share in the production of heavy crude oil in california indonesia the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait venezuela and in certain field in angola china and the united kingdom sector of the north sea see page for the company average and international crude oil realization in contrast to price movement in the global market for crude oil price change for natural gas in many regional market are more closely aligned with supply and demand condition in those market fluctuation in the price of natural gas in the united state are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volume produced and stored in north america in the united state price at henry hub averaged per thousand cubic foot mcf during compared with during of mid february the henry hub spot price wa per mcf outside the united state price change for natural gas depend on wide range of supply demand regulatory and commercial factor in some location chevron is investing in long term project to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other market the company contract price for liquefied natural gas lng are typically linked to crude oil price chevron international natural gas realization averaged per mcf during compared with per mcf during see page for the company average natural gas realization for the and international region the company worldwide net oil equivalent production in averaged million million barrel per day about one fifth of the company net oil equivalent production in occurred in the opec member country of angola nigeria venezuela and the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait opec quota had no effect on the company net crude oil production in or at their november meeting member of opec supported maintaining the current production quota of million barrel per day which ha been in effect since december the company estimate that oil equivalent production in will be flat to percent growth compared to this estimate is subject to many factor and uncertainty including the duration of the low price environment that began in second half quota that may be imposed by opec price effect on entitlement volume change in fiscal term or restriction on the scope of company operation delay in construction start up or ramp up of project fluctuation in demand for natural gas in various market weather condition that may shut in production civil unrest changing geopolitics delay in completion of maintenance turnaround greater than expected decline in production from mature discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operationsfields or other disruption to operation the outlook for future production level is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunity and for new large scale project the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production investment in upstream project generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production significant majority of chevron upstream investment is made outside the united state net proved reserve for consolidated company and affiliated company totaled billion barrel of oil equivalent at year end decrease of percent from year end the reserve replacement ratio in wa percent refer to table beginning on page for tabulation of the company proved net oil and gas reserve by geographic area at the beginning of and each year end from through and an accompanying discussion of major change to proved reserve by geographic area for the three year period ending december on november while drilling development well in the deepwater frade field about mile offshore brazil an unanticipated pressure spike caused oil to migrate from the well bore through series of fissure to the sea floor emitting approximately barrel of

of any coastal or wildlife impact related to either of these seeps have emerged reported in the company previously filed periodic report it ha resolved civil claim relating to these incident brought by brazilian federal district prosecutor also reported previously the federal district prosecutor also filed criminal charge against chevron and eleven chevron employee on february the trial court

notification to authority on february chevron filed motion for reconsideration while reconsideration of the motion to dismiss is pending there will be further proceeding on the reinstated allegation the company ultimate exposure related to the incident is not currently determinable refer to the result of operation section on page through for additional discussion of the company upstream business downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margin on the refining manufacturing and marketing of product that include gasoline diesel jet fuel lubricant fuel oil fuel and lubricant additive and petrochemical industry margin are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply and demand balance for refined product and petrochemical and by change in the price of crude oil other refinery and petrochemical feedstock and natural gas industry margin can also be influenced by inventory level geopolitical event cost of material and service refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization maintenance program and disruption at refinery or chemical plant resulting from unplanned outage due to severe weather fire or other operational event other factor affecting profitability for downstream operation include the reliability and efficiency of the company refining marketing and petrochemical asset the effectiveness of it crude oil and product supply function and the volatility of tanker charter rate for the company shipping operation which are driven by the industry demand for crude oil and product tanker other factor beyond the company control include the general level of inflation and energy cost to operate the company refining marketing and petrochemical asset the company most significant marketing area are the west coast of north

assumption in the application of generally accepted accounting principle gaap that may have material impact on the company consolidated financial statement and related disclosure and on the comparability of such information over different reporting period such estimate and assumption affect reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense well disclosure of contingent asset and liability estimate and assumption are based on management experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statement materially different result can occur circumstance change and additional information becomes known the discussion in this section of critical accounting estimate and assumption is according to the disclosure guideline of the security and exchange commission sec wherein the nature of the estimate and assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matter or the susceptibility of such matter to change the impact of the estimate and assumption on the company financial condition or operating performance is material the development and selection of accounting estimate and assumption including those deemed critical and the associated disclosure in this discussion have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of director the area of accounting and the associated critical estimate and assumption made by the company are follows oil and gas reserve crude oil and natural gas reserve are estimate of future production that impact certain asset and expense account included in the consolidated financial statement proved reserve are the estimated quantity of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic condition operating method and government regulation proved reserve include both developed and undeveloped volume proved developed reserve represent volume expected to be recovered through existing well with existing equipment and operating method proved undeveloped reserve are volume expected to be recovered from new well on undrilled proved acreage or from existing well where relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion variable impacting chevron estimated volume of crude oil and natural gas reserve include field performance available technology commodity price and development and production cost the estimate of crude oil and natural gas reserve are important to the timing of expense recognition for cost incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing asset impact of oil and gas reserve on chevron consolidated financial statement using the successful effort method of accounting include the following amortization capitalized exploratory drilling and development cost are depreciated on unit of production uop basis using proved developed reserve acquisition cost of proved property are amortized on uop basis using total proved reserve during chevron uop depreciation depletion and amortization dd for oil and gas property wa billion and proved developed reserve at the beginning of were billion barrel for consolidated company if the estimate of proved reserve used in the uop calculation for consolidated operation had been lower by percent across all oil and gas property uop dd in would have increased by approximately million discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of impairment oil and gas reserve are used in assessing oil and gas producing property for impairment significant reduction in the estimated reserve of property would trigger an impairment review in assessing whether the property is impaired the fair value of the property must be determined frequently discounted cash flow methodology is the best estimate of fair value proved reserve and in some case portion of unproved resource are used to estimate future production volume in the cash flow model for further discussion of estimate and assumption used in impairment assessment see impairment of property plant and equipment and investment in affiliate below refer to table reserve quantity information beginning on page for the change in proved reserve estimate for the three year ending december and to table vii change in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow from proved reserve on page for estimate of proved reserve value for each of the three year ended december this oil and gas reserve commentary should be read in conjunction with the property plant and equipment section of note to the consolidated financial statement beginning on page which includes description of the successful effort method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activity impairment of property plant and equipment and investment in affiliate the company ass it property plant and equipment pp for possible impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flow expected from the asset an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over it estimated fair value determination to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimate on highly uncertain matter such future commodity price the effect of inflation and technology improvement on operating expense production profile and the outlook for global or regional market supply and demand condition for crude oil natural gas commodity chemical and refined product however the impairment review and calculation are based on assumption that are consistent with the company business plan and long term investment decision refer also to the discussion of impairment of property plant and equipment in note beginning on page and to the section on property plant and equipment in note summary of significant accounting policy beginning on page the company routinely performs impairment review when triggering event arise to determine whether any write down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required for example when significant downward revision to crude oil and natural gas reserve are made for any single field or concession an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable similarly significant downward revision in the company crude oil or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment review for impacted upstream asset also if the expectation of sale of particular asset or asset group in any period ha been deemed more likely than not an impairment review is performed and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group no impairment charge is required such calculation are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed of asset that are not impaired on held and used basis could possibly become impaired if decision is made to sell such asset that is the asset would be impaired if they are classified held for sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale le cost to sell are le than the asset associated carrying value investment in common stock of affiliate that are accounted for under the equity method well investment in other security of these equity investees are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment fall below the company carrying value differing assumption could affect whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment and are not subject to sensitivity analysis no material individual impairment of pp or investment were recorded for the three year ending december sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these period if other assumption had been used in impairment review and impairment calculation is not practicable given the broad range of the company pp and the number of assumption involved in the estimate that is favorable change to some assumption might have avoided the need to impair any asset in these period whereas unfavorable change might have caused an additional unknown number of other asset to become impaired asset retirement obligation in the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation aro the

actual asset return for this plan equaled or exceeded percent during each year total pension expense for wa billion an increase in the expected long term return on plan asset or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense and vice versa an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long term rate of return assumption percent increase in this assumption for the company primary pension plan which accounted for about percent of companywide pension expense would have reduced total pension plan expense for by approximately million percent increase in the discount rate for this plan would have reduced pension expense for by approximately million the aggregate funded status recognized at december wa net liability of approximately billion an increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation thus changing the funded status of plan at december the company used discount rate of percent to measure the obligation for the pension plan an indication of the sensitivity of pension liability to the discount rate assumption percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company primary pension plan which accounted for about percent of the companywide pension obligation would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately million which would have decreased the plan underfunded status from approximately billion to billion for the company opeb plan expense for wa million and the total liability which reflected the unfunded status of the plan at the end of wa billion for the main opeb plan the company used percent discount rate to measure expense in and percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligation at december discount rate change similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis resulted in an immaterial

committee all rac member are degreed professional each with more than year of experience in various aspect of reserve estimation relating to reservoir engineering petroleum engineering earth science or finance the member are knowledgeable in sec guideline for proved reserve classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserve estimate the reserve activity are managed by two operating company level reserve manager these two reserve manager are not member of the rac so to preserve corporate level independence the rac ha the following primary responsibility establish the policy and process used within the operating unit to estimate reserve provide independent review and oversight of the business unit recommended reserve estimate and change confirm that proved reserve are recognized in accordance with sec guideline determine that reserve volume are calculated using consistent and appropriate standard procedure and technology and maintain the corporate reserve

business unit to review and discus reserve change recommended by the various asset team major change are also reviewed with the company strategy and planning committee whose member include the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer the company annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the board of director if major change to reserve were to occur between the annual review those matter would also be discussed with the board rac subteams also conduct in depth review during the year of many of the field that have large proved reserve quantity these review include an examination of the proved reserve record and documentation of their compliance with the corporate reserve manual technology used in establishing proved reserve addition in addition to chevron proved
