intent on increasing their market share such airbus and entrant from china we are focused on improving our product and process and continuing cost reduction effort we intend to continue to compete with other aircraft manufacturer by providing customer with airplane and service that deliver superior design safety efficiency and value to customer around the world bd face strong competition primarily from lockheed martin corporation northrop grumman corporation raytheon technology corporation general dynamic corporation and spacex non company such bae system and airbus group continue to build strategic presence in the market by strengthening their north american operation and partnering with defense company in addition certain competitor have occasionally formed team with other competitor to address specific customer requirement bd expects the trend of strong competition to continue into the commercial and defense service market are extremely challenging and are made up of many of the strong and non competitor facing bca and bd along with other competitor in those market bgs leverage our extensive service network offering product and service which span the life cycle of our defense and commercial aircraft program training fleet service and logistics maintenance and engineering modification and upgrade well the daily cycle of gate to gate operation bgs expects the market to remain highly competitive in and intends to grow market share by leveraging high level of customer satisfaction and productivity of contentsregulatory mattersour business are heavily regulated in of our market we work with numerous government agency and entity including but not limited to all of the branch of the military the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the federal aviation administration faa and the department of homeland security similar government authority exist in our non market government contract the government and other government may terminate any of our government contract at their convenience well for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirement if any of our government contract were to be terminated for convenience we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation cost if any of our government contract were to be terminated for default generally the government would pay only for the work that ha been accepted and could require to pay the difference the original contract price and the cost to re procure the contract item net of the work accepted from the original contract the government can also hold liable for damage resulting from the default commercial aircraft in the our commercial aircraft product are required to comply with faa regulation governing production and quality system airworthiness and installation approval repair procedure and continuing operational safety new aircraft model and new derivative aircraft are required to obtain faa certification prior to entry into service outside the similar requirement exist for airworthiness installation and operational approval these requirement are generally administered by the national aviation authority of each country and in the case of europe coordinated by the european union aviation safety agency environmental we are subject to various federal state local and non law and regulation relating to environmental protection including the discharge treatment storage disposal and remediation of hazardous substance and waste we could also be affected by law and regulation relating to climate change including law limiting or otherwise related to greenhouse gas emission these law and regulation could lead to increased environmental compliance expenditure increased energy and raw material cost and new and or additional investment in design and technology we continually ass our compliance status and management of environmental matter to ensure our operation are in compliance with all applicable environmental law and regulation investigation remediation and operation and maintenance cost associated with environmental compliance and management of site are normal recurring part of our operation these cost often are allowable cost under our contract with the government it is reasonably possible that cost incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have material impact on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow if additional work requirement or more stringent clean up standard are imposed by regulator new area of soil air and groundwater contamination are discovered and or expansion of work scope are prompted by the result of investigation for additional information relating to environmental contingency see note to our consolidated financial statement non sale our non sale are subject to both and non governmental regulation and procurement policy and practice including regulation relating to import export control tariff investment exchange control anti corruption and repatriation of earnings non sale are also subject to varying currency political and economic risk raw material part and subassemblieswe are highly dependent on the availability of essential material part and subassemblies from our supplier and subcontractor the most important raw material required for our aerospace product of contentsare aluminum sheet plate forging and extrusion titanium sheet plate forging and extrusion and composite including carbon and boron although alternative source generally exist for these raw material qualification of the source could take year or more during result of the russia ukraine war we suspended purchasing titanium from russia this ha not disrupted our operation we have been able to use inventory on hand and identify alternative source many major component and product equipment item are procured or subcontracted on sole source basis we continue to work with small number of sole source supplier to ensure continuity of supply for certain item supplierswe are dependent upon the ability of large number of and non supplier and subcontractor to meet performance specification quality standard and delivery schedule at our anticipated cost while we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third party failure of supplier or subcontractor to meet commitment could adversely affect production schedule and program contract profitability thereby jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitment to our customer we are also dependent on the availability of energy source such electricity at affordable price seasonalityno material portion of our business is

uncertainty and our actual result and future trend may differ materially from our past or projected future performance we urge investor to consider carefully the risk factor described below in evaluating the information contained in this report risk related to our business and operationswe depend heavily on commercial airline subjecting to unique risk market condition have significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related service the commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long term trend in airline passenger and cargo traffic the principal factor underlying long term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging market demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline profitability availability of aircraft financing world trade policy government to government relation technological advance price and other competitive factor fuel price terrorism pandemic epidemic and environmental regulation historically the airline industry ha been cyclical and competitive and ha experienced significant profit swing and constant challenge to be more cost competitive significant deterioration in the global economic environment the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of our major customer could result in fewer new order for aircraft or service or could cause customer to seek to postpone or cancel contractual order and or payment to which could result in lower revenue profitability and cash flow and reduction in our contractual backlog in addition our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over period of several year any of these macroeconomic industry or customer impact could unexpectedly affect delivery over long period we enter into firm fixed price aircraft sale contract with indexed price escalation clause which could subject to loss if we have cost overrun or if increase in our cost exceed the applicable escalation rate commercial aircraft sale contract are often entered into year the aircraft are delivered in order to help account for economic fluctuation between the contract date and delivery date aircraft pricing generally consists of fixed amount modified by price escalation formula derived from labor commodity and other price index our revenue estimate are based on current expectation with respect to these escalation formula but the actual escalation amount are outside of our control escalation factor can fluctuate significantly from period to period change in escalation amount can significantly impact revenue and operating margin in our commercial airplane business we derive significant portion of our revenue from limited number of commercial airline we can make no assurance that any customer will exercise purchase option fulfill existing purchase commitment or purchase additional product or service from in addition fleet decision airline consolidation or financial challenge involving any of our major commercial airline customer could significantly reduce our revenue and limit our opportunity to generate profit from those customer of contentsairlines also are experiencing increased fuel and other cost and the global economy is experiencing high inflation our commercial airplane business depends on our ability to maintain healthy production system ensure every airplane in our production system conforms to our exacting specification achieve planned production rate target successfully develop and certify new aircraft or new derivative aircraft and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standard the commercial aircraft business is extremely complex involving extensive coordination and integration with and non supplier highly skilled labor performed by thousand of employee of and other partner and stringent and evolving regulatory requirement and performance and reliability standard the faa ha been working to implement safety reform such the faa reauthorization act and the aircraft certification safety and accountability act acsaa one of these section of the acsaa prohibited the faa from issuing type certificate to aircraft after december unless the aircraft flight crew alerting system met certain specification the consolidated appropriation act amended section of the acsaa such that application for original or amended type certification that were submitted to the faa prior to december including those of the and are no longer subject to the crew alerting specification of section additionally beginning one year after the faa issue the type certificate for the any new max aircraft must include certain safety enhancement to be issued an original airworthiness certification by the faa these enhancement are included in boeing application for the certification for the and the sufficiency of these enhancement will be determined by the faa beginning three year after the issuance of type certificate for the all previously delivered max aircraft must be retrofitted with these safety enhancement the holder of the type certificate boeing is required to bear any cost of these safety enhancement retrofit we have provisioned for the estimated cost associated with the safety enhancement and do not expect those cost to be material if we experience delay in achieving certification and or incorporating safety enhancement future revenue cash flow and result of operation could be adversely impacted comparable agency in other country may adopt similar change to the extent the faa or similar regulatory agency outside the implement more stringent regulation we may incur additional compliance cost in addition the introduction of new aircraft program and or derivative such the and involves increased risk associated with meeting development testing certification and production schedule in addition we have experienced production quality issue including in our supply chain which have contributed to lower delivery including suspension of delivery from may to august we continue to conduct inspection and rework on built and stored aircraft number of our customer have contractual remedy including compensation for late delivery or right to reject individual airplane delivery based on delivery delay delay on the and program have resulted in and may continue to result in customer the right to terminate order be compensated for late delivery and or substitute order for other boeing aircraft we must minimize disruption caused by production change achieve operational stability and implement productivity improvement in order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability we have previously announced plan to adjust production rate on several of our commercial aircraft program the program is currently producing at low rate and we expect to gradually increase to per month in production of the is currently paused and is expected to resume in the program ha experienced operational and supply chain challenge stabilizing production at per month we plan to gradually increase production rate based on market demand and supply chain capacity in addition we continue to seek opportunity to reduce the cost of building our aircraft including working with our supplier to reduce supplier cost identifying and implementing productivity improvement and optimizing how we manage inventory if production rate change at any of our of contentscommercial aircraft assembly facility are delayed or create significant disruption to our production system or if our supplier can not timely deliver component to at the cost and rate necessary to achieve our target we may be unable to meet delivery schedule and or the financial performance of one or more of our program may suffer operational challenge impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft program could result in additional production delay and or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft either of which would negatively impact our revenue and operating margin our commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex operational issue including delay or defect in supplier component failure to meet internal performance plan or delay or failure to achieve required regulatory approval could result in additional of sequence work and increased production cost well delayed delivery to customer impact to aircraft performance and or increased warranty or fleet support cost we and our supplier are experiencing supply chain disruption result of the lingering impact of covid global supply chain constraint and labor instability we and our supplier are also experiencing inflationary pressure we continue to monitor the health and stability of the supply chain we ramp up production these factor have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial position result of operation and cash flow if our commercial aircraft fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirement and or potentially required sustainability standard we could face additional cost and or lower revenue developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standard and or potentially required sustainability standard well those of customer and regulatory agency can be costly and technologically challenging these challenge are particularly significant with newer aircraft program any failure of any boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirement could result in disruption to our operation higher cost and or lower revenue change in level of government defense spending or acquisition priority could negatively impact our financial position and result of operation we derive substantial portion of our revenue from the government primarily from defense related program with the united state department of defense dod level of defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factor such the evolving nature of the national security threat environment national security strategy foreign policy the domestic political environment macroeconomic condition and the ability of the government to enact relevant legislation such authorization and appropriation bill the timeliness of and future appropriation for government department and agency remains recurrent risk lapse in appropriation for government department or agency would result in full or partial government shutdown which could impact the company operation alternatively congress may fund government department and agency with one or more continuing resolution however this would restrict the execution of certain program activity and delay new program or competition in addition long term uncertainty remains with respect to overall level of defense spending in and beyond government discretionary spending including defense spending is likely to continue to be subject to pressure there continues to be uncertainty with respect to future acquisition priority and program level appropriation for the dod and other government agency including nasa including change to national security and defense priority and tension between modernization investment sustainment investment and investment in new technology or emergent capability future investment priority change or budget cut including change associated with the authorization and appropriation process could result in reduction cancellation and or delay of existing contract or program or future program opportunity any of these impact could have material effect on the result of the company financial position result of operation and or cash flow of contentsin addition result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both defense spending and the evolving nature of the national security threat environment we also expect the dod to continue to emphasize affordability innovation cybersecurity and delivery of technical data and software in it procurement process including the implementation of cybersecurity compliance requirement on the defense industrial base for which the supply chain may not be fully prepared we and our supplier will need to continue to adjust successfully to these changing acquisition priority and policy or our revenue and market share could be impacted our ability to deliver product and service that satisfy customer requirement is heavily dependent on the performance and financial stability of our subcontractor and supplier well on the availability of highly skilled labor raw material and other component we rely on other company including and non subcontractor and supplier to provide and produce raw material integrated component and sub assembly and production commodity and to perform of the service that we provide to our customer many of our supplier are experiencing inflationary pressure well disruption due to the lingering impact of covid global supply chain constraint and labor instability if one or more of our supplier or subcontractor continue to experience financial difficulty delivery delay or other performance problem we may be unable to meet commitment to our customer and our financial position result of operation and cash flow may continue to be adversely impacted in addition if one or more of the raw material on which we depend such aluminum titanium or composite becomes unavailable to or our supplier or is available only at very high price we may be unable to deliver one or more of our product in timely fashion or at budgeted cost for example we suspended purchasing titanium from russia during result of the russia ukraine war we believe we have sufficient material and part to avoid production disruption in the near term but future impact to our production from disruption in our supply chain are possible in some instance we depend upon single source of supply any service disruption from one of these supplier either due to circumstance beyond the supplier control such geopolitical development or result of performance problem or financial difficulty could have material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitment to our customer or increase our operating cost competition within our market and with respect to the product we sell may reduce our future contract and sale the market in which we operate are highly competitive and one or more of our competitor may have more extensive or more specialized engineering manufacturing and marketing capability than we do in some area in our bca business we face aggressive international competition intent on increasing market share in our bd business we anticipate that the effect of defense industry consolidation shifting acquisition and budget priority and continued cost pressure at our dod and non customer will intensify competition for many of our bd product our bgs segment face competition from many of the same strong and non competitor facing bca and bd furthermore we are facing increased international competition and cross border consolidation of competition and procurement and compliance requirement that could limit our ability to be cost competitive in the international market there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully our current or future competitor or that the competitive pressure we face will not result in reduced revenue and market share of contentswe derive significant portion of our revenue from non sale and are subject to the risk of business in other country in non customer which includes foreign military sale fm accounted for approximately of our revenue we expect that non sale will continue to account for significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future result we are subject to risk of doing business internationally including change in regulatory requirement or other executive branch action such executive order change in the global trade environment including dispute with authority in non jurisdiction including international trade authority that could impact sale and or delivery of product and service outside the and or impose cost on our customer in the form of tariff duty or penalty attributable to the importation of boeing product and service change to and non government policy including sourcing restriction requirement to expend portion of program fund locally and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirement fluctuation in international currency exchange rate volatility in international political and economic environment and change in non national priority and budget which can lead to delay or fluctuation in order the complexity and necessity of using non representative and consultant the uncertainty of the ability of non customer to finance purchase including the availability of financing from the export import bank of the united state uncertainty and restriction concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantee imposition of domestic and international tax export control tariff embargo sanction such those imposed on russia and other trade restriction the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many country compliance with variety of non law well law affecting the activity of company abroad and unforeseen development and condition including terrorism war epidemic and international tension and conflict while the impact of these factor is difficult to predict any one or more of these factor could adversely affect our operation in the future for example since the and china have imposed tariff on each other import certain aircraft part and component that boeing procures are subject to these tariff we are mitigating import cost through duty drawback custom procedure overall the china trade relationship remains stalled economic and national security concern continue to be challenge china is significant market for commercial aircraft boeing ha long standing relationship with our chinese customer who represent key component of our commercial aircraft backlog for the max there is uncertainty regarding timing of resumption of delivery in china which is still subject to final regulatory approval if we are unable to obtain additional order from china in the future our market share could be adversely affected furthermore following russia invasion of ukraine we suspended our operation in russia due to sanction and export control and the war ha negatively impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business and financial result impact from future potential deterioration in trade relation between the and one or more other country could have material adverse impact on our financial position result of operation and or cash flow of contentswe use estimate and make assumption in accounting for contract and program change in our estimate and or assumption could adversely affect our future financial result contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risk estimating revenue and cost and making assumption for schedule and technical issue due to the size and nature of many of our contract and program the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variable assumption have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because cost also include expected increase in wage and employee benefit material price and allocated fixed cost incentive or penalty related to performance on contract are considered in estimating sale and profit rate and are recorded when there is sufficient information for to ass anticipated performance customer and supplier claim and assertion are also assessed and considered in estimating revenue cost and profit rate estimate of future award fee are also included in revenue and profit rate with respect to each of our commercial aircraft program inventoriable production cost including overhead program tooling and other non recurring cost and routine warranty cost are accumulated and charged cost of sale by program instead of by individual unit or contract program consists of the estimated number of unit accounting quantity of product to be produced in continuing long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contract limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimate to establish the relationship of sale to cost of sale program accounting requires estimate of the number of unit to be produced and sold in program the period over which the unit can reasonably be expected to be produced and the unit expected sale price production cost program tooling and other non recurring cost and routine warranty cost for the total program several factor determine accounting quantity including firm order letter of intent from prospective customer and market study change to customer or model mix production cost and rate learning curve change to price escalation index cost of derivative aircraft supplier performance customer and supplier negotiation settlement supplier claim and or certification issue can impact these estimate in addition on development program such the and we are subject to risk with respect to the timing and condition of aircraft certification including potential gap between when aircraft are certified in various jurisdiction change in certification process and our estimate with respect to timing of future certification which could have an impact on overall program status any such change in estimate relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financial performance because of the significance of the judgment and estimation process described materially different revenue and profit amount could be recorded if we used different assumption revised our estimate or if the underlying circumstance were to change change in underlying assumption circumstance or estimate may adversely affect future period financial performance for additional information on our accounting policy for recognizing sale and profit see our discussion under management discussion and analysis critical accounting policy estimate accounting for long term contract program accounting on page and note to our consolidated financial statement on page of this form we may not realize the anticipated benefit of merger acquisition joint venture strategic alliance or divestiture part of our business strategy we may merge with or acquire business and or form joint venture and strategic alliance whether we realize the anticipated benefit from these acquisition and related activity depends in part upon our ability to integrate the operation of the acquired business the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operation accordingly our financial result could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issue legacy liability transaction related charge amortization of expense related to intangible charge for impairment of long term asset credit of contentsguarantees partner performance and indemnification consolidation of joint venture could also impact our reported result of operation or financial position while we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedure and process to mitigate these risk there is no assurance that these transaction will be successful we also may make strategic divestiture from time to time these transaction may result in continued financial involvement in the divested business such through guarantee or other financial arrangement following the transaction nonperformance by those divested business could affect our future financial result through additional payment obligation higher cost or asset write down risk related to our contractswe conduct significant portion of our business pursuant to government contract which are subject to unique risk in of our revenue were earned pursuant to government contract which include fm through the government business conducted pursuant to such contract is subject to extensive procurement regulation and other unique risk our sale to the government are subject to extensive procurement regulation and change to those regulation could increase our cost new procurement regulation or climate or cyber related contractual disclosure or change to existing requirement could increase our compliance cost or otherwise have material impact on the operating margin of our bd and bgs business these requirement may also result in withheld payment and or reduced future business if we fail to comply for example proposal to raise domestic content threshold for our government contract could have negative impact on our business compliance cost attributable to current and potential future procurement regulation such these could negatively impact our financial position result of operation and or cash flow the government may modify curtail or terminate one or more of our contract the government contracting party may modify curtail or terminate it contract and subcontract with without prior notice and either at it convenience or for default based on performance in addition funding pursuant to our government contract may be reduced or withheld part of the congressional appropriation process due to fiscal constraint change in national security strategy and or priority or other reason further uncertainty with respect to ongoing program could also result in the event that the government finance it operation through temporary funding measure such continuing resolution rather than full year appropriation any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and or modification curtailment or termination of one or more large program could have material adverse effect on our financial position result of operation and or cash flow we are subject to government inquiry and investigation including periodic audit of cost that we determine are reimbursable under government contract government agency including the defense contract audit agency and the defense contract management agency routinely audit government contractor these agency review our performance under contract cost structure and compliance with applicable law regulation and standard well the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control system and policy any cost found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to specific contract will be deemed non reimbursable and to the extent already reimbursed must be refunded any inadequacy in our system and policy could result in withholds on billed receivables penalty and reduced future business furthermore if any audit inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activity we could be subject to civil and criminal penalty and administrative sanction including termination of contract forfeiture of profit suspension of payment fine and suspension or debarment from doing business with the government we also of contentscould suffer reputational harm if allegation of impropriety were made against even if such allegation are later determined to be false we enter into fixed price contract which could subject to loss if we have cost overrun our bd and bgs defense business generated approximately and of their revenue from fixed price contract while fixed price contract enable to benefit from performance improvement cost reduction and efficiency they also subject to the risk of reduced margin or incurring loss if we are unable to achieve estimated cost and revenue if our estimated cost exceed our estimated price we recognize reach forward loss which can significantly affect our reported result for example during the year ended december bd recorded additional loss on several fixed price development program we continue to experience near term production disruption and inefficiency due to supplier disruption labor instability and factory performance these factor have contributed to significant earnings charge on number of fixed price development program which are expected to adversely affect cash flow in future period and may result in future earnings charge and adverse cash flow effect new program could also have risk for reach forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance the long term nature of many of our contract make the process of estimating cost and revenue on fixed price contract inherently risky fixed price contract often contain price incentive and penalty tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impact on margin in addition some of our contract have specific provision relating to cost schedule and performance estimating cost to complete fixed price development contract is generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed price production contract many of these development program have highly complex design in addition technical or quality issue that arise during development could lead to schedule delay and higher cost to complete which could result in material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition example of significant bd fixed price development contract include commercial crew kc tanker mq red hawk vc presidential aircraft and commercial and military satellite we enter into cost type contract which also carry risk our bd and bgs defense business generated approximately and of their revenue from cost type contracting arrangement some of these are development program that have complex design and technical challenge these cost type program typically have award or incentive fee that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended period in these case the associated financial risk are primarily in reduced fee lower profit rate or program cancellation if cost schedule or technical performance issue arise program whose contract are primarily cost type include ground based midcourse defense proprietary and space launch system program we enter into contract that include in orbit incentive payment that subject to risk contract in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contract include in orbit incentive payment these in orbit payment may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance in both case the in orbit incentive payment is at risk if the satellite doe not perform to specification for up to year after acceptance the net present value of in orbit incentive fee we ultimately expect to realize is recognized revenue in the construction period if the satellite fails to meet contractual performance criterion customer will not be obligated to continue making in orbit payment and or we may be required to provide refund to the customer and incur significant charge of contentsrisks related to cybersecurity and business disruptionsunauthorized access to our our customer and or our supplier information and system could negatively impact our business we rely extensively on information technology system and network to operate our company and meet our business objective cyber threat increase in volume and sophistication the risk to the security of these system and network and to the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data they house continues to evolve requiring constant vigilance and concerted company wide risk management effort cyberattack or security breach whether experienced directly or through our supply chain could among other serious consequence result in loss of intellectual property unauthorized access to various category of sensitive proprietary or customer data disruption or degradation of business operation or compromise of product or service to address these risk we maintain an extensive network of technical security control policy enforcement mechanism monitoring system and management oversight we also have established cybersecurity governance council to strengthen governance and coordination of cybersecurity activity while these measure are designed to prevent detect and respond to unauthorized activity there is no guarantee that they will be sufficient to prevent or mitigate the risk of cyberattack or the potentially serious reputational operational or financial impact that may result in november we discovered cybersecurity incident that impacted certain system of jeppesen wholly owned boeing subsidiary that provides flight planning and navigation service we determined that the incident posed no risk to flight safety we promptly notified law enforcement regulatory authority and customer launched an investigation and took additional step to protect the integrity of our system while this incident ha not had material impact on future incident like this one could have material impact on our business operation and reputation in addition we manage information and information technology system for certain customer and or supplier many of these customer and or supplier face similar security threat if we were unable to protect against the unauthorized access release and or corruption of our customer and or supplier confidential classified or personally identifiable information our reputation could be damaged and or we could face financial or other loss business disruption could seriously affect our future sale and financial condition or increase our cost and expense our business may be impacted by disruption including threat to physical security or our information technology system extreme weather including effect of climate change or other act of nature and pandemic or other public health crisis any of these disruption could affect our internal operation or our supplier operation and delay delivery of product and service to our customer any significant production delay or any destruction manipulation or improper use of boeing or our supplier data information system or network could impact our sale increase our expense and or have an adverse effect on the reputation of boeing and of our product and service risk related to legal and regulatory mattersthe outcome of litigation and of government inquiry and investigation involving our business is unpredictable and an

product to compete with ours after the acquisition of majority share of bombardier series in airbus continues to expand in the seat transcontinental market other competitor are also in different phase of developing commercial jet aircraft including commercial aircraft corporation of china ltd comac which delivered it first aircraft in some of these competitor have historically enjoyed access to

currently producing at low rate and expect to gradually return to per month in in the third quarter of we determined that production rate below per month represented abnormally low production rate and result in abnormal production cost we also determined that the inspection and rework cost on inventoried aircraft are excessive and should also be accounted for abnormal production cost that are required to be expensed incurred cumulative abnormal cost recorded through december totaled billion during the fourth quarter of we adjusted the total estimate of abnormal production cost up to billion with most being incurred by the end of at december we were expecting to incur approximately billion of abnormal production cost on cumulative basis the increase wa primarily driven by decision in the fourth quarter of to slow near term production due to supply chain constraint and increased inspection and rework cost we continue to work with customer and supplier regarding timing of future delivery and production rate change during the fourth quarter of we recorded loss of billion on the program primarily due to the additional rework well other action required to resume delivery taking longer than expected these impact have resulted in longer than expected delivery delay and associated customer consideration fleet support we provide the operator of our commercial aircraft with assistance and service to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation collectively known fleet support service these activity and service begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout

horizon between go ahead and planned initial delivery for major commercial airplane derivative and program go ahead and initial model in development during development schedule shown above are subject to number of uncertainty including change in certification requirement the timing of certification will ultimately be determined by the regulator additional considerationsthe development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex involving extensive coordination and integration with supplier and highly skilled labor from employee and other partner meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standard well those of customer and regulator can be costly and technologically challenging such the production issue and associated rework in addition the introduction of new aircraft and derivative such the and involves increased risk associated with meeting development production and certification schedule these challenge include increased global regulatory scrutiny of all development aircraft in the wake of the max accident result our ability to deliver aircraft on time satisfy performance and reliability standard and achieve or maintain applicable program profitability is subject to significant risk factor that could result in lower margin or material charge if an airplane program ha or is determined to have reach forward loss include the following change to the program accounting quantity customer and model mix production cost and rate change to price escalation factor due to change in the inflation rate or other economic indicator performance or reliability issue involving completed aircraft capital expenditure and other cost associated with increasing or adding new production capacity learning curve additional change incorporation

estimate accounting for long term contractssubstantially all contract at bd and certain contract at bgs are long term contract our long term contract typically represent single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying good and or service and the significant service of integration that we provide accounting for long term contract involves judgmental process of estimating the total sale cost and profit for each performance obligation cost of sale is recognized incurred and revenue is determined by adding proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported cost of sale due to the size duration and nature of many of our long term contract the estimation of total sale and cost through completion is complicated and subject to many variable total sale estimate are based on negotiated contract price and quantity modified by our assumption regarding contract option change order incentive and award provision associated with technical performance and price adjustment clause such inflation or index based clause the majority of these long term contract are with the government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit federal acquisition regulation provide guidance on the type of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price total cost estimate are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract term historical performance trend business base and other economic projection factor that influence these estimate include inflationary trend technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trend business volume assumption asset utilization anticipated labor agreement and lingering impact of covid revenue and cost estimate for all significant long term contract performance obligation are reviewed and reassessed quarterly change in these estimate could result in recognition of cumulative catch up adjustment to the performance obligation inception to date revenue cost of sale and profit in the period in which such change are made change in revenue and cost estimate could also result in reach forward loss or an adjustment to reach forward loss which would be recorded immediately in earnings net cumulative catch up adjustment for change in estimated revenue and cost at completion across all long term contract including the impact of increase in estimated loss on unexercised option increased loss from operation by million million and million in and respectively the cumulative catch up adjustment in were primarily due to loss recognized on the vc kc tanker mq commercial crew and red hawk program these are all fixed price development program and there is ongoing risk that similar loss may have to be recognized in future period on these and or other program due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if we used different assumption or if the underlying circumstance were to change change in underlying assumption estimate internal and supplier performance inflationary trend or other circumstance may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future period if the combined gross margin for our profitable long term contract had been estimated to be higher or lower by during it would have increased or decreased pre tax income for the year by approximately million program accountingprogram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate revenue cost and gross profit margin for the defined program accounting quantity program consists of the estimated number of unit accounting quantity of product to be produced in continuing long term production effort for of contentsdelivery under existing and anticipated contract the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimate factor that must be estimated include program accounting quantity sale price labor and employee benefit cost material cost procured part cost major component cost overhead cost program tooling and other non recurring cost and warranty cost estimation of the accounting quantity for each program take into account several factor that are indicative of the demand for the particular program such firm order letter of intent from prospective customer and market study total estimated program sale are determined by estimating the model mix and sale price for all unsold unit within the accounting quantity added together with the sale price for all undelivered unit under contract the sale price for all undelivered unit within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly cost estimate are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contract with supplier historical performance trend and business base and other economic projection factor that influence these estimate include production rate internal and subcontractor performance trend learning curve change incorporation regulatory requirement in connection with certification flight test and certification schedule performance or reliability issue involving completed aircraft customer and or supplier claim or assertion asset utilization anticipated labor agreement inflationary or deflationary trend and lingering impact of covid to ensure reliability in our estimate we employ rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on quarterly basis this includes reassessing the accounting quantity change in estimate of program gross profit margin are normally recognized on prospective basis however when estimated cost to complete program plus cost already included in inventory exceed estimated revenue from the program loss is recorded in the current period reduction to the estimated loss are included in the gross profit margin for undelivered unit in the accounting quantity whereas increase to the estimated loss are recorded an earnings charge in the period in which the loss is determined the and program had near break even or single digit margin at december adverse change to the revenue and or cost estimate for these program could result in earnings charge in future period program the program had near break even gross margin at december the level of profitability on the program will be subject to number of factor these factor include continued production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption customer negotiation further production rate adjustment for the or other commercial aircraft program contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risk associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification one or more of these factor could result in additional reach forward loss on the program in future period which may be material program during the fourth quarter of we recorded loss of billion on the program primarily due to rework driving longer delivery delay than were previously expected and associated customer consideration during the fourth quarter of we increased the program accounting quantity by unit due to the program normal progress of obtaining additional order and delivering aircraft the increase in the accounting quantity improved the program profit margin our program revenue and cost assumption reflect our current best estimate however if we are required to reduce the accounting quantity and or production rate experience further delivery delay incur additional customer consideration or experience other factor that result in lower margin the program could record additional loss in future period which may be material of contentspension plansmany of our employee have earned benefit under defined benefit pension plan the majority of employee that had participated in defined benefit pension plan have transitioned to company funded defined contribution retirement saving plan accounting rule require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan asset these measurement are based upon several assumption including the discount rate and the expected long term rate of asset return future change in assumption or difference between actual and expected outcome can significantly affect our future annual expense projected benefit obligation and shareholder equity the projected benefit obligation is sensitive to discount rate the projected benefit obligation would decrease by million or increase by million if the discount rate increased or decreased by basis point basis point change in the discount rate would not have significant impact on pension cost however net periodic pension cost is sensitive to change in the expected long term rate of asset return decrease or increase of basis point in the expected long term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased net periodic pension cost by million see note of the note to our consolidated financial statement which includes the discount rate and expected long term rate of asset return assumption for the last three year deferred income tax valuation allowancethe company had deferred income tax asset of million at december that can be used in future year to offset taxable income and reduce income tax payable the company had deferred income tax liability of million at december that will partially offset deferred income tax asset and result in higher taxable income in future year and increase income tax payable tax law determines whether future reversal of temporary difference will result in taxable and deductible amount that offset each other in future year the particular year in which temporary difference result in taxable or deductible amount generally are determined by the timing of the recovery of the related asset or settlement of the related liability on quarterly basis we ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset against future source of taxable income and reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax asset by recording valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not defined likelihood of more than that all or portion of such asset will not be realized this assessment take into account both positive and negative evidence recent history of financial reporting loss is heavily weighted source of objectively verifiable negative evidence due to our recent history of loss we determined we could not include future projected earnings in our analysis rather we use systematic and logical method to estimate when deferred tax liability will reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax asset will reverse and generate tax deduction the selection of methodology and assessment of when temporary difference will result in taxable or deductible amount involves significant management judgment and is inherently complex and subjective we believe that the methodology we use are reasonable and can be replicated on consistent basis in future period deferred tax liability represent the assumed source of future taxable income and the majority are assumed to generate taxable amount during the next five year deferred tax asset include amount related to pension and other postretirement benefit that are assumed to generate significant deductible amount beyond five year the company valuation allowance of million at december primarily relates to pension and other postretirement benefit obligation deferred tax asset tax credit and other carryforwards that are assumed to reverse beyond the period in which reversal of deferred tax liability are assumed to occur during the company increased the valuation allowance by million primarily due to tax credit and other carryforwards generated in that of contentscannot be realized in partially offset by favorable pension remeasurement until the company generates sustained level of profitability additional valuation allowance may have to be recorded with corresponding adverse impact on earnings and or other comprehensive income for additional information regarding income tax see note of the note to the consolidated financial statement item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskinterest rate riskwe have financial instrument that are subject to interest rate risk principally fixed and floating rate debt obligation and customer financing asset and liability the investor in our fixed rate debt obligation do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligation prior to maturity therefore exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed rate debt of december we do not have any significant floating rate debt obligation historically we have not experienced material gain or loss on our customer financing asset and liability due to interest rate change foreign currency exchange rate riskwe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipt from customer and payment to supplier in foreign currency we use foreign currency forward contract to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payment and receipt related to our ongoing business foreign currency forward contract are sensitive to change in foreign currency exchange rate at december increase or decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contract would have increased or decreased our unrealized loss by million consistent with the use of these contract to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuation such unrealized loss or gain would be offset by corresponding gain or loss respectively in the remeasurement of the underlying transaction being hedged when taken together these forward currency contract and the offsetting underlying commitment do not create material market risk commodity price riskwe are subject to commodity price risk relating to commodity purchase contract for item used in production that are subject to change in the market price we use commodity swap and commodity purchase contract to hedge against these potentially unfavorable price change our commodity purchase contract and derivative are both sensitive to change in the market price at december increase or decrease in the market price in our commodity derivative would have increased or decreased our unrealized loss by million consistent with the use of these contract to neutralize the effect of market price fluctuation such unrealized loss or gain would be offset by corresponding gain or loss respectively in the remeasurement of the underlying transaction being hedged when taken together these commodity purchase contract and the

the account of all majority owned subsidiary and variable interest entity that are required to be consolidated all significant intercompany account and transaction have been eliminated described in note we operate in four reportable segment commercial airplane bca defense space security bd global service bgs and boeing capital bcc use of estimatesthe preparation of financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability and disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period actual result could differ from those estimate operating cyclefor classification of certain current asset and liability we use the duration of the related contract or program our operating cycle which is generally longer than one year revenue and related cost recognitioncommercial aircraft contract the majority of our bca segment revenue is derived from commercial aircraft contract for each contract we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received we allocate the transaction price to each commercial aircraft performance obligation based on relative standalone selling price adjusted by an escalation formula specified in the customer agreement revenue is recognized for each commercial aircraft performance obligation at the point in time when the aircraft is completed and accepted by the customer we use program accounting to determine the amount reported cost of sale payment for commercial aircraft sale are received in accordance with the customer agreement which generally includes deposit upon order and additional payment in accordance with payment schedule with the balance being due immediately prior to or at aircraft delivery advance and progress billing contract liability are normal and customary for commercial aircraft contract and not considered significant financing component they are intended to protect from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of it obligation under the contract long term contract substantially all contract at bd and certain contract at bgs are long term contract with the government and other customer that generally extend over several year product sale under long term contract primarily include fighter jet rotorcraft cybersecurity product surveillance suite advanced weapon missile defense military derivative aircraft satellite system and modification of commercial passenger aircraft to cargo freighter sale of service under long term contract primarily include support and maintenance agreement associated with our commercial and defense product and space travel on commercial crew of contentsfor each long term contract we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received we allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation to deliver good or service or collection of good and or service based on the relative standalone selling price long term contract will typically represent single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying good and or service and the significant service of integration that we provide while the scope and price on certain long term contract may be modified over their life the transaction price is based on current right and obligation under the contract and doe not include potential modification until they are agreed upon with the customer when applicable cumulative adjustment or separate recognition for the additional scope and price may result long term contract can be negotiated with fixed price or price in which we are reimbursed for cost incurred plus an agreed upon profit the federal acquisition regulation provide guidance on the type of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing the price for contract with the government certain long term contract include in the transaction price variable consideration such incentive and award fee if specified target are achieved the amount included in the transaction price represents the expected value based on weighted probability or the most likely amount long term contract revenue is recognized over the contract term over time the work progress either product are produced or service are rendered we generally recognize revenue over time we perform on long term contract because of continuous transfer of control to the customer for government contract this continuous transfer of control to the customer is supported by clause in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience pay for cost incurred plus reasonable profit and take control of any work in process similarly for non government contract the customer typically control the work in process evidenced either by contractual termination clause or by our right to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date on product or service that do not have an alternative use to the company the accounting for long term contract involves judgmental process of estimating total sale cost and profit for each performance obligation cost of sale is recognized incurred the amount reported revenue is determined by adding proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported cost of sale recognizing revenue cost are incurred provides an objective measure of progress on the long term contract and thereby best depicts the extent of transfer of control to the customer for long term contract for which revenue is recognized over time change in estimated revenue cost of sale and the related effect on operating income are recognized using cumulative catch up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the change on current and prior period based on long term contract percentage of completion when the current estimate of total revenue and cost at completion for long term contract indicate loss provision for the entire reach forward loss on the long term contract is recognized the table below reflects the impact of net cumulative catch up adjustment for change in estimated revenue and cost at completion across all long term contract including the impact to loss from operation from increase in estimated loss on unexercised option for the year ended december to revenue increase to loss from operation decrease to diluted eps significant adjustment during the three year ended december included loss on vc kc tanker mq commercial crew and red hawk program of contentsdue to the significance of judgment in the estimation process change in underlying assumption estimate internal and supplier performance inflationary trend or other circumstance may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future period payment under long term contract may be received before or after revenue is recognized the government customer typically withholds payment of small portion of the contract price until contract completion therefore long term contract typically generate unbilled receivables contract asset but may generate advance and progress billing contract liability long term contract unbilled receivables and advance and progress billing are not considered significant financing component because they are intended to protect either the customer or the company in the event that some or all of the obligation under the contract are not completed commercial spare part contract certain contract at our bgs segment include sale of commercial spare part for each contract we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received the spare part have discrete unit price that represent fair value we generally consider each spare part to be separate performance obligation revenue is recognized for each commercial spare part performance obligation at the point in time of delivery to the customer we may provide our customer with right to return commercial spare part where customer may receive full or partial refund credit applied to amount owed different product in exchange or any combination of these item we consider the potential for customer return in the estimated transaction price the amount reported cost of sale is recorded at average cost payment for commercial spare part sale are typically received shortly after delivery other service revenue contract certain contract at our bgs segment are for sale of service to commercial customer including maintenance training data analytics and information based service we recognize revenue for these service performance obligation over time the service are rendered the method of measuring progress such straight line or billable amount varies depending upon which method best depicts the transfer of control to the customer based on the type of service performed cost of sale is recorded incurred concession sharing arrangement we account for sale concession to our customer in consideration of their purchase of product and service reduction of the transaction price and the revenue that is recognized for the related performance obligation the sale concession incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain supplier in accordance with concession sharing arrangement we record these reimbursement which are presumed to represent reduction in the price of the vendor product or service reduction in cost of product unbilled receivables and advance and progress billing unbilled receivables contract asset arise when the company recognizes revenue for amount which can not yet be billed under term of the contract with the customer advance and progress billing contract liability arise when the company receives payment from customer in advance of recognizing revenue the amount of unbilled receivables or advance and progress billing is determined for each contract financial service revenue we record financial service revenue associated with sale type finance lease operating lease and loan in sale of service on the consolidated statement of operation for sale type lease we recognize selling profit or loss at lease inception if collection of the lease payment is probable for sale type and direct finance lease we record customer financing receivables at lease inception customer financing receivable is recorded at the aggregate of future minimum lease payment estimated residual value of the leased equipment and any deferred incremental direct cost le unearned income income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate level rate of return on the net investment for note receivable we record customer financing receivables net of any unamortized discount and deferred incremental direct cost interest income and amortization of any discount are recorded ratably over the related term of the note of contentsincome recognition is generally suspended for customer financing receivables that are uncollectible we determine that customer financing receivable is uncollectible when based on current information and event it is probable that we will be unable to collect amount due according to the original contractual term we determine customer financing receivable is past due when cash ha not been received upon the due date specified in the contract we evaluate the collectability of customer financing receivables at commencement and on recurring basis if customer financing receivable is determined to be uncollectible the customer is categorized non accrual status when customer is in non accrual status at commencement sale type lease revenue is deferred until substantially all cash ha been received or the customer is removed from non accrual status if we have direct finance lease and or note receivable with customer that is in non accrual status or sale type lease with customer that change to non accrual status after commencement we recognize contractual interest income payment are received to the extent there is sufficient collateral and payment exceed past due principal payment residual value which are reviewed periodically represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the leased equipment actual residual value realized could differ from these estimate decline in estimated residual value that are deemed other than temporary are recognized in the period in which the decline occur for operating lease revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on straight line basis over the term of the lease operating lease asset included in customer financing net are recorded at cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value using the straight line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset we periodically review our estimate of residual value and recognize forecasted change by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense we record asset held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value le cost to sell we evaluate for impairment asset under operating lease when event or change in circumstance indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be le than the carrying value when we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset reinsurance revenue our wholly owned insurance subsidiary astro ltd participates in reinsurance pool for worker compensation the member agreement and practice of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating member individual risk reinsurance revenue were and during and respectively reinsurance cost related to premium and claim paid to the reinsurance pool were and during and respectively revenue and cost are presented net in cost of sale in the consolidated statement of operation research and developmentresearch and development includes cost incurred for experimentation design and testing well bid and proposal effort related to government product and service which are expensed incurred unless the cost are related to certain contractual arrangement with customer cost that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangement are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized consistent with our long term contract accounting policy we have certain research and development arrangement that meet the requirement for best effort research and development accounting accordingly the amount funded by the customer are recognized an offset to our research and development expense rather than contract revenue research and development expense included bid and proposal cost of and in and respectively of contentsshare based compensationwe provide various form of share based compensation to our employee for award settled in share we measure compensation expense based on the grant date fair value net of estimated forfeiture for award settled in cash or that may be settled in cash we measure compensation expense based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeiture the expense is recognized over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period of the award income taxesprovisions for federal state and local and non income tax are calculated on reported loss before income tax based on current tax law and also include in the current period the cumulative effect of any change in tax rate from those used previously in determining deferred tax asset and liability such provision differ from the amount currently receivable or payable because certain item of income and expense are recognized in different time period for financial reporting purpose than for income tax purpose significant judgment is required in determining income tax provision and evaluating tax position the accounting for uncertainty in income tax requires more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return we record liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purpose and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return to the extent that our assessment of such tax position change the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made tax related interest and penalty are classified component of income tax expense benefit we also ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset against future source of taxable income and reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax asset by recording valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that all or portion of such asset will not be realized change in our estimate and judgment regarding realization of deferred tax asset may result in an increase or decrease to our tax expense and or other comprehensive income which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs postretirement plansmany of our employee have earned benefit under defined benefit pension plan the majority of employee that had participated in defined benefit pension plan have transitioned to company funded defined contribution retirement saving plan we also provide postretirement benefit plan other than pension consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retiree and qualifying dependent benefit under the pension and other postretirement benefit plan are generally based on age at retirement and year of service and for some pension plan benefit are also based on the employee annual earnings the net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plan is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumption the most significant of which are the discount rate the long term rate of asset return and medical trend rate of growth for medical cost actuarial gain and loss which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumption are reflected in shareholder equity net of tax if actuarial gain and loss exceed ten percent of the greater of plan asset or plan liability we amortize them over the average expected future lifetime of participant the funded status of our pension and postretirement plan is reflected on the consolidated statement of financial position of contentspostemployment planswe record liability for postemployment benefit such severance or job training when payment is probable the amount is reasonably estimable and the obligation relates to right that have vested or accumulated environmental remediationwe are subject to federal and state requirement for protection of the environment including those for discharge of hazardous material and remediation of contaminated site we routinely ass based on in depth study expert analysis and legal review our contingency obligation and commitment for remediation of contaminated site including assessment of range and probability of recovery from other responsible party and or insurance carrier our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposure related to environmental remediation site when it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated the amount of the liability is based on our best estimate or the low end of range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation cleanup and monitoring cost to be incurred estimated remediation cost are not discounted to present value the timing of payment can not be reasonably estimated we may be able to recover portion of the remediation cost from insurer or other third party such recovery are recorded when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable cash and cash equivalentscash and cash equivalent consist of highly liquid instrument such commercial paper time deposit and other money market instrument which have original maturity of three month or le we aggregate our cash balance by bank where condition for right of set off are met and reclassify any negative balance consisting mainly of uncleared check to account payable negative balance reclassified to account payable were and at december and inventoriesinventoried cost on commercial aircraft program and long term contract include direct engineering production and tooling and other non recurring cost and applicable overhead which includes fringe benefit production related indirect and plant management salary and plant service not in excess of estimated net realizable value to the extent material amount of such cost are related to an abnormal event or are fixed cost not appropriately attributable to our program or contract they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried inventoried cost include amount relating to program and contract with long term production cycle portion of which is not expected to be realized within one year included in inventory for federal government contract is an allocation of allowable cost related to manufacturing process reengineering commercial aircraft program inventory includes deferred production cost and supplier advance deferred production cost represent actual cost incurred for production of early unit that exceed the estimated average cost of all unit in the program accounting quantity higher production cost are experienced at the beginning of new or derivative aircraft program unit produced early in program require substantially more effort labor and other resource than unit produced later in program because of volume efficiency and the effect of learning we expect that these deferred cost will be fully recovered when all unit included in the accounting quantity are delivered the expected unit cost for later delivery is below the estimated average cost of all unit in the program supplier advance represent payment for part we have contracted to receive from supplier in the future part are received supplier advance are amortized to work in process the determination of net realizable value of long term contract cost is based upon quarterly review that estimate cost to be incurred to complete all contract requirement when actual contract cost and of contentsthe estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenue loss provision is recorded the determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program cost is based upon quarterly program review that estimate revenue and cost to be incurred to complete the program accounting quantity when estimated cost to complete exceed estimated program revenue to go program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered unit in the accounting quantity used aircraft purchased by the commercial airplane segment and general stock material are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value spare part inventory is stated at lower of average unit cost or net realizable value we review our commercial spare part and general stock material quarterly to identify impaired inventory including excess or obsolete inventory based on historical sale trend expected production usage and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part impaired inventory are charged to cost of product in the period the impairment occurs included in inventory for commercial aircraft program are amount paid or credited in cash or other consideration to certain airline customer that are referred to early issue sale consideration early issue sale consideration is recognized reduction to revenue when the delivery of the aircraft under contract occurs if an airline customer doe not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft we believe that we would have the ability to recover amount paid however to the extent early issue sale consideration exceeds advance and is not considered to be otherwise recoverable it would be written off in the current period precontract costswe may from time to time incur cost in excess of the amount required for existing contract if we determine the cost are probable of recovery from future order we capitalize the precontract cost we incur excluding start up cost which are expensed incurred capitalized precontract cost are included in inventory in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position should future order not materialize or we determine the cost are no longer probable of recovery the capitalized cost would be written off property plant and equipmentproperty plant and equipment are recorded at cost including applicable construction period interest le accumulated depreciation and are depreciated principally over the following estimated useful life new building and land improvement from to year and new machinery and equipment from to year the principal method of depreciation are follows building and land improvement declining balance and machinery and equipment sum of the year digit capitalized internal use software is included in other asset and amortized using the straight line method over year capitalized software service is included in other asset and amortized using the straight line method over the term of the hosting arrangement which is typically no greater than year we periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable life assigned to long lived asset including asset that may be subject to management plan for disposition long lived asset held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value le cost to sell long lived asset held for use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flow of the asset the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset lease we determine if an arrangement is or contains lease under which we are the lessee at the inception date operating lease asset are included in other asset with the related liability included in accrued liability and other long term liability asset under finance lease which primarily represent computer equipment are included in property plant and equipment net with the related of contentsliabilities included in short term debt and current portion of long term debt and long term debt on the consolidated statement of financial position operating lease asset represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liability represent our obligation to make lease payment arising from the lease operating lease asset and liability are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payment over the lease term we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payment variable component of the lease payment such fair market value adjustment utility and maintenance cost are expensed incurred and not included in determining the present value our lease term include option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option lease expense for operating lease is recognized on straight line basis over the lease term we have real property lease agreement with lease and non lease component which are accounted for single lease component asset retirement obligationswe record all known asset retirement obligation for which the liability fair value can be reasonably estimated including certain asbestos removal asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligation recorded amount are not material we also have known conditional asset retirement obligation such certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activity to be performed in the future that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation accordingly these obligation have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statement liability for these obligation will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make reasonable estimate of the liability fair value in addition there may be conditional asset retirement obligation that we have not yet discovered asbestos may exist in certain building but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business and therefore these obligation also have not been included in the consolidated financial statement goodwill and other acquired intangiblesgoodwill and other acquired intangible asset with indefinite life are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstance change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist our annual testing date is april we test goodwill for impairment by performing qualitative assessment or using quantitative test if we choose to perform qualitative assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net asset is more than the fair value of the related operation the quantitative test is then performed otherwise no further testing is required for operation where the quantitative test is used we compare the carrying value of net asset to the estimated fair value of the related operation if the fair value is determined to be le than carrying value the shortfall up to the carrying value of the goodwill represents the amount of goodwill impairment indefinite lived intangible consist of brand and trade name and in process research and development ipr acquired in business combination ipr is initially capitalized at fair value an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter ipr is reclassified to finite lived acquired intangible asset when project is completed and then amortized on straight line basis over the asset estimated useful life we test these intangible for impairment by comparing the carrying value to current projection of related discounted cash flow any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flow represents the amount of the impairment of contentsour finite lived acquired intangible asset are amortized on straight line basis over their estimated useful life follows developed technology from to year product know how from to year customer base from to year distribution right from to year and other from to year we evaluate the potential impairment of finite lived acquired intangible asset whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flow of the asset the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset investmentstime deposit are held to maturity investment that are carried at cost available for sale debt security include commercial paper government agency security and corporate debt security available for sale debt security are recorded at fair value and unrealized gain and loss are recorded net of tax component of accumulated other comprehensive income realized gain and loss on available for sale debt security are recognized based on the specific identification method available for sale debt security are assessed for impairment quarterly the equity method of accounting is used to account for investment for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over an investee significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between and the cumulative earnings approach is used for cash flow classification of distribution received from equity method investment other equity investment are recorded at fair value with gain and loss recorded through net earnings equity investment without readily determinable fair value are measured at cost le impairment plus or minus observable price change equity investment without readily determinable fair value are assessed for impairment quarterly we classify investment income and loss on our consolidated statement of operation based on whether the investment is operating or non operating in nature operating investment align strategically and are integrated with our operation earnings from operating investment including our share of income or loss from equity method investment dividend income from other equity investment and any impairment or gain loss on the disposition of these investment are recorded in loss income from operating investment net non operating investment are those we hold for non strategic purpose earnings from non operating investment including interest and dividend on marketable security and any impairment or gain loss on the disposition of these investment are recorded in other income net derivativesall derivative instrument are recognized in the financial statement and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them we use derivative instrument to principally manage variety of market risk for our cash flow hedge the derivative gain or loss is initially reported in comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affect earnings we have agreement to purchase and sell aluminum to address long term strategic sourcing objective and non business requirement we also hold certain other derivative instrument for economic purpose these aluminum purchase and sale agreement and other derivative instrument are derivative for accounting purpose but are not designated hedge for accounting purpose for these aluminum agreement and other derivative instrument not designated for hedge accounting treatment the change in their fair value are recorded in earnings immediately of contentsallowances for loss on certain financial assetswe establish allowance for credit loss on account receivable unbilled receivables customer financing receivables and certain other financial asset the adequacy of these allowance is assessed quarterly through consideration of factor such customer credit rating bankruptcy filing published or estimated credit default rate age of the receivable expected loss rate and collateral exposure collateral exposure is the excess of the carrying value of financial asset over the fair value of the related collateral we determine the creditworthiness of our customer by assigning internal credit rating based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from the customer our rating category are comparable to those used by major credit rating agency customer financing receivables are collateralized by security in the related asset we use median calculated from published collateral value from multiple third party aircraft value publication based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft collateral under certain circumstance we apply judgment based on the attribute of the specific aircraft or equipment usually when the feature or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attribute covered by outside publication we have entered into agreement with certain customer that would entitle to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable for purpose of determining the collateral exposure should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable creating shortfall condition these agreement would for example permit to take the action necessary to sell or retain certain other asset in which the customer ha an equity interest and use the proceeds to cover the shortfall commercial aircraft trade in commitment in conjunction with signing definitive agreement for the sale of new commercial aircraft sale aircraft we have entered into trade in commitment with certain customer that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at specified price exposure related to trade in commitment may take the form of adjustment to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of the fair value of the trade in

during the year ended december we increased the reach forward loss on the kc tanker program by primarily reflecting higher production and supply chain cost partially driven by labor instability and supply chain disruption most of which wa recorded during the third quarter of the increase in production cost wa primarily driven by factory unit time performance expectation that assume continued

probable of being exercised the first production and support contract option is expected to be exercised in we increased the estimated reach forward loss by during the year ended december primarily driven by ongoing supply chain negotiation which are impacted by supply chain constraint and inflationary pressure and design revision well an increase in the number of expected unit in the initial
