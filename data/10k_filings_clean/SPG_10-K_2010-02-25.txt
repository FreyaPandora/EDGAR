equipment the cost of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substance may be substantial and could adversely affect our result of operation or financial condition but is not estimable the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may also adversely affect our ability to sell lease or redevelop property or to borrow using property collateral our effort to identify environmental liability may not be successful although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with federal state and local environmental law ordinance and regulation regarding hazardous or toxic substance this belief is based on limited testing nearly all of our property have been subjected to phase or similar environmental audit these environmental audit have not revealed are we aware of any environmental liability that we believe will have material adverse effect on our result of operation or financial condition however we can not assure you that existing environmental study with respect to the portfolio reveal all potential environmental liability any previous owner occupant or tenant of property not create any material environmental

tenant may be entitled to modify the term of their existing lease in the event of such closure the modification could be unfavorable to the lessor and could decrease rent or expense recovery charge additionally major tenant closure may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sale at other store if the sale of store operating in our property were to decline significantly due to closing of anchor economic condition or other reason tenant may be unable to pay their minimum rent or expense recovery charge in the event of default by tenant or anchor store we

administrative property and liability insurance cost and security cost we historically have used lease with variable cam provision that adjust to reflect inflationary increase we have made concerted effort to convert our lease to fixed payment methodology which fix our tenant cam contribution and should in turn reduce the volatility of and limitation on the recovery we collect from our tenant for the reimbursement of our property operating expense however with respect to both variable and fixed payment methodology the amount of cam charge we bill to our tenant may not allow to recover all of these operating cost we face wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably our property compete with other retail property and other form of retailing such catalog and commerce website competition may come from regional mall outlet center community lifestyle center and other shopping center both existing well future development project the presence of competitive

accounting policy including making estimate and assumption we base our estimate on historical experience and on various other assumption believed to be reasonable under the circumstance these judgment affect the reported amount of asset and liability disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period if our judgment or interpretation of the fact and circumstance relating to various transaction had been different it is possible that different accounting policy would have been applied resulting in different presentation of our financial statement from time to time we evaluate our estimate and assumption in the event estimate or assumption prove to be different from actual result adjustment are made in subsequent period to reflect more current information below is discussion of accounting policy that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in

retain substantially all of the risk and benefit of ownership of the investment property and account for our lease operating lease we accrue minimum rent on straight line basis over the term of their respective lease substantially all of our retail tenant are also required to pay overage rent based on sale over stated base amount during the lease year we recognize overage rent only when each tenant sale exceed it sale threshold we review investment property for impairment on property by property basis whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of investment

investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization plus it residual value is le than the carrying value of the property to the extent impairment ha occurred we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over it estimated fair value we may decide to sell property that are held for use and the sale price of these property may differ from their carrying value we also review our investment including investment in unconsolidated entity if event or circumstance change indicating that the carrying amount of our investment may not be recoverable we will record an impairment charge if we determine that decline in the fair value of the investment below carrying value is other than temporary to maintain our status reit we must distribute at least of our taxable income in any given year and meet certain asset and income test we monitor our business and transaction that may potentially impact management discussion and

to be taxed reit for four year unless our failure wa due to reasonable cause and certain other condition were met result failing to maintain reit status would result in significant increase in the income tax expense recorded during those period we make estimate part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisition to the various component of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component the most significant component of our allocation are typically the allocation of fair value to the building if vacant land and market value of in place lease in the case of the fair value of building and the allocation of value to land and other intangible our estimate of the value of these component will affect the amount of depreciation we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of the market value of in place lease we make our best estimate of the tenant ability to pay rent based upon the tenant operating performance at the property including the competitive position of the property in it market well sale psf rent psf and overall occupancy cost for the tenant in place at the acquisition date our assumption affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in place lease variety of cost are incurred in the development and leasing of property after determination is made to capitalize cost it is allocated to the specific component of project that is benefited determination of when development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves degree of judgment the cost of land and building under development include specifically identifiable cost the capitalized cost include pre construction cost essential to the development of the property development cost construction cost interest cost real estate tax salary and related cost and other cost incurred during the period of development we

the effect of nonrecurring item not classified extraordinary cumulative effect of accounting change or gain or loss resulting from the sale of previously depreciated operating property we include in ffo gain and loss realized from the sale of land outlot building marketable and non marketable security and investment holding of non retail real estate however you should understand that our computation of ffo might not be comparable to ffo reported by other reit and that ffo doe not represent cash flow from operation defined by gaap should not be considered an alternative to consolidated
