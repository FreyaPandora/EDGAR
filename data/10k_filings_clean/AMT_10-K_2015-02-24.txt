discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation and note to our consolidated financial statement included in this annual report product and service rental and management operation our rental and management operation accounted for approximately and of our total revenue for the year ended december and respectively our revenue is primarily generated from tenant lease our tenant lease space on our communication real estate where they install and maintain individual communication network equipment rental payment vary considerably depending upon numerous factor including but not limited to tower location amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower ground space required by the tenant and remaining tower capacity our tenant lease are typically non cancellable and have annual rent escalation our primary cost typically include ground rent which is primarily fixed with annual cost escalation and power and fuel cost of which may be passed through to our tenant well property tax and repair and maintenance our rental and management operation have generated consistent incremental growth in revenue and have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristic consistent demand for our site result of rapidly growing usage of wireless service and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trend in the market we serve we anticipate consistent demand for our communication site we believe that our global asset base position well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless device and the increasing usage of high bandwidth application on those device we have the ability to add new tenant and new equipment for existing tenant on our site which typically result in incremental revenue our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide with solid platform for new business opportunity which ha historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth long term tenant lease with contractual rent escalation in general tenant lease ha an initial non cancellable ten year term with multiple renewal term with provision that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically annually based on fixed escalation percentage approximately in the united state or an inflationary index in our international market or combination of high lease renewal rate our tenant tend to renew lease suitable alternative site may not exist or be available and repositioning site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect the quality of their network historically churn ha been approximately to of total rental and management revenue per year we define churn revenue lost when tenant cancel or not renew it lease and in limited circumstance such tenant bankruptcy reduction in lease rate on existing lease we derive our churn rate for given year by dividing our cash revenue lost on this basis by our comparable year ago period cash rental and management segment revenue high operating margin incremental operating cost associated with adding new tenant to an existing communication site are relatively minimal therefore tenant are added the substantial majority of incremental revenue flow through to operating profit in addition in many of our international market certain expense such ground rent or fuel cost are passed through and shared across our tenant base low maintenance capital expenditure on average we require relatively low amount of annual capital expenditure to maintain our communication site our rental and management operation include the operation of communication tower managed network the leasing of property interest and the provision of backup power through shared generator our domestic rental and management segment accounted for approximately and of our total revenue for the year ended december and respectively table of content our international rental and management segment which consists of

we grant right to wireless service provider to attach their equipment to our installation we also offer outdoor da network complementary shared infrastructure solution for our tenant in the united state typically we design build and operate our outdoor da network in area in which zoning restriction or other barrier may prevent or delay deployment of more traditional wireless communication site we also hold lease right and easement interest on rooftop capable of hosting communication equipment in location where tower are generally not viable solution based on area characteristic in addition we provide management service to property owner in the united state elect to retain full right to their property while simultaneously marketing the rooftop for wireless communication equipment

service through our network development service we offer tower related service domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting service and structural analysis service network development service primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenant and equipment on our site including in connection with provider network upgrade this segment accounted for approximately and of our total revenue for the year ended december and respectively site acquisition zoning and permitting we engage in site acquisition service on our own behalf in connection with our tower development project well on behalf of our tenant we typically work with our tenant engineer to determine the geographic area where new communication site will best address the tenant need and meet their coverage objective new site is identified we acquire the right to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approval are obtained to construct and operate the communication site structural analysis we offer structural analysis service to wireless carrier in connection with the installation of their communication equipment on our tower our team of engineer evaluate whether tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed which enables our tenant to better ass potential site making an installation decision our structural analysis capability enable to provide higher quality service to our existing tenant by among other thing reducing the time required to achieve operational readiness while also providing opportunity to offer structural analysis service to third party strategy operational strategy our operational strategy is to capitalize on the global growth in the use of wireless communication service and the evolution of advanced wireless handset tablet and other mobile device and the corresponding expansion of communication infrastructure required to deploy current and future generation of wireless communication technology to achieve this our primary focus is to increase the leasing of our existing communication real estate portfolio ii invest in and selectively grow our communication real estate portfolio iii improve upon our operational performance and iv maintain strong balance sheet we believe these effort will further support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure increase the leasing of our existing communication real estate portfolio we believe that our highest return will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communication site increasing demand for wireless service in the united state and in our international market ha resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carrier result we anticipate consistent demand for our communication site because they are attractively located for wireless service provider and have capacity available for additional tenant in the united state incremental carrier capital spending is driven primarily by the build of fourth generation network while our international market are in various stage of network development of december we global average of approximately tenant per tower we believe that many of our tower have capacity for additional tenant and that substantially all of our tower that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment therefore we will continue to target our sale and marketing activity to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communication site table of content invest in and selectively grow our communication real estate portfolio we seek opportunity to invest in and grow our operation through our capital program new site construction and acquisition we believe we can achieve attractive risk adjusted return by pursuing such investment in addition we seek to secure property interest under our communication site to improve operating margin we reduce our cash operating expense related to ground lease further improve upon our operational performance we will continue to seek opportunity to improve our operational performance throughout the organization this includes investing in our system and people we strive to improve our efficiency and provide superior service to our customer to achieve this we intend to continue to focus on customer service such reducing cycle time for key function including lease processing and tower structural analysis maintain strong balance sheet we remain committed to our disciplined financial policy which we believe result in our ability to maintain strong balance sheet and will support our overall strategy and focus on asset growth and operational excellence result of these policy we currently have investment grade rating we remain committed to reducing our net leverage through combination of debt repayment and our continued growth we continue to focus on maintaining strong liquidity position and of december had approximately billion of available liquidity we believe that our investment grade rating provide consistent access to the capital market and our liquidity provides the ability to selectively invest in our portfolio capital allocation strategy the objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted fund from operation and our return on invested capital to maintain our qualification for taxation reit we are required to distribute to our stockholder annually an amount equal to at least of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain complying with our reit distribution requirement and paying dividend on our preferred stock we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternative that meet our return on investment criterion while taking into account the repayment of debt necessary to reduce our net leverage to be within our long term target range capital expenditure program we will continue to invest in and expand our existing communication real estate portfolio through our annual capital expenditure program this includes capital expenditure associated with maintenance increasing the capacity of our existing site and project such new site construction land interest acquisition and shared generator installation acquisition we intend to pursue acquisition of communication site in our existing or new market where we can meet our risk adjusted return on investment criterion our risk adjusted hurdle rate consider additional risk such the country and counter party involved investment and economic climate legal and regulatory condition and industry risk return excess capital to stockholder if we have excess capital available after funding our required distribution ii our capital expenditure iii repayment of debt necessary to reduce our net leverage ratio toward our targeted range and iv anticipated future investment including acquisition opportunity we will seek to return such excess capital to stockholder during we generated billion of cash from operating activity which along with incremental debt wa used to fund billion of investment including billion of acquisition and million of capital expenditure in addition in we paid regular cash distribution in the aggregate of approximately million to our common stockholder and approximately million to our preferred stockholder international growth strategy we believe that in certain international market we can create substantial value by either establishing new or expanding our existing communication real estate leasing business therefore we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunity where we believe our risk adjusted return objective can be table of content achieved we strive to maintain diversified approach to our international growth strategy by complementing our presence in emerging market with operation in more developed and established market which enables to leverage multiple stage of wireless network development throughout our global footprint our international growth strategy includes disciplined individualized market evaluation in which we conduct the following analysis country analysis prior to entering new market we conduct an extensive review of the country historical and projected macroeconomic fundamental including inflation outlook and foreign currency exchange rate trend capital market tax regime and investment alternative and the general business political and legal environment including property right and regulatory regime wireless industry analysis to confirm the presence of sufficient demand to support an independent tower company we analyze the competitiveness of the country wireless market such the pricing environment past and potential industry consolidation and the stage of it wireless network development characteristic that result in an attractive investment opportunity include multiple competitive wireless service provider who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data network and ii incremental spectrum from auction that have occurred or are anticipated to occur is being or will be deployed opportunity and counterparty analysis once an investment opportunity is identified within geographic area with an attractive wireless industry we conduct multifaceted opportunity and counterparty analysis this includes evaluating the type of transaction ii it ability to meet our risk adjusted return criterion given the country and the counterparties involved including the anticipated anchor tenant and iii how the transaction fit within our long term strategic objective including future potential investment and expansion within the region recent transaction acquisition from january through december we increased our communication site portfolio by approximately site including approximately build to suit and we believe the asset constructed and acquired will be accretive to our consolidated operating margin significant acquisition during the year ended december included the acquisition of of the equity interest of br tower brazilian telecommunication real estate company br tower which at closing owned or held exclusive use right for tower and property interest in brazil and ii entity holding

llc and other related entity richland in addition during the fourth quarter of we signed definitive agreement to acquire approximately additional communication site in brazil and nigeria and in february we signed definitive agreement for the proposed verizon transaction to acquire the exclusive right to lease acquire or otherwise operate and manage up to wireless communication site in the united state we continue to evaluate potential complementary service to supplement our growth and expansion strategy well opportunity to acquire communication real estate portfolio that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing business for more information about our acquisition see note to our consolidated financial statement included in this annual report financing transaction during the year ended december to complement our operational strategy to selectively invest in and grow our communication real estate portfolio we strengthened our balance sheet by completing number of table of content key financing initiative including those set forth for more information about our financing transaction see item of this annual report under the caption management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation liquidity and capital resource and note to our consolidated financial statement included in this annual report senior note offering in january

maturity date to january result of december we had the ability to borrow up to billion under our existing credit facility net of any outstanding letter of credit regulatory matter tower and antenna our domestic and international tower business is subject to national state and local regulatory requirement with respect to the registration siting construction lighting marking and maintenance of our tower in the united state which accounted for approximately of our total rental and management revenue for the year ended december the construction of new tower or modification to existing tower may require pre approval by the federal communication commission fcc and the federal aviation administration faa depending on factor such tower height and proximity to public airfield tower requiring pre approval must be registered with the fcc and maintained in accordance with faa standard similar requirement regarding pre approval of the construction and modification of tower are imposed by regulator in other country non compliance with applicable tower related requirement may lead to monetary penalty or site deconstruction order furthermore in india each of our subsidiary hold an infrastructure provider category license ip issued by the indian ministry of communication and information technology which permit to provide tower space to company licensed telecommunication service provider under the indian telegraph act of condition to the ip the indian government ha the right to take over telecommunication infrastructure in the case of emergency or war in ghana our subsidiary hold communication infrastructure license issued by the national communication authority nca which permit to establish and maintain passive telecommunication infrastructure service and da network for communication service provider licensed by the nca while we are required to provide tower space on non discriminatory basis we may negotiate mutually agreeable term and condition with such service provider in chile our subsidiary is classified telecom intermediate service provider we have received number of site specific concession and are working with the chilean subsecretaria de telecommunicaciones to receive concession on our remaining site in chile our international business operation may be subject to increased licensing fee or ownership restriction for example in south africa the broad based black economic empowerment act the bbbee act table of content ha established legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of south african citizen disadvantaged by apartheid accordingly the bbbee act and related code measure bbbee act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership management control employment equity and other metric for company that do business there in addition certain municipality have sought to impose permit fee based upon structural or operational requirement of tower our foreign operation may be affected if country regulatory authority restricts or revoke spectrum license of certain wireless service provider or implement limitation on foreign ownership in all country where we operate we are subject to zoning restriction and restrictive covenant imposed by local authority or community organization while these regulation vary they typically require tower owner or tenant to obtain approval from local authority or community standard organization prior to tower construction or the addition of new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authority and community resident often oppose construction in their community which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade project thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand in addition zoning regulation can increase cost associated with new tower construction tower modification and addition of new antenna to site or site upgrade existing regulatory policy may adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such project and additional regulation may be adopted that cause delay or result in additional cost to these factor could materially and adversely affect our construction activity and operation in the united state the telecommunication act of prohibits any action by state and local authority that would discriminate different provider of wireless service or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communication site it also prohibits state or local restriction based on the environmental effect of radio frequency emission to the extent the facility comply with fcc regulation further in february the united state government adopted regulation requiring that local and state government approve modification or collocation that qualify eligible facility under the regulation portion of our business are subject to additional regulation for example in number of state throughout the united state certain of our subsidiary hold competitive local exchange carrier clec or other status in connection with the operation of our outdoor da network business in addition we or our domestic and international tenant may be subject to new regulatory policy in certain jurisdiction from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communication site environmental matter our domestic and international operation are subject to various national state and local environmental law and regulation including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and non hazardous substance material and waste and the siting of our tower we may be required to obtain permit pay additional property tax comply with regulatory requirement and make certain informational filing related to hazardous substance or device used to provide power such battery generator and fuel at our site violation of these type of regulation could subject to fine or criminal sanction additionally in the united state and many other international market where we do business before constructing new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impact in an environmental assessment if tower or new antenna might have material adverse impact on the environment fcc or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed health and safety in the united state and in other country where we operate we are subject to various national state and local law regarding employee health and safety including protection from radio frequency exposure table of content competition we compete both for new business and for the acquisition of asset with other public tower company such crown castle international corp sba communication corporation and gtl infrastructure limited wireless carrier tower consortium such indus tower and private tower company independent wireless carrier tower owner broadcaster and owner of non communication site including rooftop utility tower water tower and other alternative structure we believe that site location and capacity network density price quality and speed of service have been and will continue to be significant competitive factor affecting owner operator and manager of communication site our network development service business competes with variety of company offering individual or combination of competing service the field of competitor includes site acquisition consultant zoning consultant real estate firm right of way consultant structural engineering firm tower owner manager telecommunication equipment vendor who can provide turnkey site development service through multiple subcontractor and our tenant personnel we believe that our tenant base their decision for network development service on various criterion including company experience local reputation price and time for completion of project customer demand our strategy is predicated on the belief that wireless service provider will continue to invest in the coverage quality and capacity of their network in both our domestic and international market driving demand for our communication site domestic wireless network investment according to industry data aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the united state ha averaged over billion over the past three year resulting in consistent demand for our site demand for our domestic communication site is driven by increasing wireless data usage which continues to incentivize wireless service provider to focus on network quality and make incremental investment in the coverage and capacity of their network subscriber adoption of advanced wireless data application such mobile internet and video increasingly advanced device and the corresponding deployment and densification of advanced network by wireless service provider to satisfy this incremental demand for high bandwidth wireless data deployment of newly acquired spectrum and deployment of wireless and backhaul network by new market entrant consumer demand for and use of advanced wireless service in the united state grow wireless service provider may be compelled to deploy new technology and equipment further increase the cell density of their existing network and expand their network coverage international wireless network investment the wireless network in most of our international market are typically le advanced those in our domestic market with respect to the density of voice network and the current technology generally deployed for wireless service accordingly demand for our international communication site is primarily driven by incumbent wireless service provider investing in existing voice network to improve or expand their coverage and increase capacity in certain of our international market increasing subscriber adoption of wireless data application such email internet and video spectrum auction which result in new market entrant well initial and incremental data network deployment and the increasing availability of lower cost smartphones internationally table of content we believe demand for our communication site will continue wireless service provider seek to increase the quality coverage area and capacity of their existing network while also investing in next generation data network to meet these network objective we believe wireless carrier will continue to outsource their communication site infrastructure need mean to accelerate network development and more efficiently use their capital rather than construct and operate their own communication site and maintain their own communication site operation and development capability in addition because our network development service are complementary to our rental and management business we believe demand for our network development service will continue consistent with industry trend any increase in the use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangement by wireless service provider could adversely affect customer demand for tower space these arrangement enable provider to serve it customer outside the provider license area to give licensed provider the right to enter into arrangement to serve overlapping license area and to permit non licensed provider to enter the wireless marketplace consolidation among wireless carrier could similarly impact customer demand for our communication site because the existing network of wireless carrier often overlap in addition wireless carrier sharing their site or permitting equipment location swapping on their site with other carrier to significant degree could reduce demand for our communication site further our tenant may be subject to new regulatory policy from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communication site in addition our customer demand could be adversely affected by the emergence and growth of new technology which could make it possible for wireless carrier to increase the capacity and efficiency of their existing network without the need for incremental cell site the increased use of spectrally efficient technology or the availability of significant incremental spectrum in the marketplace could potentially relieve portion of our tenant network capacity problem and result could reduce the demand for tower based antenna space additionally certain complementary network technology such small cell deployment could shift portion of our tenant network investment away from the traditional tower based network which may reduce the need for carrier to add more equipment at certain communication site employee of december we employed full time individual and consider our employee relation to be satisfactory available information our internet website

boston massachusetts attention investor relation or by calling at item risk factor decrease in demand for our communication site would materially and adversely affect our operating result and we can not control that demand factor affecting the demand for our communication site and to lesser extent our network development service could materially and adversely affect our operating result those factor include increased use of network sharing without compensation to roaming or resale arrangement by wireless service provider merger or consolidation among wireless service provider zoning environmental health or other government regulation or change in the application and enforcement thereof governmental licensing of spectrum or restricting or revoking spectrum license decrease in consumer demand for wireless service due to general economic condition or other factor including inflation the ability and willingness of wireless service provider to maintain or increase capital expenditure on network infrastructure the financial condition of wireless service provider delay or change in the deployment of next generation wireless technology and technological change any downturn in the economy or disruption in the financial and credit market could impact consumer demand for wireless service if wireless service subscriber significantly reduce their minute of use or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data application our wireless service provider tenant could experience decrease in demand for their service result our tenant may scale back their capital expenditure plan which could materially and adversely affect leasing demand for our communication site and our network development service business which could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation or financial condition if our tenant share site infrastructure to significant degree or consolidate or merge our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flow could be materially and adversely affected extensive sharing of site infrastructure roaming or resale arrangement among wireless service provider an alternative to leasing our communication site without compensation to may cause new lease activity to slow if carrier utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing site because portion of the tenant network may become redundant in addition significant consolidation among our tenant may materially and adversely affect our growth and revenue certain combined company have rationalized duplicative part of their network or modernized their network and these and other tenant could determine not to renew lease with result our ongoing contractual revenue and our future result may be negatively impacted if significant number of these lease are not renewed increasing competition for tenant in the tower industry may materially and adversely affect our pricing our industry is highly competitive and our tenant have numerous alternative in leasing antenna space competitive pricing for tenant on tower from competitor could materially and adversely affect our lease rate table of content we may not be able to renew existing tenant lease or enter into new tenant lease or if we are able to renew or enter new lease it may be at rate lower than our current rate resulting in material adverse impact on our result of operation and growth rate in addition should inflation rate exceed our fixed escalator percentage in market where the majority of our lease include fixed escalator our income would be adversely affected increasing competition for tenant or significant increase in inflation rate could materially and adversely affect our business result of operation or financial condition competition for asset could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criterion we may experience increased competition which could make the acquisition of high quality asset significantly more costly some of our competitor are larger and may have greater financial resource than we do while other competitor may apply lower investment criterion than we do in addition we may not anticipate increased competition entering particular market or competing for the asset higher price for asset could make it more difficult to achieve our return on investment criterion which could materially and adversely affect our business result of operation or financial condition our business is subject to government regulation and change in current or future law or regulation could restrict our ability to operate our business we currently do our business and that of our tenant are subject to federal state local and foreign regulation in certain jurisdiction these regulation could be applied or enforced retroactively which could require that we modify or dismantle an existing tower zoning authority and community organization are often opposed to the construction in their community which can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction modification addition of new antenna to site or site upgrade thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand and requirement in addition in certain foreign jurisdiction we are required to pay annual license fee and these fee may be subject to substantial increase by the government foreign jurisdiction in which we operate and currently are not required to pay license fee may enact license fee which may apply retroactively in certain foreign jurisdiction there may be change to zoning regulation or construction law based on site location which may result in increased cost to modify certain of our existing tower or decreased revenue due to the removal of certain tower to ensure compliance with such change existing regulatory policy may materially and adversely affect the associated timing or cost of construction project associated with our communication site and additional regulation may be adopted that increase delay or result in additional cost to or that prevent such project in certain location furthermore the tax law regulation and interpretation governing reit may change at any time perhaps with retroactive effect in addition some of these change could have more significant impact on compared to other reit due to the nature of our business and our use of trss these factor could materially and adversely affect our business result of operation or financial condition furthermore some foreign jurisdiction have implemented regulation governing investment fund or their manager which may be interpreted to apply to reit and there is uncertainty to the interpretation and implementation of these regulation our leverage and debt service obligation may materially and adversely affect our leverage could render unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amount due with respect to our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restriction under our existing indebtedness to draw on our credit facility and obtain additional long term debt and working capital line of credit to meet future financing need our leverage could have significant negative consequence to our business result of operation or financial condition including impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenant contained in our debt agreement or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under those agreement which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt and the loss of the tower securing such debt if an uncured default occurs table of content increasing our borrowing cost if our current investment grade debt rating decline placing at possible competitive disadvantage to le leveraged competitor and competitor that may have better access to capital resource including with respect to acquiring asset limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing thereby increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry condition requiring the dedication of substantial portion of our cash flow from operation to service our debt thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purpose including capital expenditure reit distribution and preferred stock dividend requiring to issue debt or equity security or to sell some of our core asset possibly on unfavorable term to meet payment obligation limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to change in our business and the market in which we compete and limiting our ability to repurchase our common stock or make distribution to our stockholder in addition to meet the reit distribution requirement and maintain our qualification and taxation reit we may need to borrow fund even if the prevailing market condition are not favorable and the reit distribution requirement may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditure future growth and expansion initiative this would increase our total leverage failure to successfully and efficiently integrate acquired or leased asset including from the proposed verizon transaction the verizon asset into our operation may adversely affect our business operation and financial condition integrating acquired portfolio of communication site may require significant resource well attention from our management team in addition we may incur certain non recurring charge associated with the integration of acquired or leased asset or business into our operation further the significant acquisition related integration cost could materially and adversely affect our result of operation in the period in which such charge are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related cost are actually paid for example the integration of the verizon asset which includes up to tower into our operation will be significant undertaking and we anticipate that we will incur certain non recurring charge associated with the integration of the verizon asset into our operation including cost for task such tower visit and audit and ground and tenant lease verification additional integration challenge include transitioning all data related to the verizon asset tenant and landlord to common information technology system successfully marketing space on the verizon asset successfully transitioning the ground lease rent payment and the tenant billing and collection process retaining existing tenant on the verizon asset and maintaining our standard control procedure and policy with respect to the verizon asset additionally we may fail to successfully integrate the asset we acquire or fail to utilize such asset to their full capacity if we are not able to meet these integration challenge we may not realize the benefit we expect from our acquired portfolio and business including the proposed verizon transaction and our business financial condition and result of operation will be adversely affected table of content our expansion initiative involve number of risk and uncertainty that could adversely affect our operating result disrupt our operation or expose to additional risk we continue to acquire communication site in our existing market and expand into new market we are subject to number of risk and uncertainty including not meeting our return on investment criterion and financial objective increased cost assumed liability and the diversion of managerial attention due to acquisition achieving the benefit of acquisition depends in part on timely and efficiently integrating operation communication tower portfolio and personnel integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reason including among other thing differing system and process cultural difference customary business practice and conflicting policy procedure and operation in addition integrating business may significantly burden management and internal resource including the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel furthermore our international expansion initiative are subject to additional risk such those described in the risk factor immediately below some of which may require additional resource and personnel in addition result of prior acquisition we have substantial amount of intangible asset and goodwill in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state gaap we are required to ass our goodwill and other intangible asset annually or more frequently in the event of circumstance indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired if the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable we are required to record non cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the estimated fair value of other intangible asset in the period the determination is made our expansion initiative may not be successful or we may be required to record impairment charge for our goodwill or for other intangible asset which could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation or financial condition our foreign operation are subject to economic political and other risk that could materially and adversely affect our revenue or financial position including risk associated with fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate our international business operation and our expansion into new market in the future could result in adverse financial consequence and operational problem not typically experienced in the united state we anticipate that our revenue from our international operation will continue to grow accordingly our business is subject to risk associated with business internationally including change to existing or new tax law or methodology impacting our international operation or fee directed specifically at the ownership and operation of communication site or our international acquisition any of which may be applied or enforced retroactively law or regulation that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other fund or otherwise limit distribution of capital change in specific country or region political or economic condition including inflation or

increase in the cost of labor result of unionization or otherwise power and other good and service required for our operation price setting or other similar law for the sharing of passive infrastructure and uncertain or inconsistent law regulation ruling or result from legal or judicial system which may be enforced retroactively and delay in the judicial process we also face risk associated with change in foreign currency exchange rate including those arising from our operation investment and financing transaction related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange rate can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operation and expansion effort our revenue earned from our international operation are primarily denominated in their respective local currency we have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activity relating to our non dollar operation and weakening of these foreign currency the dollar would negatively impact our reported revenue operating profit and income in our international operation many of our tenant are subsidiary of global telecommunication company these

economic goal that are inconsistent with be in position to take action contrary to our interest policy or objective have competing interest in our or other market that could create conflict of interest issue withhold consent contrary to our request or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitment any of which could expose to additional liability or cost including requiring to assume and fulfill the obligation of that joint venture substantial portion of our revenue is derived from small number of tenant and we are sensitive to change in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenant substantial portion of our total operating revenue is derived from small number of tenant if any of these tenant is unwilling or unable to perform it obligation under our agreement with it our revenue result of operation financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected in the ordinary course of our business we do occasionally experience dispute with our tenant generally regarding the interpretation of term in our lease historically we have resolved these dispute in manner that not have material adverse effect on or our tenant relationship however it is possible that such dispute could lead to termination of our lease with tenant or material modification of the term of those lease either of which could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation or financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these dispute through litigation our relationship with the applicable tenant could be terminated or damaged which could lead to decreased revenue or increased cost resulting in corresponding adverse effect on our business result of operation or financial condition due to the long term nature of our tenant lease we depend on the continued financial strength of our tenant many wireless service provider operate with substantial leverage sometimes our tenant or their parent company face financial

expensive in the event of downturn in the economy or disruption in the financial and credit market if our tenant or potential tenant are unable to raise table of content adequate capital to fund their business plan they may reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communication site and our network development service business if result of prolonged economic

deferred rent asset tower asset network location intangible asset or customer related intangible asset the loss of significant tenant or the loss of all or portion of our anticipated lease revenue from certain tenant could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation or financial condition new technology or change in tenant business model could make our tower leasing business le desirable and result in decreasing revenue the development and implementation of new technology designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless network or change in tenant business model could reduce the need for tower based wireless service decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rate in addition tenant may have le of their budget allocated to lease space on our tower the industry is trending towards deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technology example of these technology include spectrally efficient technology which could relieve portion of our tenant network capacity need and result could reduce the demand for tower based antenna space additionally certain small cell complementary network technology could shift portion of our tenant network investment away from the traditional tower based network which may reduce the need for carrier to add more equipment at certain communication site moreover the emergence of alternative technology could reduce the need for tower based broadcast service transmission and reception further tenant may decide to no longer outsource tower infrastructure or otherwise change it business model which would result in decrease in our revenue the development and implementation of any of these and similar technology to any significant degree or change in tenant business model could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation or financial condition if we fail to remain qualified reit we will be subject to tax at

method investment and income tax benefit provision executive overview we are global independent owner operator and developer of communication real estate our primary business is the leasing of space on multi tenant communication site to wireless service provider radio and television broadcast company wireless data and data provider government agency and municipality and tenant in number of other industry in addition to the communication site in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower site for property owner under various contractual arrangement we also hold property interest that we lease to communication service provider and third party tower operator we refer to this business our rental and management operation which accounted for approximately of our total revenue for the year ended december and includes our domestic rental and management segment and our international rental and management segment through our network development service we offer tower related service domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting service and structural analysis service which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenant and equipment on our site including in connection with provider network upgrade we operate reit for federal income tax purpose table of content the following table detail the number of communication site excluding managed site we owned or operated of december country number ofowned site number ofoperated site united state international brazil chile colombia costa rica germany ghana india mexico peru south africa uganda all of the communication site we operate are held pursuant to long term capital lease including those subject to purchase option in september we completed the sale of the operation in panama on february we signed definitive agreement for the proposed verizon transaction pursuant to which we expect to acquire the exclusive right to lease acquire or otherwise operate and manage up to wireless communication site in the united state for billion in cash at closing subject to certain condition and limited adjustment the majority of our tenant lease with wireless carrier have an initial non cancellable term of ten year with multiple renewal term accordingly nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management operation during the year ended december wa recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future period based upon foreign currency exchange rate and the tenant lease in place of december we expect to generate approximately billion of non cancellable tenant lease revenue over future period absent the impact of straight line lease accounting most of our tenant lease have provision that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically annually based on fixed escalation approximately in the united state or an inflationary index in our international market or combination of both in addition certain of our tenant lease provide for additional revenue to cover cost such ground rent or power and fuel cost the revenue generated by our rental and management operation may also be affected by cancellation of existing tenant lease discussed above most of our tenant lease with wireless carrier and broadcaster are multi year contract which typically are non cancellable however in some instance lease may be canceled upon the payment of termination fee revenue lost from either cancellation of lease at the end of their term or rent negotiation historically ha not had material adverse effect on the revenue generated by our rental and management operation during the year ended december loss of revenue from tenant lease cancellation or renegotiations represented approximately of our rental and management operation revenue rental and management operation revenue growth due to our diversified communication site portfolio our tenant lease rate vary considerably depending upon numerous factor including but not limited to amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower ground space required by the tenant remaining tower capacity and table of content tower location we measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factor including tower height tower type environmental condition existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulation in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located in many instance tower capacity can be increased through tower augmentation the primary factor affecting the revenue growth in our domestic and international rental and management segment are recurring organic revenue which is revenue from tenant lease attributable to site that existed in our portfolio of the beginning of the prior year period legacy site contractual rent escalation on existing tenant lease net of cancellation new revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our legacy site and new revenue attributable to site acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period new site we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communication service and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our wireless real estate by adding new tenant and new equipment for existing tenant on our site we are able to increase these site utilization and profitability we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service provider our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide with new business opportunity which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth wireless carrier seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing network while also deploying next generation wireless technology in addition consistent with our signing of definitive agreement for the proposed verizon transaction we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy site by selectively developing or acquiring new site in our existing and in new market where we can achieve our risk adjusted return on investment objective in majority of our international market revenue also includes the reimbursement of direct cost such ground rent or power and fuel cost rental and management operation organic revenue growth consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy site our objective is to add new tenant and new equipment for existing tenant through collocation and lease amendment our ability to lease additional space on our site is primarily function of the rate at which wireless carrier deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless network this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless communication service the penetration of advanced wireless device the financial performance of our tenant and their access to capital and general economic condition the following key trend within each market that we serve provide opportunity for organic revenue growth domestic result of the rapid subscriber adoption of bandwidth intensive wireless data application and advanced wireless device wireless service provider in the united state continue to invest in their wireless network by adding new cell site well additional equipment to their existing cell site growth in wireless data demand ha driven wireless provider in the united state to deploy increasing level of annual wireless capital investment and result we have experienced strong demand for our communication site based on industry research and projection we expect the following key industry trend will result in incremental revenue opportunity for the deployment of advanced wireless technology across existing wireless network will provide higher speed data service and enable fixed broadband substitution result we expect our tenant to continue deploying additional equipment across their existing network wireless service provider compete based on the quality of their existing wireless network which is driven by capacity and coverage to maintain or improve their network performance overall network usage increase our tenant continue deploying additional equipment across their table of content existing site while also adding new cell site we anticipate increasing network densification over the next several year existing network infrastructure is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing level of wireless data usage wireless service provider are also investing in reinforcing their network through incremental backhaul and the utilization of on site generator which typically result in additional equipment or space leased at the tower site and incremental revenue wireless service provider continue to acquire additional spectrum and result are expected to add additional site and equipment to their network they seek to optimize their network configuration we have entered into holistic master lease agreement with three of our four largest tenant in the united state which provide for consistent long term revenue and reduction in the likelihood of churn typically these agreement include built in annual escalator fixed annual charge which permit our tenant to place pre determined amount of equipment on certain of our site and provision for incremental lease payment if the equipment level are exceeded our holistic master lease agreement build and augment strong strategic partnership with our tenant and have significantly reduced collocation cycle time thereby providing our tenant with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our site international part of our international expansion initiative we have targeted market in various stage of network development in order to diversify our international exposure and position to benefit from number of different wireless technology deployment over the long term in addition we have focused on building relationship with large multinational carrier such mtn group limited telefónica vodafone group plc and bharti airtel limited we believe that consistent carrier investment in their network across our international market position to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward in emerging market such ghana india and uganda wireless network tend to be significantly le advanced than those in the united state and initial voice network continue to be deployed in underdeveloped area in more developed urban location within these market early stage data network deployment are underway carrier are focused on completing voice network build out while also investing in initial data network wireless data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer base begin to accelerate in market with rapidly evolving network technology such south africa and most of the country in latin america where we do business initial voice network for the most part have already been built out and carrier are focused on third generation network build out and augmentation with select initial investment in fourth generation technology recent spectrum auction in these rapidly evolving market have allowed incumbent carrier to accelerate their data network deployment and have also enabled new entrant to begin initial investment in data network smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these market are growing rapidly which mandate that carrier continue to invest in their network in order to maintain and augment their quality of service finally in market with more mature network technology such germany carrier are focused on deploying data network to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage with more mature customer base higher smartphone penetration and significantly higher per caput data usage carrier investment in network is focused on coverage and capacity we believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the united state which ha led to significantly denser network and meaningful new business commencement for over number of year will ultimately be replicated in our le advanced international market result we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately communication site and the relationship we have built with our carrier customer to drive sustainable long term growth table of content rental and management operation new site revenue growth during the year ended december we grew our portfolio of communication real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately site in majority of our international market the acquisition or construction of new site result in increased pas through revenue such ground rent or power and fuel cost and expense we continue to evaluate opportunity to acquire communication real estate portfolio both domestically and internationally to determine whether they meet our risk adjusted hurdle rate and whether we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing portfolio new site acquired or constructed domestic international the majority of site acquired or constructed in were in brazil india and mexico in were in brazil colombia costa rica india mexico and south africa and in were in brazil germany india and uganda rental and management operation expense direct operating expense incurred by our domestic and international rental and management segment include direct site level expense and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel cost some of which may be passed through to our tenant well property tax repair and maintenance these segment direct operating expense exclude all segment and corporate selling general administrative and development expense which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling general administrative and development expense in our consolidated statement of operation in general our domestic and international rental and management segment selling general administrative and development expense do not significantly increase result of adding incremental tenant to our legacy site and typically increase only modestly year over year result leasing additional space to new tenant on our legacy site provides significant incremental cash flow we may however incur additional segment selling general administrative and development expense we increase our presence in geographic area where we have recently launched operation or are focused on expanding our portfolio our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenant to our legacy site and can be temporarily diluted by our development activity network development service segment revenue growth we continue to focus on growing our rental and management

being able to borrow additional fund under these credit facility but would constitute default under these credit facility which could result in among other thing the amount outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fee becoming immediately due and payable if this were to occur we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factor affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenant described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance test defined in the loan agreement for these credit facility and our ability to fund our debt service obligation based upon our current expectation we believe our operating result during the next twelve month will be sufficient to comply with these covenant restriction under agreement relating to the securitization and the gtp note the first amended and restated loan and security agreement related to the securitization the loan agreement and indenture governing the gtp note the gtp indenture include certain financial ratio and operating covenant and other restriction customary for transaction subject to rated securitizations among other thing american tower asset sub llc and american tower asset sub ii llc the borrower and the gtp issuer are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their asset subject to customary carve out for ordinary course trade payable and permitted encumbrance defined in the loan agreement or the applicable gtp indenture under the term of the agreement amount due will be paid from the cash flow generated by the asset securing the nonrecourse loan relating to the securitization the loan or the gtp note applicable which must be deposited and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the term of the applicable agreement on monthly basis after payment of all required amount under the applicable agreement the excess cash flow generated from the operation of the asset securing the loan or the gtp note are released to the borrower or the applicable gtp issuer which can then be distributed to and used by during the year ended december the borrower distributed excess cash to of million and the gtp issuer have distributed excess cash to of million in order to distribute this excess cash flow to the borrower and the gtp issuer must maintain specified debt service coverage ratio dscr calculated the ratio of the net cash flow defined in the loan agreement or the applicable gtp indenture to the amount of interest required to be paid over the succeeding twelve month on the principal amount of the loan or the principal amount of the gtp note that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination plus the amount payable for trustee and servicing fee if the dscr with respect to the secured tower revenue security series and series issued in our securitization the security or any series of gtp note issued by gtp partner is equal to or below the cash trap dscr at the end of any calendar quarter and it continues for two consecutive calendar quarter or if the dscr with respect to any series of gtp note issued by gtp cellular site is equal to or below the cash trap dscr at the end of any calendar month and it continues for two consecutive calendar month then all cash flow in excess of amount required to make debt service payment fund required reserve pay management fee and budgeted operating expense and make other payment required with respect to the particular series of security or gtp note under the loan agreement or gtp indenture applicable will be deposited into reserve account instead of being released to the borrower or the gtp issuer the fund in the reserve account will not be released to the borrower or gtp partner for distribution to unless the dscr with respect to such series of security or gtp note exceeds the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar quarter likewise the fund in the reserve account will not be released to gtp cellular site for distribution to unless the dscr with respect to such series of gtp note exceeds the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar month table of content additionally an amortization period commences of the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the security and the series of gtp note issued by gtp partner and of the end of any calendar month with respect to the series of gtp note issued by gtp cellular site if the dscr of such series equal or fall below the minimum dscr the amortization period will continue to exist until the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the security and the series of gtp note issued by gtp partner for which the dscr exceeds the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar quarter similarly the amortization period will continue to exist until the end of any calendar month with respect to the series of gtp note issued by gtp cellular site for which the dscr exceeds the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar month if on the anticipated repayment date the outstanding principal amount with respect to any series of the gtp note or the component of the loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of the security ha not been paid in full an amortization period will continue until such principal amount of the applicable series of gtp note or the component of the loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of security is repaid in full during an amortization period all excess cash flow and any amount then in the reserve account because the cash trap dscr wa not met would be applied to pay principal of the applicable subclass of security or series of gtp note on each monthly payment date and so would not be available for distribution to further additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any subclass of the security or series of gtp note from and after the anticipated repayment date at per annum rate determined in accordance with the loan agreement or the gtp indenture applicable consequently failure to meet the noted dscr test could prevent the borrower or gtp issuer from distributing excess cash flow to which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditure including tower construction and acquisition meet reit distribution requirement make mandatory convertible preferred stock dividend payment and fund our stock repurchase program if the borrower were to default on the loan the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the wireless and broadcast communication tower that secure the loan the secured tower in which case we could lose the secured tower and the revenue associated with those tower in addition upon occurrence and during an event of default the trustee may in it discretion or at direction of holder of more than of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of gtp note declare such series of gtp note immediately due and payable in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holder of such gtp note furthermore if the gtp issuer were to default on series of the gtp note the trustee may demand collect take possession of receive settle compromise adjust sue for foreclose or realize upon all or any portion of the tower and property interest and other related asset that secure the gtp note the gtp secured site securing such series of the gtp note in which case we could lose the gtp secured site and the revenue associated with those asset of december the borrower dscr wa based on the borrower net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended december and the amount of interest servicing fee and trustee fee payable over the succeeding twelve month on the loan the borrower could endure reduction of approximately million in net cash flow before triggering the cash trap dscr and approximately million in net cash flow before triggering the minimum dscr of december the dscr of gtp partner and gtp cellular site were and respectively based on the net cash flow of gtp partner and gtp cellular site for the calendar quarter ended december and the amount of interest servicing fee and trustee fee payable over the succeeding twelve month on the applicable series of gtp note gtp partner and gtp cellular site could endure reduction of approximately million and million respectively in net cash flow before triggering the cash trap dscr and approximately million and million respectively in net cash flow before triggering the minimum dscr discussed above we use our available liquidity and seek new source of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness in addition in order to fund capital expenditure future growth and expansion initiative and satisfy our reit distribution requirement we may need to raise additional capital table of content through financing activity if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital we may be unable to do so or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the term of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our need arise we may not be able to fund capital expenditure future growth and expansion initiative satisfy our reit distribution requirement pay mandatory convertible preferred stock dividend or refinance our existing indebtedness in addition our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activity set forth under item of this annual report under the caption risk factor we derive substantial portion of our revenue from small number of tenant and consequently failure by significant tenant to perform it contractual obligation to could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity critical accounting policy and estimate management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statement requires to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense well related disclosure of contingent asset and liability we evaluate our policy and estimate on an ongoing basis management base it estimate on historical experience and various other assumption that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying amount of asset and liability that are not readily apparent from other source actual result may differ from these estimate under different assumption or condition we have reviewed our policy and estimate to determine our critical accounting policy for the year ended december we have identified the following policy critical to an understanding of our result of operation and financial condition this is not comprehensive list of our accounting policy see note to our consolidated financial statement included in this annual report for summary of our significant accounting policy in many case the accounting treatment of particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for management judgment in it application there are also area in which management judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce materially different result impairment of asset asset subject to depreciation and amortization we review long lived asset for impairment at least annually or whenever event change in circumstance or other indicator or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our asset may not be recoverable we review our tower portfolio and network location intangible asset for indicator of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flow typically at an individual tower basis possible indicator include tower not having current tenant lease or having expense in excess of revenue cash flow modeling approach is utilized to ass recoverability and incorporates among other item the tower location the tower location demographic the timing of addition of new tenant lease rate and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirement we review our customer related intangible asset on customer by customer basis for indicator of impairment such high level of turnover or attrition non renewal of significant number of contract or the cancellation or termination of relationship we ass recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the customer related intangible asset will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flow if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flow of our long lived asset is le than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss may be recognized an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flow to be provided from the asset we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment impairment of asset goodwill we review goodwill for impairment at least annually of december or whenever event or circumstance indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable table of content goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level we utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment and we employ discounted cash flow analysis the key assumption utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance terminal sale growth rate management expectation of future operating result and cash requirement the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate under the first step of this test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flow to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value we conduct the second step of this test in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds it implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess during the year ended december no potential impairment wa identified under the first step of the test the fair value of each of our reporting unit wa in excess of it carrying amount by substantial margin asset retirement obligation when required we recognize the fair value of obligation to remove our tower asset and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower asset are located generally the associated retirement cost are capitalized part of the carrying amount of the related tower asset and depreciated over their estimated useful life and the liability is accreted through the obligation estimated settlement date we updated our assumption used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in net increase in the estimated obligation of million during the year ended december the change in primarily resulted from change in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumption fair value estimate of liability for asset retirement obligation generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flow periodic accretion of such liability due to the passage of time is included in depreciation amortization and accretion in the consolidated statement of operation the significant assumption used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removal cost of tower removal timing and number of land lease renewal expected inflation rate and credit adjusted risk free interest rate that approximate our incremental borrowing rate while we feel the assumption are appropriate there can be no assurance that actual cost and the probability of incurring obligation will not differ from these estimate we will continue to review these assumption periodically and we may need to adjust them necessary acquisition for those acquisition that meet the definition of business combination we apply the acquisition method of accounting where asset acquired and liability assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition and the result of operation are included with those of the company from the date of the respective acquisition any excess of the purchase price paid over the amount recognized for asset acquired and liability assumed is recorded goodwill we continue to evaluate acquisition for period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustment are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the asset acquired and liability assumed the fair value of the asset acquired and liability assumed is typically determined by using either estimate of replacement cost or discounted cash flow valuation method when determining the fair value of tangible asset acquired we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with new asset taking into consideration such factor age condition and the economic useful life of the asset when determining the fair value of intangible asset acquired we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future customer cash flow including rate and term of renewal and attrition revenue recognition our revenue from leasing arrangement including fixed escalation clause present in non cancellable lease arrangement is reported on straight line basis over the term of the respective lease when collectibility is reasonably assured escalation clause tied to the consumer price index or other inflation based index and other incentive present in lease agreement with our table of content tenant are excluded from the straight line calculation total rental and management straight line revenue for the year ended december and approximated million million and million respectively amount billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreement are initially deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and recognized revenue over the term of the applicable lease amount billed or received for service prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet until the criterion for recognition have been met we derive the largest portion of our revenue corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from small number of tenant in the telecommunication industry and approximately of our revenue are derived from four tenant in the industry in addition we have concentration of credit risk in certain geographic area we mitigate the concentration of credit risk with respect to note and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrower and tenant in recognizing customer revenue we ass the collectibility of both the amount billed and the portion recognized on straight line basis this assessment take tenant credit risk and business and industry condition into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amount billed to the extent the amount based on management estimate may not be collectible recognition is deferred until such point the uncertainty is resolved any amount that were previously recognized revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense account receivable are reported net of allowance for doubtful account related to estimated loss resulting from tenant inability to make required payment and allowance for amount invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured rent expense many of the lease underlying our tower site have fixed rent escalation which provide for periodic increase in the amount of ground rent payable over time in addition certain of our tenant lease require to exercise available renewal option pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercise it renewal option we calculate straight line ground rent expense for these lease based on the fixed non cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all period if any for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured stock based compensation the stock based compensation expense recognized over the service period which is generally the vesting period is required to include an estimate of the award that will not fully vest and be forfeited the fair value of stock option is determined using black scholes option pricing model that take into account number of assumption at the accounting measurement date including the stock price the exercise price the expected life of the option the volatility of the underlying stock the expected distribution and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option these assumption are highly subjective and could significantly impact the value of the option and the compensation expense the fair value of restricted stock unit is based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date we recognize stock based compensation in either selling general administrative and development expense cost of operation or part of the cost associated with the construction of our tower asset income tax accounting for income tax requires to estimate the timing and impact of amount recorded in our financial statement that may be recognized differently for tax purpose to the extent that the timing of amount recognized for financial reporting purpose differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purpose deferred tax asset or liability are required to be recorded deferred tax asset and liability are measured based on the rate at which we expect these item to be reflected in our tax return which may differ from the current rate we do not expect to pay federal tax on our reit taxable income we periodically review our deferred tax asset and we record valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be table of content realized management ass the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be reversed reduction to the provision for income tax if related deferred tax asset are deemed realizable based on change in fact and circumstance relevant to the asset recoverability we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax position when in management judgment it is more likely than not that position we have taken in our tax return will be sustained upon examination which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement we adjust our tax liability when our judgment change result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainty the ultimate resolution may result in payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liability these difference will be reflected increase or decrease to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit we consider the earnings of certain non subsidiary to be indefinitely invested outside the united state on the basis of estimate that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash need should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings we may have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside of the united state accounting standard update for discussion of recent accounting standard update see note to our consolidated financial statement included in
