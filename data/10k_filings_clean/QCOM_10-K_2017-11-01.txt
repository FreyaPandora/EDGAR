automotive and iot and or more established presence in certain region we derive significant portion of our consolidated revenue from small number of customer and licensee if revenue derived from these customer or licensee decrease or the timing of such revenue fluctuates our business and result of operation could be negatively affected our qct segment derives significant portion of it revenue from small number of customer and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future our industry is experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among few company particularly at the premium tier contributing to this trend in addition certain of our largest integrated circuit customer develop their own integrated circuit product which they have in the past chosen and may in the future choose to utilize in certain of their device rather than our integrated circuit product and or sell their integrated circuit product to third party in competition with also one of our largest integrated circuit customer ha utilized product of one of our competitor in certain of their device rather than our product the loss of any one of our significant customer reduction in the purchase of our product by such customer or the cancelation of significant purchase by any of these customer whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit product our competitor integrated circuit product or otherwise would reduce our revenue and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected result of operation and delay of significant purchase even if only temporary would reduce our revenue in the period of the delay any such reduction in revenue would also impact our cash resource available for other purpose such research and development further the concentration of device share among few company and the corresponding purchasing power of these company may result in lower price for our product which if not accompanied by sufficient increase in the volume of purchase of our product could have an adverse effect on our revenue and margin in addition the timing and size of purchase by our significant customer may be impacted by the timing of such customer new or next generation product introduction over which we have no control and the timing of such introduction may cause our revenue and result of operation to fluctuate accordingly if current industry dynamic and concentration continue our qct segment revenue will continue to depend largely upon and be impacted by future purchase and the timing and size of any such future purchase by these significant customer one of our largest customer purchase our mobile data modem mdm product which do not include our integrated application processor technology and which have lower revenue and margin contribution than our combined modem and application processor product to the extent such customer take device share from our other customer who purchase our integrated modem and application processor product our revenue and margin may be negatively impacted further company that develop hlos for device including leading technology company now sell their own device if we fail to effectively partner or continue partnering with these company or with their partner or customer they may decide not to purchase either directly or through their contract manufacturer or to reduce or discontinue their purchase of our integrated circuit product in addition there ha been and continues to be litigation among certain of our customer and other industry participant and the potential outcome of such litigation including but not limited to injunction against device that incorporate our product and or intellectual property or ruling on certain patent law or patent licensing issue that create new legal precedent could impact our business particularly if such action impact one of our larger customer although we have several hundred licensee our qtl segment derives significant portion of it licensing revenue from limited number of licensee in the event that one or more of our significant licensee fail to meet their reporting and or payment obligation or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of such license agreement under similar term our revenue result of operation and cash flow would be adversely impacted moreover the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensee to develop introduce and deliver high volume product that achieve and sustain customer acceptance we have no control over the product development sale effort or pricing of product by our licensee and our licensee might not be successful reduction in the average selling price of wireless device sold by our significant licensee without sufficient increase in the volume of such device sold would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenue derive significant portion of our consolidated revenue from the premium tier device segment if sale of premium tier device decrease and or sale of our premium tier integrated circuit product decrease our result of operation could be negatively affected we derive significant portion of our revenue from the premium tier device segment and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future we have experienced and expect to continue to experience slowing growth in the premium tier device segment due to among other factor lengthening replacement cycle in developed region where premium tier smartphones are common increasing consumer demand in emerging region particularly china and india where premium tier smartphones are le common and replacement cycle are on average longer than in developed region and or maturing premium tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launch and or innovation cycle in addition discussed in the prior risk factor our industry is experiencing concentration of device share among few company at the premium tier which give them significant supply chain leverage further those company may utilize their own internally developed integrated circuit product or our competitor integrated circuit product rather than our product in portion of their device these dynamic may result in lower price for and or reduced sale of our premium tier integrated circuit product reduction in sale of premium tier device or reduction in sale of our premium tier integrated circuit product which have higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower tier integrated circuit product may reduce our revenue and margin and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial result any such reduction in revenue would also impact our cash resource available for other purpose such research and development effort by some communication equipment manufacturer or their customer to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalty for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resource and may result in legal decision and or action by government court regulator or agency standard development organization sdos or other industry organization that harm our business from time to time company initiate various strategy to attempt to renegotiate mitigate and or eliminate their need to pay royalty to for the use of our intellectual property these strategy have included litigation often alleging infringement of patent held by such company patent misuse patent exhaustion patent invalidity and or unenforceability of our patent and or license that we do not license our patent on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory frand term or some form of unfair competition or competition law violation ii taking position contrary to our understanding of their contract with iii appeal to governmental authority iv collective action including working with wireless operator standard body other like minded company and other organization on both formal and informal base to adopt intellectual property policy and practice that could have the effect of limiting return on intellectual property innovation lobbying governmental regulator and elected official for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rate or the base on which royalty are calculated the imposition of some form of compulsory licensing and or to weaken patent holder ability to enforce it right or obtain fair return for such right and vi licensee using various strategy to attempt to shift their royalty obligation to their supplier that result in lowering the wholesale licensee selling price on which the royalty is calculated in addition certain licensee have disputed underreported underpaid not reported and or not paid royalty owed to under their license agreement or reported to in manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligation and certain company have yet to enter into or delayed entering into or renewing license agreement with for their use of our intellectual property and licensee and or company may continue to do in the future the fact that one or more licensee dispute underreport underpay do not report and or do not pay royalty owed to may encourage other licensee to take similar action and may encourage other licensee or unlicensed company to delay entering into or not enter into new license agreement further to the extent such licensee and or company increase their device share the negative impact of their underreporting underpayment non payment and or non reporting on our business revenue result of operation financial condition and or cash flow will be exacerbated we are currently subject to various litigation and governmental investigation and or proceeding some of which have arisen and may continue to arise out of the strategy described above certain legal matter are described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matter could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and or cash flow depending on the type of matter various remedy that could result from an unfavorable resolution include among others injunction monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money and the issuance of order to cease certain conduct and or modify our business practice further governmental body in particular country or region may assert and may be successful in imposing remedy with effect that extend beyond the border of that or region see also the risk factor entitled if we are required to change our patent licensing practice due to governmental investigation and or private legal proceeding challenging those practice our business and result of operation could be adversely impacted in addition in connection with our participation in sdos we like other patent owner generally have made contractual commitment to such organization to license those of our patent that would necessarily be infringed by standard compliant product set forth in those commitment some manufacturer and user of standard compliant product advance interpretation of these commitment that are adverse to our licensing business including interpretation that would limit the amount of royalty that we could collect on the licensing of our patent portfolio further some company or entity have proposed significant change to existing intellectual property policy for implementation by sdos and other industry organization with the goal of significantly devaluing standard essential patent for example some have put forth proposal which would require maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard essential patent owned by all of the member company to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard they have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard essential patent based upon the number of standard essential patent held by such company others have proposed that injunction not be an available remedy for infringement of standard essential patent and or have made proposal that could severely limit damage award and other remedy by court for patent infringement by severely limiting the base upon which the royalty percentage may be applied number of these strategy are purportedly based on interpretation of the policy of certain sdos concerning the licensing of patent that are or may be essential to industry standard and on our and or other company alleged failure to abide by these policy some sdos court and governmental agency have adopted and may in the future adopt some or all of these interpretation or proposal in manner adverse to our interest including in litigation to which we may not be party we expect that such proposal interpretation and strategy will continue in the future and if successful our business model would be harmed either by limiting or eliminating our ability to collect royalty or by reducing the royalty we can collect on all or portion of our patent portfolio limiting our return on investment with respect to new technology limiting our ability to seek injunction against infringers of our standard essential patent constraining our ability to make licensing commitment when submitting our technology for inclusion in future standard which could make our technology le likely to be included in such standard or forcing to work outside of sdos or other industry group to promote our new technology and our revenue result of operation and or cash flow could be negatively impacted in addition the legal and other cost associated with asserting or defending our position have been and continue to be significant we assume that such challenge regardless of their merit will continue into the foreseeable future and may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resource our business particularly our licensing business may suffer result of adverse ruling in government investigation or proceeding we are currently subject to various governmental investigation and or proceeding particularly with respect to our licensing business and certain such matter are described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency key allegation in those matter include among others that we do not license our cellular standard essential patent separately from our other patent that we violate frand licensing commitment by refusing to grant license to chipset maker that our royalty rate are high and or that the base on which our royalty are calculated should be something le than the wholesale licensee selling price of the applicable device minus certain permitted deduction the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matter could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and or cash flow depending on the type of matter various remedy that could result from an unfavorable resolution include among others injunction monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money and the issuance of order to cease certain conduct and or modify our business practice further governmental body in particular country or region may assert and may be successful in imposing remedy with effect that extend beyond the border of that country or region see also the risk factor entitled if we are required to change our patent licensing practice due to governmental investigation and or private legal proceeding challenging those practice our business and result of operation could be adversely impacted if we are required to change our patent licensing practice due to governmental investigation and or private legal proceeding challenging those practice our business and result of operation could be adversely impacted we are currently subject to various governmental investigation and private legal proceeding challenging our patent licensing practice described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency key allegation in those matter include among others that we do not license our cellular standard essential patent separately from our other patent that we violate frand licensing commitment by refusing to license to chipset maker that our royalty rate are too high and or that the base on which our royalty are calculated should be something le than the wholesale licensee selling price of the applicable device minus certain permitted deduction we believe that the ultimate intent of these investigation and legal proceeding is to reduce the amount of royalty that licensee are required to pay to for their use of our intellectual property we have historically licensed our cellular standard essential patent together with our other patent that may be useful to licensed product because licensee typically have desired to obtain the commercial benefit of receiving such broad patent right from however we also have licensed only our cellular standard essential patent to certain licensee who have requested such license in addition in connection with our resolution with the china national development and reform commission ndrc in china our standard practice in china since is to offer license for our and standard essential chinese patent for branded device sold for use in china separately from license to our other patent if we were required to separately license our cellular standard essential patent to all of our licensee worldwide and more licensee chose such license instead of portfolio license than ha historically been the case our licensing revenue and earnings would be negatively impacted unless we were able to license our other patent at rate that offset all or portion of any difference between the royalty previously received for license of substantially all of our patent portfolio compared to license of only our cellular standard essential patent and or there wa sufficient increase in the overall volume of sale of device upon which royalty are paid if we were required to grant patent license to chipset manufacturer to implement more complex tiered licensing structure in which we license certain portion of our patent portfolio to chipset manufacturer and other portion to device manufacturer we would incur additional transaction cost which may be significant and we may incur delay in recognizing revenue until license negotiation were completed in addition our licensing revenue and earnings would be negatively impacted if we were not able to obtain in the aggregate equivalent revenue under such multi level licensing structure if we were required to reduce the royalty rate we charge under our patent license agreement our revenue and earnings would be negatively impacted absent sufficient increase in the volume of sale of device upon which royalty are paid similarly if we were required to reduce the base on which our royalty are calculated our revenue result of operation and or cash flow would be negatively impacted unless there wa sufficient increase in the volume of sale of device upon which royalty are paid and or we were able to increase our royalty rate to offset the decrease in revenue resulting from such lower royalty base assuming the absolute royalty dollar were below any relevant royalty cap to the extent that we were required to implement any of these new licensing practice by modifying or renegotiating our existing license agreement we would incur additional transaction cost which may be significant and we may incur delay in recognizing revenue until license negotiation were completed the impact of any such change to our licensing practice could vary widely and by jurisdiction depending on the specific outcome and the geographic scope of such outcome in addition if we were required to make modification to our licensing practice in one jurisdiction licensee and or governmental agency in other jurisdiction may attempt to obtain similar outcome for and or for such other jurisdiction applicable the enforcement and protection of our intellectual property right may be expensive could fail to prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property right could result in the loss of our ability to enforce one or more patent and or could be adversely affected by change in patent law by law in certain foreign jurisdiction that may not effectively protect our intellectual property right and or by ineffective enforcement of law in such jurisdiction we rely primarily on patent copyright trademark and trade secret law well nondisclosure and confidentiality agreement international treaty and other method to protect our proprietary information technology and process including our patent portfolio policing unauthorized use of our product technology and proprietary information is difficult and time consuming the step we have taken have not always prevented and we can not be certain the step we will take in the future will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary information and technology particularly in foreign country where the law may not protect our proprietary intellectual property right fully or readily united state law or where the enforcement of such law may be lacking or ineffective some industry participant who have vested interest in devaluing patent in general or standard essential patent in particular have mounted attack on certain patent system increasing the likelihood of change to established patent law in the united state there is continued discussion regarding potential patent law change and current and potential future litigation regarding patent the outcome of which could be detrimental to our licensing business the law in certain foreign country in which our product are or may be manufactured or sold including certain country in asia may not protect our intellectual property right to the same extent the law in the united state we expect that the european union will adopt unitary patent system in the next few year that may broadly impact that region patent regime we can not predict with certainty the long term effect of any change in addition we can not be certain that the law and policy of any country or the practice of any standard body foreign or domestic with respect to intellectual property enforcement or licensing or the adoption of standard will not be changed in the future in way detrimental to our licensing program or to the sale or use of our product or technology we have and may in the future have difficulty in certain circumstance in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property right and or contract including collecting royalty for use of our patent portfolio due to among others refusal by certain licensee to report and or pay all or portion of the royalty they owe to policy of foreign government challenge to our licensing practice under competition law adoption of mandatory licensing provision by foreign jurisdiction either with controlled regulated royalty or royalty free failure of foreign court to recognize and enforce judgment of contract breach and damage issued by court in the united state and or challenge competition agency to our licensing business and or the pricing and integration of additional feature and functionality into our chipset product certain licensee have disputed underreported underpaid not reported and or not paid royalty owed to under their license agreement with or reported to in manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligation and certain company have yet to enter into or delayed entering into or renewing license agreement for their use of our intellectual property and such licensee and or company may continue to do so in the future the fact that one or more licensee dispute underreport underpay do not report and or do not pay royalty owed to may encourage other licensee to take similar action and may encourage other licensee or unlicensed company to delay entering into or not enter into new license agreement additionally although our license agreement provide with the right to audit the book and record of licensee audit can be expensive time consuming incomplete and subject to dispute further certain licensee may not comply with the obligation to provide full access to their book and record to the extent we do not aggressively enforce our right under our license agreement licensee may not comply with their existing license agreement and to the extent we do not aggressively pursue unlicensed company to enter into license agreement with for their use of our intellectual property other unlicensed company may not enter into license agreement we have entered into litigation in the past and may need to further litigate in the future to enforce our contract and or intellectual property right protect our trade secret or determine the validity and scope of proprietary right of others we are currently engaged in litigation matter related to protecting or enforcing our contract and or intellectual property right and certain such matter are described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency result of any such litigation we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patent portion of our license agreement could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable which may in turn result in other licensee either not complying with their existing license agreement and or initiating litigation and or we could incur substantial cost any action we take to enforce our contract or intellectual property right could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention which in turn could negatively impact our result of operation and or cash flow further even positive resolution to our enforcement effort may take time to conclude which may reduce our revenue and cash resource available for other purpose such research and development in the period prior to conclusion see also the risk factor entitled if we are required to change our patent licensing practice due to governmental investigation and or private legal proceeding challenging those practice our business and result of operation could be adversely impacted our growth increasingly depends on our ability to extend our technology product and service into new and expanded product area such rffe and adjacent industry segment outside of traditional cellular industry such automotive iot and networking among others our research development and other investment in these new and expanded product area and industry segment and related technology product and service well in our existing technology product and service and new technology such may not generate operating income or contribute to future result of operation that meet our expectation our industry is subject to rapid technological change evolving industry standard and frequent new product introduction and we must make substantial research development and other investment such acquisition in new product service and technology to compete successfully technological innovation generally require significant research and development effort before they are commercially viable while we continue to invest significant resource toward advancement primarily in support of ofdma and based technology we also innovate across broad spectrum of opportunity to deploy new and expanded product and enter into adjacent industry segment by leveraging our existing technical and business expertise and or through acquisition in particular our future growth significantly depends on new and expanded product area such rffe and adjacent industry segment such automotive iot including the connected home smart city wearable voice and music and robotics data center networking computing and machine learning among others our ability to develop leading and cost effective technology product and service for new and expanded product area and adjacent industry segment and third incorporating our technology product and service into device used in these product area and industry segment accordingly we intend to continue to make substantial investment in these new and expanded product area and adjacent industry segment and in developing new product service and technology for these product area and industry segment however our research development and other investment in these new and expanded product area and adjacent industry segment and corresponding technology product and service well in our existing technology product and service and new technology such use of both licensed and unlicensed spectrum and convergence of cellular and wi fi may not succeed due to among others new industry segment and or consumer demand may not grow anticipated our strategy and or the strategy of our customer licensee or partner may not be successful improvement in alternate technology in way that reduce the advantage we anticipate from our investment competitor product or service being more cost effective having more capability or fewer limitation or being brought to market faster than our new product and service and competitor having longer operating history in industry segment that are new to we may also underestimate the cost of or overestimate the future revenue and or margin that could result from these investment and these investment may not or may take many year to generate material return further the automotive industry is subject to long design in time frame long product life cycle and high degree of regulatory and safety requirement necessitating supplier to the industry to comply with stringent qualification process very low defect rate and high reliability standard all of which result in significant barrier to entry and increased cost if our new technology product and or service are not successful or are not successful in the time frame we anticipate we may incur significant cost and or asset impairment our business may not grow anticipated our revenue and or margin may be negatively impacted and or our reputation may be harmed there are numerous risk associated with our operation and control of manufacturing facility we acquired through the formation of our joint venture with tdk holding including higher portion of fixed cost relative to fable model environmental compliance and liability exposure to natural disaster timely supply of equipment and material and manufacturing difficulty manufacturing facility are characterized by higher portion of fixed cost relative to fable model in le favorable industry environment in particular we may be faced with decline in the utilization rate of our manufacturing facility due to decrease in demand for our product during such period our manufacturing facility could operate at lower capacity level while the fixed cost associated with full capacity continue to be incurred resulting in lower gross profit we are subject to many environmental health and safety law and regulation in each jurisdiction in which we operate our manufacturing facility which govern among other thing emission of pollutant into the air wastewater discharge the use and handling of hazardous substance waste disposal the investigation and remediation of soil and ground water contamination and the health and safety of our employee we are also required to obtain and maintain environmental permit from governmental authority for certain of our operation we can not make assurance that we will be at all time in compliance with such law regulation and permit certain environmental law impose strict and in certain circumstance joint and several liability on current or previous owner or operator of real property for the cost of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substance certain of these law also ass liability on person who arrange for hazardous substance to be sent to disposal or treatment facility when such facility are found to be contaminated in addition we could also be held liable for consequence arising out of human exposure to hazardous substance or other environmental damage we have manufacturing facility in asia and europe if tsunami flooding earthquake volcanic eruption or other natural disaster or geopolitical conflict were to damage destroy or disrupt our manufacturing facility it could disrupt our operation delay new production and shipment of inventory or result in costly repair replacement or other cost in addition natural disaster or geopolitical conflict may result in disruption in transportation distribution channel or supply chain or significant increase in the price of raw material our manufacturing operation depend on securing raw material and other supply in adequate quality and quantity in timely manner from multiple supplier and in some case we rely on limited number of supplier particularly in asia accordingly there may be case where supply of raw material and other product are interrupted by disaster accident or some other event at supplier supply is suspended due to quality or other issue or there is shortage of supply due to rapid increase in demand which could impact production and prevent from supplying product to our customer if the supply demand balance is disrupted it may considerably increase cost of manufacturing due to increased price we pay for raw material or fuel from time to time supplier may extend lead time limit the amount supplied to or increase price due to capacity constraint or other factor further it may be difficult or impossible to substitute one piece of equipment for another or replace one type of material with another failure by our supplier to deliver our requirement could result in disruption to our manufacturing operation manufacturing process are highly complex require advanced and costly equipment and must be continuously modified to improve yield and performance difficulty in the production process can reduce yield or interrupt production and result we may not be able to deliver product or do so in timely cost effective or competitive manner further to remain competitive and or meet customer demand we may be required to improve our facility and process technology and carry out extensive research and development each of which may require investment of significant amount of capital and may have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and or cash flow the continued and future success of our licensing program can be impacted by the deployment of other technology in place of technology based on cdma ofdma and their derivative the success of our licensing program for single mode product and emerging industry segment and the need to extend license agreement that are expiring and or to cover additional future patent although we own very strong portfolio of issued and pending patent related to ofdm ofdma wlan and other technology our patent portfolio licensing program in some of these area may be le established and might not be successful in generating licensing revenue our cdma licensing program ha been many wireless operator have selected or have deployed ofdma based lte their next generation technology in existing or future if not yet deployed wireless spectrum band complementary to their existing cdma based network while multimode product are generally covered by our existing licensing agreement product that implement but do not also implement are generally not covered by these agreement we believe that our patented technology are essential and useful to implementation of the lte industry standard and have granted royalty bearing single mode license to the majority of the leading handset and other wireless device company including huawei lg microsoft oppo samsung sony mobile vivo xiaomi and zte they recognize that they need license to our patent to make and sell product implementing standard but not implementing standard the royalty rate for single mode product are lower than our royalty rate for and multimode product accordingly without corresponding increase in volume and or device asp we will not achieve the same licensing revenue on such lte product on and multimode product in addition new connectivity and other service are emerging that rely on device that may or may not be used on traditional cellular network such device used in the iot and automotive industry segment we also seek to diversify and broaden our technology licensing program to new industry segment in which we can utilize our technology leadership such wireless charging and other technology standard even de facto standard that develop these technology mature in particular those that do not include base level of interoperability may impact our ability to obtain royalty at all or that are equivalent to those that we receive for and multimode product used in cellular communication although we believe that our patented technology are essential and useful to the commercialization of such service any royalty we receive may be lower than those we receive from our current licensing program over the long term we need to continue to evolve our patent portfolio particularly in if we do not maintain strong portfolio that is applicable to current and or future standard such product and or service our future licensing revenue could be negatively impacted the license granted to and from under number of our license agreement include only patent that are either filed or issued prior to certain date result there are agreement with some licensee where later patent are not licensed by or to additionally certain of our license agreement including essentially all of our recent agreement in china are effective for specified term in order to license or to obtain license to such later patent or after the expiration of specified term or to receive royalty after the specified time period we will need to extend or modify such license agreement or enter into new license agreement with such licensee accordingly to the extent not renewed on their term or by election for an additional generally multi year period if applicable we will need to extend or modify such license agreement or enter into new license agreement with such licensee more frequently than we have done historically we might not be able to renew those license agreement or enter into new license agreement in the future without affecting the material term and condition of our license agreement with such licensee and such modification or new agreement may negatively impact our revenue if there is delay in renewing license agreement prior to it expiration there would be delay in our ability to recognize revenue related to that licensee product sale further if we are unable to reach agreement on such modification or new agreement it could result in patent infringement litigation with such company we depend on limited number of third party supplier for the procurement manufacture and testing of our product manufactured in fable production model if we fail to execute supply strategy that provide technology leadership supply assurance and low cost our business and result of operation may be harmed we are also subject to order and shipment uncertainty that could negatively impact our result of operation our qct segment primarily utilizes fable production model which mean that we do not own or operate foundry for the production of silicon wafer from which our integrated circuit are made other than the manufacturing facility we now operate through our recently formed holding joint venture we rely on independent third party supplier to the manufacturing and assembly and most of the testing of our integrated circuit our supplier are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw material used in the production of our integrated circuit we employ both turnkey and two stage manufacturing model to purchase our integrated circuit under the turnkey model our foundry supplier are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuit under the two stage manufacturing model we purchase die in singular or wafer form from semiconductor manufacturing foundry and contract with separate third party supplier for manufacturing service such wafer bump probe assembly and the majority of our final test requirement the semiconductor manufacturing foundry that supply product to our qct segment are primarily located in asia are our primary warehouse where we store finished good for fulfillment of customer order the following could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and or negatively impact our revenue business operation profitability and or cash flow reduction interruption delay or limitation in our product supply source failure by our supplier to procure raw material or to provide or allocate adequate manufacturing or test capacity for our product our supplier inability to react to shift in product demand or an increase in raw material or component price our supplier delay in developing leading process technology or inability to develop or maintain leading process technology including transition to smaller geometry process technology the loss of supplier or the inability of supplier to meet performance quality or yield specification or delivery schedule additional expense and or production delay result of qualifying new supplier and commencing volume production or testing in the event of loss of or decision to add or change supplier and or natural disaster or geopolitical conflict particularly in asia impacting our supplier while we have established alternate supplier for certain technology we rely on sole or limited source supplier for certain product subjecting to significant risk including possible shortage of raw material or manufacturing capacity poor product performance and reduced control over delivery schedule manufacturing capability and yield quality assurance quantity and cost to the extent we have established alternate supplier these supplier may require significant level of support to bring complex technology to production result we may invest significant amount of effort and resource and incur higher cost to support and maintain such alternate supplier further any future consolidation of foundry supplier could increase our vulnerability to sole or limited source arrangement and reduce our supplier willingness to negotiate pricing which could negatively impact our ability to achieve cost reduction and or increase our manufacturing cost our arrangement with our supplier may obligate to incur cost to manufacture and test our product that do not decrease at the same rate decrease in pricing to our customer our ability and that of our supplier to develop or maintain leading process technology including transition to smaller geometry process technology and to effectively compete with the manufacturing process and performance of our competitor could impact our ability to introduce new product and meet customer demand could increase our cost possibly decreasing our margin and could subject to the risk of excess inventory our inability to meet customer demand due to sole or limited sourcing and or the additional cost that we incur because of these or other supply constraint or because of the need to support alternate supplier could negatively impact our business our result of operation and or cash flow although we have long term contract with our supplier many of these contract do not provide for long term capacity commitment to the extent we do not have firm commitment from our supplier over specific time period or for any specific quantity our supplier may allocate and in the past have allocated capacity to the production and testing of product for their other customer while reducing or limiting capacity to manufacture or test our product accordingly capacity for our product may not be available when we need it or at reasonable price to the extent we do obtain long term capacity commitment we may incur additional cost related to those commitment and or make non refundable payment for capacity commitment that are not used one or more of our supplier or potential alternate supplier may manufacture cdma or ofdma based integrated circuit that compete with our product such supplier could elect to allocate raw material and manufacturing capacity to their own product and reduce or limit delivery to to our detriment in addition we may not receive reasonable pricing manufacturing or delivery term from our supplier we can not guarantee that the action of our supplier will not cause disruption in our operation that could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligation to our customer or increase our cost of sale we place order with our supplier using our forecast of customer demand which are based on number of assumption and estimate and are generally only partially covered by commitment from our customer if we overestimate customer demand we may experience increased excess and or obsolete inventory which would negatively impact our result of operation claim by other company that we infringe their intellectual property could adversely affect our business from time to time company have asserted and may assert patent copyright and other intellectual property right against our product or product using our technology or other technology used in our industry these claim have resulted and may again result in our involvement in litigation we may not prevail in such litigation given among other factor the complex technical issue and inherent uncertainty in intellectual property litigation if any of our product or service were found to infringe another company intellectual property right we could be subject to an injunction or be required to redesign our product or service which could be costly or to license such right and or pay damage or other compensation to such other company if we are unable to redesign our product or service license such intellectual property right used in our product or service or otherwise distribute our product through licensed supplier we could be prohibited from making and selling such product or providing such service in any potential dispute involving other company patent or other intellectual property our chipset foundry semiconductor assembly and test provider and customer could also become the target of litigation we are contingently liable under certain product sale service license and other agreement to indemnify certain customer chipset foundry and semiconductor assembly and test service provider against certain type of liability and or damage arising from qualifying claim of patent infringement by product or service sold or provided by or by intellectual property provided by to our chipset foundry and semiconductor assembly and test service provider reimbursement under indemnification arrangement could have an adverse effect on our result of operation and or cash flow furthermore any such litigation could severely disrupt the supply of our product and the business of our chipset customer and their customer which in turn could hurt our relationship with them and could result in decline in our chipset sale and or reduction in our licensee sale causing corresponding decline in our chipset and or licensing revenue any claim regardless of their merit could be time consuming to address result in costly litigation divert the effort of our technical and management personnel or cause product release or shipment delay any of which could have an adverse effect on our result of operation and cash flow we expect that we may continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front of administrative body such the united state international trade commission to defend against patent assertion against our product by company some of are attempting to gain competitive advantage or leverage in licensing negotiation we may not be successful in such proceeding and if we are not the range of possible outcome is very broad and may include for example monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money royalty payment injunction on the sale of certain of our integrated circuit product and or on the sale of our customer device using such product and or the issuance of order to cease certain conduct and or modify our business practice further governmental body in particular country or region may assert and may be successful in imposing remedy with effect that extend beyond the border of that country or region in addition

september respectively the increase in unrecognized tax benefit in fiscal wa primarily due to tax position related to transfer pricing we believe that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefit at september may increase or decrease in the next month we are subject to income tax in the united state and numerous foreign jurisdiction and are currently under examination by various tax authority worldwide most notably in country where we earn routine return and tax authority believe substantial value add activity are performed these examination are at

of tax audit and any related legal proceeding could materially differ from amount reflected in our income tax provision and the related accrual segment resultsthe following should be read in conjunction with the fiscal and result of operation for each reportable segment included in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note segment information in million qct qct ebt of revenue earnings loss before tax qct segment qct revenue increased in fiscal and decreased in fiscal due to corresponding fluctuation in equipment and service revenue equipment and service revenue mostly related to sale of msm and accompanying rf power management pm and wireless connectivity integrated circuit were billion billion and billion in fiscal and respectively approximately million million and million msm integrated circuit were sold during fiscal and respectively equipment and service revenue increased in fiscal primarily due to an increase in revenue related to rffe product including million from the formation of our holding joint venture million increase resulting from higher shipment of connectivity product primarily related to adjacent industry segment outside of traditional cellular industry and million increase resulting from the net impact of higher priced product mix and lower average selling price these increase were partially offset by decrease of million primarily related to lower msm and accompanying rf and pm unit shipment driven primarily by decline in share at apple partially offset by higher demand from oems in china the decrease in equipment and service revenue in fiscal resulted primarily from decrease of billion related to lower msm and accompanying rf and pm unit shipment and billion from lower average selling price and lower priced product mix partially offset by net increase of million in revenue related to other product primarily related to higher connectivity shipment resulting from the acquisition of csr in the fourth

did not report or pay royalty due in the third or fourth quarter of fiscal revenue related to the product of apple contract manufacturer and the other licensee in dispute comprised total of approximately billion in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal additionally qtl revenue were negatively impacted by an estimated amount in excess of million related to the dispute with the other licensee who royalty due in the second quarter of fiscal in addition to the above the decrease in qtl revenue during fiscal wa also attributable to the recognition of revenue in fiscal relating to the termination of an infrastructure license agreement resulting from the merger of two licensee and decreased recognition of unearned license fee partially offset by an increase in revenue per unit and higher royalty revenue recognized related to device sold in prior period qtl ebt percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the decrease in qtl revenue qtl revenue and ebt in fiscal and also continued to be impacted negatively by unit that we believe are not being reported by certain other licensee and sale of certain unlicensed product while we have reached agreement with many licensee negotiation with certain other licensee and unlicensed company are ongoing particularly in emerging region including china and additional litigation may become necessary if negotiation fail to resolve the relevant issue the decrease in qtl revenue in fiscal of million wa primarily attributable to decrease in revenue per reported unit and recognition of unearned

of fiscal due to the termination of an infrastructure license agreement resulting from the merger of two licensee qtl account receivable increased by more than in fiscal from million to billion primarily due to the short payment of royalty reported in the second quarter of fiscal by and deemed collectible from apple contract manufacturer and the timing of the collection of payment from certain of our other licensee qsi segment the decrease in qsi ebt in fiscal of million wa primarily due to the effect of million gain on the sale of wireless spectrum recorded in fiscal partially offset by the net impact of million resulting from higher revenue and cost associated with certain development contract with one of our equity method investees the increase in qsi ebt in fiscal of million wa primarily due to million gain on the sale of wireless spectrum an increase of million in net realized gain on investment and decrease of million in impairment loss on investment looking forwardwe expect continued growth in the coming year in consumer demand for multimode and product and service around the world driven primarily by smartphones we also expect growth in new device category and industry driven by the expanding adoption of certain technology that are already commonly used in smartphones by industry segment outside traditional cellular industry such automotive iot and networking we look forward to the next several month and beyond we expect our business to be impacted by the following key item on october we announced definitive agreement under which qualcomm river holding an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of qualcomm incorporated will acquire nxp pursuant to the definitive agreement qualcomm river holding ha commenced tender offer to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common share of nxp for per share in cash for estimated total cash consideration to be paid to nxp shareholder of billion nxp is leader in high performance mixed signal semiconductor electronics in automotive broad based microcontrollers secure identification network processing and rf power product the transaction is subject to receipt of regulatory approval in various jurisdiction and other closing condition including the tender of at least of the issued and outstanding common share of nxp in the offer provided that the minimum tender threshold may be reduced to percentage not le than with the prior written consent of nxp while we continue to work to close by the end of calendar the transaction may close in early we intend to fund the transaction with cash generated from our recent debt offering well cash held by our foreign entity and use of term loan which we expect to draw on at close we expect that this acquisition will continue to require to devote significant resource and management time and attention and utilize substantial portion of our cash cash equivalent and marketable security regulatory authority in certain jurisdiction continue to investigate our business practice and other regulatory authority may do so in the future unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matter have had and could in the future have material adverse effect on our business with remedy that include among others injunction monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money and the issuance of order to cease certain conduct and or modify our business practice additionally certain of our direct and indirect customer and licensee including blackberry limited and apple inc have pursued and others may in the future pursue litigation or arbitration against related to our business unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matter have had and could in the future have material adverse effect on our business including monetary damage these activity have required and we expect that they will continue to require the investment of significant management time and attention and resulted and we expect that they will continue to result in increased legal cost see note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency included in this annual report we are currently in dispute with apple surrounding what we believe is an attempt by apple to reduce the amount of royalty that it contract manufacturer are required to pay to for use of our intellectual property qtl revenue and ebt in fiscal were negatively impacted result of action taken by apple and it contract manufacturer such contract manufacturer did not fully report and did not pay royalty due on sale of apple product for portion of the fiscal year we have taken action against apple contract manufacturer to compel such licensee to pay the required royalty and against apple additionally qtl revenue and ebt in fiscal were negatively impacted by the previously disclosed dispute with another licensee who did not fully report or fully pay royalty due in the last three quarter of fiscal we expect these company will continue to take such action in the future resulting in increased legal cost and negatively impacting our future revenue well our financial condition result of operation and cash flow until the respective dispute are resolved we continue to believe that certain licensee particularly in china are not fully complying with their contractual obligation to report their sale of licensed product to and certain company including unlicensed company particularly in emerging region including china are delaying execution of new license agreement we have made substantial progress in reaching agreement with many company primarily in china however negotiation with certain licensee and unlicensed company are ongoing we believe that the conclusion of new agreement with these company will result in improved reporting by these licensee including with respect to sale of three mode device device that implement gsm td scdma and lte tdd sold in china additionally we believe our increased effort in the area of compliance will improve reporting but will also result in increased cost to the business litigation and or other action such those recently taken against apple and it contract manufacturer may be necessary to compel licensee to report and pay the required royalty for sale they have not previously reported and or to compel unlicensed company to execute license such litigation or other action would result in increased legal cost we expect our business particularly qct to continue to be impacted by industry dynamic including concentration of device share among few company within the premium tier resulting in significant supply chain leverage for those company decision by company to utilize their own internally developed integrated circuit product and or sell such product to others including by bundling with other product increasing competition decision by certain company to utilize our competitor integrated circuit product in all or portion of their device for example commencing with the iphone which wa released in september we are no longer the sole supplier of modem for new iphone product launch apple utilizes modem from one of our competitor in portion of such device we expect that in the future apple will utilize our competitor modem in portion of or potentially all iphones accordingly qct revenue from modem sale for iphones declined in fiscal and may continue to decline in the future in part depending on the extent of apple utilization of competitor modem and the mix of the various version that are sold overall qct revenue well profitability may similarly decline unless offset by sale of integrated circuit product to other customer including those outside of traditional cellular industry such automotive iot and networking apple dual sourcing not impact our licensing revenue since our licensing revenue from apple product are not dependent upon whether such product include our chipsets intense competition particularly in china our competitor expand their product offering and or reduce the price of their product part of strategy to attract new and or retain existing customer and lengthening replacement cycle in developed region where the smartphone industry is mature premium tier smartphones are common and consumer demand is increasingly driven by new product launch and or innovation cycle and from increasing consumer demand in emerging region where premium tier smartphones are le common and replacement cycle are on average longer than in developed region consumer demand for smartphone product is increasing in emerging region driven by availability of lower tier device we expect the ongoing rollout of service in emerging region will encourage competition and growth bringing the benefit of lte multimode to consumer we continue to invest significant resource toward advancement in lte and technology ofdm based wlan technology wireless baseband chip our converged computing communication snapdragon chip radio connectivity power management graphic audio and video codecs multimedia product and software which contribute to the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio we are also investing in targeted opportunity that leverage our existing technical and business expertise to deploy new business model and enter and or expand into new industry segment such product for automotive iot including the connected home smart city wearable voice and music and robotics data center networking computing and machine learning among others in addition to the foregoing business and market based matter we continue to devote resource to working with and educating participant in the wireless value chain and government to the benefit of our business model and our extensive technology investment in promoting highly competitive and innovative wireless industry however we expect that certain company may continue to be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalty for the use of our technology and not welcome the success of our business model in enabling new highly cost effective competitor to their product we expect that such company and or government or regulator will continue to challenge our business model in various forum throughout the world further discussion of risk related to our business is presented in part item risk factor included in this annual report liquidity and capital resourceson october we announced definitive agreement under which qualcomm river holding will acquire nxp pursuant to the definitive agreement qualcomm river holding ha commenced tender

due in the third or fourth quarter of fiscal our day sale outstanding on consolidated basis increased to day at september compared to day at september the increase in account receivable and the related day sale outstanding were primarily due to the short payment in the second quarter of fiscal of royalty reported by and deemed collectible from apple contract manufacturer we expect these

revenue related to integrated circuit and the timing of the collection of payment from certain of our other licensee the increase in inventory wa primarily due to inventory relating to our holding joint venture and an increase in the overall quantity of unit on hand partially offset by lower average unit cost our cash cash equivalent and marketable security at september consisted of billion held by our united state based entity and billion held by our foreign entity most of our cash cash equivalent and marketable security held by our foreign entity are indefinitely reinvested and would be subject to material tax effect if repatriated however we believe that our united state source of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business need in the united state and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the fund we believe our current cash cash equivalent and marketable security our expected cash flow generated from operation and our expected financing activity will satisfy our working and other capital requirement for at least the next month based on our current business plan recent and expected working and other capital requirement in addition to our proposed

above due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of cash settlement with the taxing authority additional information regarding our financial commitment at september is provided in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note income tax note debt and note commitment and contingency critical accounting estimatesthe preparation of our consolidated financial statement in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state requires to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and disclosure of contingent asset and liability we base our estimate on historical and anticipated result and trend and on various other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance including assumption to future event by their nature estimate are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty although we believe that our estimate and the assumption supporting our assessment are reasonable actual result that differ from our estimate could be material to our consolidated financial statement summary of our significant accounting policy is included in this report in note to consolidated financial statement note the company and it significant accounting policy we consider the following accounting estimate to be critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement impairment of marketable security and other investment we hold investment in marketable security with increase and decrease in fair value generally recorded through stockholder equity other comprehensive income or loss we record impairment loss in earnings when we believe an investment ha experienced decline that is other than temporary during fiscal and we recorded million million and million respectively in impairment loss on our investment in marketable security in connection with the proposed nxp transaction during fiscal we divested substantial portion of our marketable security portfolio in order to finance in part that transaction given the change in our intention to sell certain marketable security we recognized other than temporary impairment loss in fiscal for such marketable security and may recognize additional loss prior to the sale of such marketable security still held at september for the available for sale security that are not expected to be sold to finance the nxp transaction we concluded that the gross unrealized loss of million were temporary at september we also hold investment in non marketable equity instrument in privately held company that are accounted for using either the cost or the equity method many of these investment are in early stage company which are inherently risky because the market for the technology or product of these company are uncertain and may never develop we monitor our investment for event or circumstance that could indicate the investment are impaired such deterioration in the investee financial condition and business forecast and lower valuation in recently completed or proposed financing and we record impairment loss in earnings when we believe an investment ha experienced decline in value that is other than temporary valuation of inventory inventory are valued at the lower of cost or market replacement cost not to exceed net realizable value using the first in first out method recoverability of inventory is assessed based on review of future customer demand that considers multiple factor including committed purchase order from customer well purchase commitment projection provided by customer among other thing this valuation also requires to make judgment and assumption based on information currently available about market condition including competition product pricing product life cycle and development plan if we overestimate demand for our product the amount of our loss will be impacted by our contractual ability to reduce inventory purchase from our supplier our assumption of future product demand are inherently uncertain and change in our estimate and assumption may cause to realize material write down in the future valuation of goodwill and other indefinite lived and long lived asset our business combination typically result in the recording of goodwill other intangible asset and property plant and equipment and the recorded value of those asset may become impaired in the future we also acquire intangible asset and property plant and equipment in other type of transaction the determination of the recorded value of intangible asset acquired in business combination requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect our consolidated financial statement for intangible asset acquired in non monetary exchange the estimated fair value of the asset transferred or the estimated fair value of the asset received if more clearly evident are used to establish their recorded value unless the value of neither the asset received nor the asset transferred are determinable within reasonable limit in which case the asset received are measured based on the carrying value of the asset transferred valuation technique consistent with the market approach income approach and or cost approach are used to measure fair value an estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumption that require significant judgment for example the income approach generally requires to use assumption to estimate future cash flow including those related to total addressable market pricing and share forecast competition technology obsolescence future tax rate and discount rate our estimate of the fair value of certain asset may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumption or utilize different business model and from the future cash flow actually realized goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset are tested annually for impairment and in interim period if certain event occur indicating that the carrying amount may be impaired long lived asset such property plant and equipment and intangible asset subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicator and future cash flow related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset and long lived asset may be based on operational performance of our business market condition expected selling price and or other factor although there are inherent uncertainty in this assessment process the estimate and assumption we use including estimate of future cash flow and discount rate are consistent with our internal planning when appropriate if these estimate or their related assumption change in the future we may be required to record an impairment charge on or all of our goodwill other indefinite lived intangible asset and or long lived asset furthermore we can not predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering event nor the impact such event might have on our reported asset value future event could cause to conclude that impairment indicator exist and that goodwill or other intangible asset associated with our acquired business are impaired any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and result of operation during fiscal and we recorded million million and million respectively in impairment charge for goodwill other indefinite lived intangible asset and long lived asset the estimated fair value of our qct and qtl reporting unit were substantially in excess of their respective carrying value at september legal and regulatory proceeding we are currently involved in certain legal and regulatory proceeding and we intend to continue to vigorously defend however the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceeding could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and or cash flow broad range of remedy with respect to our business practice that are deemed to violate applicable law are potentially available these remedy may include among others injunction monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money and the issuance of order to cease certain conduct and or to modify our business practice we disclose loss contingency if there is at least reasonable possibility that material loss ha been incurred we record our best estimate of loss related to pending legal or regulatory proceeding when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated where range of loss can be reasonably estimated with no best estimate in the range we record the minimum estimated liability additional information becomes available we ass the potential liability including the probability of loss related to pending legal or regulatory proceeding and revise our estimate and update our disclosure accordingly significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination to whether loss is reasonably estimable revision in our estimate of the potential liability could materially impact our result of operation income tax we are subject to income tax in the united state and numerous foreign jurisdiction and the assessment of our income tax position involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax law and regulation in various taxing jurisdiction in addition the application of tax law and regulation is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax law and regulation themselves are subject to change result of change in fiscal policy change in legislation the evolution of regulation and court ruling significant judgment and estimate are required in determining our provision for income tax including those related to tax incentive intercompany research and development cost sharing arrangement transfer pricing and tax credit while we believe we have appropriate support for the position taken on our tax return we regularly ass the potential outcome of examination by taxing authority in determining the adequacy of our provision for income tax therefore the actual liability for united state or foreign tax may be materially different from our estimate which could result in the need to record additional tax liability or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liability we are participating in the internal revenue service irs compliance assurance process program whereby we endeavor to agree with the irs on the treatment of all issue prior to filing our federal return benefit of participation in this program is that post filing adjustment by the irs are le likely to occur our qct segment non united state headquarters is located in singapore we obtained tax incentive in singapore that commenced in march including tax exemption for the first five year provided that we meet specified employment and incentive criterion and result of the expiration of certain of these incentive our singapore tax rate increased in fiscal and will increase again in fiscal upon the expiration of the remaining incentive our failure to meet these criterion could adversely impact our provision for income tax we consider the operating earnings of certain non united state subsidiary to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united state based on our plan for use and or investment outside of the united state and our belief that our source of cash and liquidity in the united state will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash need on regular basis we consider projected cash need for among other thing potential acquisition such our proposed acquisition of nxp investment in our existing business future research and development and capital transaction including repurchase of our common stock dividend and debt repayment we estimate the amount of cash or other liquidity that is available or needed in the jurisdiction where these investment are expected well our ability to generate cash in those jurisdiction and our access to capital market this analysis enables to conclude whether or not we will indefinitely reinvest the current period foreign earnings we have not recorded deferred tax liability of approximately billion related to the united state federal and state income tax and foreign withholding tax on approximately billion of undistributed earnings of certain non united state subsidiary indefinitely reinvested outside the united state should we decide to no longer indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the united state for example if we determine that such earnings are needed to fund future domestic operation or there is not sufficient need for such earnings outside of the united state we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we make such determination accounting pronouncementsinformation regarding recent accounting pronouncement and the impact of those pronouncement if any on our consolidated financial statement is provided in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note the company and it significant accounting policy item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskmarketable securitieswe have made investment in

indefinite lived intangible asset is more likely than not likelihood of more than le than it carrying amount quantitative impairment test will be performed if goodwill is quantitatively assessed for impairment two step approach is applied first the company compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to it carrying value the second step if necessary measure the amount of impairment if any by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to it carrying value other indefinite lived intangible asset are quantitatively assessed for impairment if necessary by comparing their estimated fair value to their carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the difference is recorded an impairment long lived asset such property plant and equipment and intangible asset subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of asset to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds it estimated future cash flow an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group long lived asset to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or their
