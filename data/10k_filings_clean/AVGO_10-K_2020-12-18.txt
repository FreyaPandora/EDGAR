product for that leverage our existing technology we anticipate that we will continue to make significant research and development expenditure in order to maintain our competitive position and to ensure continuous flow of innovative and sustainable product platform customer sale and distributionwe sell our product through our direct sale force and select network of distributor and channel partner globally distributor and oems or their contract manufacturer typically account for the substantial majority of our semiconductor sale historically relatively small number of customer have accounted for significant portion of our net revenue sale to distributor accounted for and of our net revenue for fiscal year and respectively we believe our aggregate sale to our top five end customer through all channel accounted for more than of our net revenue for each of our fiscal year and we believe aggregate sale to apple inc through all channel accounted for approximately and of our net revenue for fiscal year and respectively we expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future period the loss of or significant decrease in demand from any of our top five end customer could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition many of our semiconductor customer design product in north america or europe that are manufactured in asia to serve customer around the world we have strategically developed relationship with large global electronic component distributor complemented by number of regional distributor with customer relationship based on their respective product range we also sell our product to wide variety of oems or their contract manufacturer we have established strong relationship

more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth of contentsmanufacturing operationswe focus on maintaining an efficient global supply chain and variable low cost operating model accordingly we outsource majority of our manufacturing operation utilizing third party foundry and assembly and test capability well some of our corporate infrastructure function the majority of our front end wafer manufacturing operation is outsourced to external foundry including taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited tsmc we use third party contract manufacturer for significant majority of our assembly and test operation including advanced semiconductor engineering inc foxconn technology group amkor technology inc and siliconware precision industry co ltd we use our internal fabrication facility for product utilizing our innovative and proprietary process to protect our ip and to accelerate time to market for our product while outsourcing commodity process such standard cmos example of internally fabricated semiconductor include our fbar filter for wireless communication and our vertical cavity surface emitting laser and side emitting laser based on gaas and inp laser for fiber optic communication the majority of our internal iii semiconductor wafer fabrication is done in the and singapore many of our product are designed to be manufactured in specific process typically at one particular foundry either our own or with particular contract manufacturer and in some instance we may qualify one contract manufacturer to manufacture certain of our product we also have long history of operating in asia where approximately of our employee are located and where we manufacture and source the majority of our product and material we store the majority of our product inventory in our warehouse in malaysia and our presence in asia place in close proximity to many of our customer manufacturing facility and at the center of worldwide electronics manufacturing manufacturing material and suppliersour manufacturing operation employ wide variety of semiconductor electromechanical component and assembly and raw material we purchase material from hundred of supplier on global basis these supply relationship are generally conducted on purchase order basis while we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining the material used in the conduct of our business and we believe that no single supplier is material some of the part are not readily available from alternate supplier due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design or qualification our long term relationship with our supplier allow to proactively manage our technology development and product discontinuance plan and to monitor our supplier financial health some supplier may nonetheless extend their lead time limit supply increase price or cease to produce necessary part for our product if these are unique or highly specialized component we may not be able to find substitute quickly or at all to address the potential disruption in our supply chain we may use number of technique including in some case qualifying more than one source of supply redesigning product for alternative component and incremental or in some case lifetime purchase of affected part for supply buffer competitionthe market in which we participate are highly competitive our competitor range from large international company offering wide range of product to smaller company specializing in narrow market the competitive landscape is changing result of trend toward consolidation within many industry some of our competitor have merged with or been acquired by other competitor while others have begun collaborating with each other we expect this consolidation trend to continue we expect competition in the market in which we participate to continue to increase existing competitor improve or expand their product offering and new company enter the market additionally our ability to compete effectively depends on number of factor including quality technical performance price product feature product system compatibility system

offering our platform and hardware independence our global reach and our deep customer relationship and industry experience intellectual propertyour success depends in part upon our ability to protect our ip to accomplish this we rely on combination of ip right including patent copyright trademark service mark trade secret and similar ip well customary contractual protection with our customer supplier employee and consultant and through security measure to protect our trade secret we believe our current product expertise key engineering talent and ip portfolio provide with strong platform from which to develop application specific product in key target market of november we and other patent and and other pending patent application the expiration date of our patent range from to with small number of patent expiring in the near future none of which are expected to be material to our ip portfolio we are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patent we focus our patent application program to greater extent on those invention and improvement that we believe are likely to be incorporated into our product contrasted with more basic research however we do not know how many of our pending patent application will result in the issuance of patent or the extent to which the examination process could require to narrow our claim we and our predecessor have also entered into variety of ip licensing and cross licensing arrangement that have both benefited our business and enabled some of our competitor portion of our revenue come from ip licensing royalty payment and from litigation settlement relating to such ip we also license third party technology that are incorporated into some element of our design activity product and manufacturing process historically license of the third party technology used by have generally been available to on acceptable term the industry in which we compete are characterized by the existence of large number of patent copyright trademark and trade secret and by the vigorous pursuit protection and enforcement of ip right including by patent holding company that do not make or sell product many of our customer agreement require to indemnify our customer for third party ip infringement claim arising from our product claim of this sort could harm our relationship with our customer and might deter future customer from business with with respect to any ip right claim against or our customer or distributor we may be required to defend ourselves or our customer or distributor in litigation cease

patent or other ip right with respect to our infrastructure software the source code for our product is protected both trade secret and copyrighted work except with respect to software component that are subject to open source license our customer do not generally have access to the source code for our product rather on premise customer typically access only the executable code for our product and saas customer access only the functionality of our saas offering under certain contingent circumstance some of our customer are beneficiary of source code escrow arrangement that enables them to obtain limited right to access our source code employeesour future success depends on our ability to retain attract and motivate qualified personnel the source of our technological and product innovation our engineering and technical personnel are significant asset competition for these employee is significant in many area of the world in which we operate particularly in silicon valley and southeast asia where qualified engineer are in high demand we track and report internally on key talent metric including the portion of our workforce in research and development and the voluntary attrition rate during fiscal year our voluntary attrition rate wa below the technology industry benchmark aon salary increase and turnover study second edition september of november we had approximately employee worldwide with approximately of them in research and development by geography approximately of our employee are located in north america in asia and in europe the middle east and africa and significant majority of our research and development personnel are located in czech republic india israel singapore and the of contentsgovernmental regulationour semiconductor manufacturing operation and research and development involve the use of hazardous substance and are regulated under international federal state and local law governing health safety and the environment these regulation include limitation on discharge of pollutant to air water and soil remediation requirement product chemical content limitation manufacturing chemical use and handling restriction pollution control requirement waste minimization consideration and treatment transport storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste we are also subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration and similar health and safety law in other jurisdiction we believe that our property and operation at our facility comply in all material respect with applicable environmental law and worker health and safety law however the risk of environmental liability can not be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental health and safety law to our business will not require to incur significant expenditure we are also regulated under number of international federal state and local law regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirement including legislation enacted in the european union and china among growing number of jurisdiction which have placed greater restriction on the use of lead among other chemical in electronic product which affect material composition and semiconductor packaging in addition our business is subject to various import export regulation such the export administration regulation and applicable executive order and rule of industrial standard body like the international standard organization well regulation by other agency such the federal trade commission ftc these law regulation and order are complex may change frequently and with limited notice have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified under the current administration especially in light of ongoing trade tension with china we may incur significant expenditure in future period result backlogour semiconductor sale are generally made pursuant to short term purchase order these purchase order are made without deposit and may be rescheduled cancelled or modified on relatively short notice without substantial penalty in addition our software contracting model for the majority of our customer which are for enterprise wide license provide for termination thereof by our customer at any time for any reason result we recognize revenue from these contract ratably over time therefore although we may have large backlog from time to time we believe that purchase order or backlog are not necessarily reliable indicator of future sale seasonalityhistorically our net revenue ha typically been higher in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half primarily due to seasonality in our wireless communication product these product have historically experienced seasonality due to launch of new mobile handset manufactured by our oem customer however from time to time typical seasonality and industry cyclicality are overshadowed by other factor such wider macroeconomic effect the timing of significant product transition and launch by large oems particularly with our wireless communication product we have diversified business portfolio and we believe that our overall revenue is le susceptible to seasonal variation result of this diversification other informationour website is www broadcom com you may

business operation and financial result risk related to our business the ongoing covid pandemic ha and will likely continue to negatively impact the global economy and disrupt normal business activity the majority of our sale come from small number of customer and reduction in demand or loss of one or more of our significant customer may adversely affect our business dependence on contract manufacturing and supplier of critical component within our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring product to market we purchase significant amount of the material used in our product from limited number of supplier adverse global economic condition could have negative effect on global political and economic condition and other factor related to our international operation could adversely affect our business is subject to various governmental regulation and trade restriction compliance with these regulation may cause to incur significant expense and if we fail to maintain compliance we may be forced to cease manufacture and distribution of certain product or subjected to civil or criminal penalty we are subject to risk associated with our distributor and other channel partner including product inventory level and product sell through our dependence on senior management and if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively we may pursue acquisition investment joint venture and disposition which could adversely affect our result of operation we may be involved in legal proceeding including ip anti competition and security litigation employee related claim and regulatory investigation our operating result are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuation failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customer demand could adversely affect our result of operation we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturn winning business in the semiconductor solution industry is subject to lengthy process that often requires to incur significant expense from which we may ultimately generate no revenue competition in our industry could prevent from growing our revenue prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facility research and development facility warehouse or other significant operation or those of our supplier could have material adverse effect on we may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity or product yield at our own manufacturing facility any failure of our it system or one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendor to provide necessary service could have material adverse effect on our business our ability to maintain or improve gross margin our ability to protect the significant amount of ip in our business incompatibility of our software product with operating environment platform or third party product demand for our product and service could decrease failure to enter into software license agreement on satisfactory basis could adversely affect of content licensed third party software used in our product may not be available to in the future which may delay product development and production or cause to incur additional expense use of open source code source which under certain circumstance could materially adversely affect we are

information which subject to privacy and data security law and contractual commitment and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such law and commitment could harm our business we are subject to environmental health and safety law which could increase our cost restrict our operation and require expenditure social and environmental responsibility regulation policy and provision well customer demand may make our supply chain more complex and may adversely affect our relationship with customer the average selling price of semiconductor product in our market have often decreased rapidly and may do so in the future breach of our security system may have material adverse effect on our business fluctuation in foreign exchange rate could result in loss risk relating to tax change in tax legislation or policy could materially impact our financial position and result of operation our corporate income tax could significantly increase if we are unable to maintain our tax concession or if our assumption and interpretation regarding tax law and concession prove to be incorrect our benefit from income tax and overall cash tax cost are affected by number of factor that could materially adversely affect financial result risk relating to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to execute our business strategy the instrument governing our indebtedness impose certain restriction on our business servicing our debt requires significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt risk relating to owning our common stock volatility of our stock price could result in substantial loss for our investor well class action litigation against and our management substantial amount of our stock is held by small number of large investor there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividend for more complete discussion of the material risk facing our business see below risk related to our businessthe ongoing covid pandemic ha and will likely continue to negatively impact the global economy and disrupt normal business activity which may have an adverse effect on our result of operation the global spread of covid and the effort to control it have slowed global economic activity and disrupted and reduced the efficiency of normal business activity in much of the world the pandemic ha resulted in authority around the world implementing numerous unprecedented measure such travel restriction quarantine shelter in place order and factory and office shutdown these measure have impacted and will likely continue to impact our workforce and operation and those of our customer contract manufacturer cm supplier and logistics provider particularly in the event of significant global resurgence of the illness of contentswe have been and expect to continue experiencing some disruption to part of our global semiconductor supply chain with supplier increasing lead time or placing product on allocation including procuring necessary component and input such wafer and substrate in timely fashion in addition our primary warehouse and number of our key supplier particularly assembly and test service provider are in malaysia while our malaysia warehouse ha remained fully operational many of the facility of our key supplier and other service provider were shut or operated at reduced capacity for extended period this resulted in significant logistical challenge and product delay which could recur in the event of any future closure of or period of reduced operation at our warehouse or the facility of our supplier and provider any similar disruption at our fort collins colorado manufacturing facility would severely impact our ability to manufacture our fbar product and adversely affect our wireless business in addition disruption to commercial transportation infrastructure have increased delivery time for material and component to our facility transfer of our product to our key supplier and in some case our ability to timely ship our product to customer result of these supply chain disruption we have increased customer order lead time and placed some product on allocation we are also largely building semiconductor product to order instead of based on customer forecast in light of the ongoing uncertainty this may limit our ability to fulfill order and we may be unable to satisfy all of the demand for our product which may adversely affect our relationship with our customer in response to governmental directive and recommended safety measure we modified our workplace practice globally which ha resulted in many of our employee working remotely for extended period of time while we have implemented phased in return of employee to many of our facility if the spread of covid worsens significantly we may need to limit onsite operation or otherwise modify our business practice in manner that may adversely impact our business working remotely for extended period may reduce our employee efficiency and productivity which may cause product development delay hamper new product innovation and have other unforeseen adverse effect on our business in addition if significant number of our employee or employee and third party performing key function including our ceo and member of our board of director become ill our business may be further adversely impacted while we have implemented personal safety measure at all of our facility where our employee are working onsite any action we take may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of infection and could result in significant number of covid related claim change to state worker compensation law have recently occurred in california may increase our potential liability for such claim in the longer term the covid pandemic is likely to adversely affect the economy and financial market of many country and could result in global economic downturn and recession this would likely adversely affect demand for our product and those of our customer particularly consumer product such smartphones which may in turn negatively impact our result of operation however there is significant degree of uncertainty and lack of visibility to the extent and duration of any such downturn or recession while we continue to see robust demand in our semiconductor segment and have seen little impact to our software business from the covid pandemic the environment remains uncertain and it may not be sustainable over the longer term the degree to which the pandemic ultimately impact our business and result of operation will depend on future development beyond our control including the severity of the pandemic the extent of action to contain the virus availability of vaccine or other treatment how quickly and to extent normal economic and operating condition can resume and the severity and duration of the global economic downturn that result from the pandemic the majority of our sale come from small number of customer and reduction in demand or loss of one or more of our significant customer may adversely affect our business we are dependent on small number of end customer oems their respective cm and certain distributor for majority of our business revenue and result of operation for fiscal year sale to distributor accounted for of our net revenue we believe aggregate sale through all channel to apple and our top five end customer accounted for approximately and more than of our net revenue for fiscal year respectively this customer concentration increase the risk of quarterly fluctuation in our operating result and our sensitivity to any material adverse development experienced by our significant customer the term and condition under which we do business with most of our semiconductor customer generally do not include commitment by those customer to purchase any specific quantity of product from even in those instance where we enter into an arrangement under which customer agrees to source an agreed portion of it product need from provided that we are able to meet specified development supply and quality commitment the arrangement often includes pricing schedule or methodology that apply regardless of the volume of product purchased and those customer may not purchase the amount of product we expect result we may not generate the amount of revenue or the level of profitability we expect under such arrangement moreover our top customer purchasing power ha in some case given them the ability to make greater demand on with regard to pricing and contractual term in general we expect this trend to continue which may adversely affect our gross margin on certain product and should we fail to perform under these arrangement we could also be liable for significant monetary damage of contentsthe loss of or any substantial reduction in sale to any of our major customer could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow dependence on contract manufacturing and supplier of critical component within our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring product to market damage our reputation and adversely affect our result of operation we operate primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes cm such third party wafer foundry and module assembly and test capability our semiconductor product require wafer manufacturer with state of the art fabrication equipment and technique and most of our product are designed to be manufactured in specific process typically at one particular fab or foundry either our own or with particular cm we depend on our cm to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our need to produce product of acceptable quality at acceptable yield and to deliver those product to on timely basis we do not generally have long term capacity commitment with our cm and substantially all of our manufacturing service are on purchase order basis with no obligation to provide with any specified minimum quantity of product further from time to time our cm will cease to or will become unable to manufacture component for the lead time needed to identify qualify and establish reliable production at acceptable yield with new cm is typically lengthy there is often no readily available alternative source and there may be other constraint on our ability to change cm in addition qualifying such cm is often expensive and they may not produce product cost effectively our current supplier in any such circumstance we may be unable to meet our customer demand and may fail to meet our contractual obligation this could result in the payment of significant damage by to our customer and our net revenue could decline adversely affecting our business financial condition and result of operation we utilize tsmc to produce the substantial majority of our semiconductor wafer tsmc manufactured approximately of the wafer manufactured by our cm during fiscal year our wafer requirement represent significant portion of the total production capacity of tsmc however tsmc also fabricates wafer for other company including certain of our competitor and could choose to prioritize capacity for other customer or reduce or eliminate delivery to on short notice or raise their price to all of which could harm our business result of operation and gross margin for example huawei technology co ltd huawei well many of it supplier have significantly increased their wafer order from tsmc due to certain export restriction on sale to huawei this ha caused and may continue to cause some dislocation in the semiconductor supply chain which may result in reduced or untimely wafer delivery to any substantial disruption in tsmc supply of wafer to or in the other contract manufacturing service that we utilize result of natural disaster political unrest military conflict geopolitical turmoil trade tension medical epidemic such the covid pandemic climate change economic instability equipment failure or other cause could materially harm our business customer relationship and result of operation we also depend on our cm to timely develop new advanced manufacturing process including in the case of wafer fabrication transition to smaller geometry process technology if these new process are not timely developed or we do not have sufficient access to them we may be unable to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the extent our competitor or to deliver product to our customer which could result in loss of revenue opportunity and damage our relationship with our customer we purchase significant amount of the material used in our product from limited number of supplier our manufacturing process and those of our cm rely on many material including silicon gaas and inp wafer copper lead frame precious and rare earth metal mold compound ceramic package and various chemical and gas we purchase significant portion of our material component and finished good used in our product from material provider some of which are single source supplier certain material are highly specialized the lead time needed to identify and qualify new supplier is typically lengthy and there is often no readily available alternative source during fiscal year we purchased approximately two third of the material for our manufacturing process from six material provider we do not generally have long term contract with our material provider and substantially all of our purchase are on purchase order basis supplier may extend lead time limit supply place product on allocation or increase price due to commodity price increase capacity constraint or other factor and could lead to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry for example due to the covid pandemic we have experienced some supply constraint including with respect to wafer and substrate additionally the supply of these material may be negatively impacted by increased trade tension between the and it trading partner particularly china in the event that we can not timely obtain sufficient quantity of material or at reasonable price the quality of the material deteriorates or we are not able to pas on higher material or energy cost to our customer our business financial condition and result of operation could be adversely impacted of contentsadverse global economic condition could have negative effect on our business result of operation and financial condition and liquidity general slowdown in the global economy or in particular region or industry an increase in trade tension with trading partner or tightening of the credit market could negatively impact our business financial condition and liquidity adverse global economic condition have from time to time caused or exacerbated significant slowdown in the industry and market in which we operate which have adversely affected our business and result of operation in recent period investor and customer concern about the global economic outlook which have significantly increased result of the covid pandemic have adversely affected market and business condition in general macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for to accurately forecast revenue gross margin and expense and may make it more difficult to raise or refinance debt an escalation of trade tension between the and china ha resulted in trade restriction and increased tariff that harm our ability to participate in chinese market or compete effectively with chinese company sustained uncertainty about or worsening of current global economic condition and further escalation of trade tension between the and it trading partner especially china and possible decoupling of the and china economy could result in global economic slowdown and long term change to global trade such event may also cause our customer and consumer to reduce delay or forgo technology spending ii result in customer sourcing product from other supplier not subject to such restriction or tariff iii lead to the insolvency or consolidation of key supplier and customer and iv intensify pricing pressure any or all of these factor could negatively affect demand for our product and our business financial condition and result of operation global political and economic condition and other factor related to our international operation could adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation majority of our product are produced sourced and sold internationally and our international revenue represents significant percentage of our overall revenue in addition of november approximately of our employee were located outside the multiple factor relating to our international operation and to particular country in which we operate could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation these factor include change in political regulatory legal or economic condition or geopolitical turmoil including terrorism war or political or military coup or civil disturbance or political instability foreign and domestic restrictive governmental action such restriction on the transfer or repatriation of fund and foreign investment data privacy regulation and trade protection measure including increasing protectionism import export restriction import export duty and quota trade sanction and custom duty and tariff all of which have increased under the current administration difficulty in obtaining product distribution and support and transportation delay potential inability to localize software product for significant number of international market difficulty in conducting due diligence with respect to business partner in certain international market public health or safety concern medical epidemic or pandemic such covid and other natural or man made disaster nationalization of business and expropriation of asset and change in and foreign tax law significant legal risk associated with conducting business internationally is compliance with the various and differing law and regulation of the many country in which we do business in addition the law in various country are constantly evolving and may in some case conflict with each other although our policy prohibit our employee and our agent from engaging in unethical business practice there can be no assurance that all of our employee distributor or other agent will refrain from acting in violation of our related anti corruption or other policy and procedure any such violation could have material adverse effect on our business our business is subject to various governmental regulation and compliance with these regulation may cause to incur significant expense if we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulation we may be forced to cease the manufacture and distribution of certain product and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalty our business is subject to various international law and other legal requirement including packaging product content labor and import export regulation such the export administration regulation and applicable executive order these law regulation and order are complex may change frequently and with limited notice have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified under the current administration especially in light of ongoing trade tension of contentswith china we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with or to remedy violation of these regulation in addition if our customer fail to comply with these regulation we may be required to suspend sale to these customer which could damage our reputation and negatively impact our result of operation for example huawei one of our customer is subject to certain export restriction which ha required to suspend sale to huawei we obtain license from the department of commerce which we may be unable to do so in timely manner or at all the government may also add additional chinese company to it restricted entity list and or technology to it list of prohibited export to china all of which have and will adversely affect our ability to sell our product and our revenue these restrictive governmental action and any similar measure that may be imposed on company by the chinese or other government will likely limit or prevent from doing business with certain of our customer or supplier and harm our ability to compete effectively or otherwise negatively affect our ability to sell our product and adversely affect our business and result of operation in addition the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductor must comply with various law and adapt to change in regulatory requirement they occur for example if country in which our product are manufactured or sold set technical standard that are not widely shared it may require to stop distributing our product commercially until they comply with such new standard lead certain of our customer to suspend import of their product into that country require manufacturer in that country to manufacture product with different technical standard and disrupt cross border manufacturing relationship any of which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation if we fail to comply with these requirement we could also be required to pay civil penalty or face criminal prosecution our product and operation are also subject to the rule of industrial standard body like the international standard organization well regulation by other agency such the ftc if we fail to adequately address any of these rule or regulation our business could be harmed we are subject to risk associated with our distributor and other channel partner including product inventory level and product sell through we sell our product through direct sale force and select network of distributor and other channel partner globally sale to distributor accounted for of our net revenue in the fiscal year ended november and are subject to number of risk including fluctuation in demand based on our distributor product inventory level and end customer demand in given quarter our distributor and other channel partner are generally not subject to minimum sale requirement or any obligation to market our product to their customer our distributor and other channel partner agreement are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our product to end customer and our distributor and other channel partner may market and distribute competing product and may place greater emphasis on the sale of these product in addition we are selling our semiconductor product through an increasingly limited number of distributor which expose to additional customer concentration and related credit risk we do not always have direct relationship with the end customer of our product result our semiconductor product may be used in application for which they were not necessarily designed or tested including for example medical device and they may not perform anticipated in such application in such event failure of even small number of part could result in significant liability to damage our reputation and harm our business and result of operation our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing member of our senior management team our success depends in large part on the continued contribution of our senior management team and in particular the service of mr hock tan our president and chief executive officer effective succession planning is also important for our long term success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transition involving senior management could hinder our strategic planning and execution none of our senior management is bound by written employment contract in addition we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our senior management the loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market condition in which we operate of contentsif we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel especially our engineering and technical personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively our future success depends on our ability to retain attract and motivate qualified personnel we also seek to acquire talented engineering and technical personnel including cyber security expert well effective sale professional through acquisition we may make from time to time or otherwise the source of our technological and product innovation our engineering and technical personnel are significant asset competition for these employee is significant in many area of the world in which we operate particularly in silicon valley and southeast asia where qualified engineer are in high demand in addition current or future immigration law may make it more difficult to hire or retain qualified engineer further limiting the pool of available talent further our employee may decide not to continue working for and may leave with little or no notice we grant equity award to the substantial majority of our employee and we believe these award provide powerful long term retention incentive to our employee however we may be incorrect in this assumption particularly if there is material and persistent decline in the price of our common stock in addition we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approval of future equity compensation plan needed to continue with our current equity granting philosophy result we may be limited in our ability to grant equity based incentive which may impair our effort to attract and retain necessary personnel any inability to retain attract or motivate such personnel could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation we may pursue acquisition investment joint venture and disposition which could adversely affect our result of operation our growth strategy includes acquiring or investing in business that offer complementary product service and technology or enhance our market coverage or technological capability any acquisition we may undertake and their integration involve risk and uncertainty such unexpected delay challenge and related expense and disruption of our business diversion of management attention from daily operation and the pursuit of other opportunity incurring significant restructuring charge and amortization expense assuming liability some of which may be unexpected and ongoing or new lawsuit related to the transaction or otherwise potential impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible asset and increasing our expense and working capital requirement the potential for deficiency in internal control at the acquired business well implementing our own management information system operating system and internal control for the acquired operation our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issue with the acquired company product financial disclosure accounting practice legal tax and other contingency compliance with local law and regulation and interpretation thereof in the and multiple international jurisdiction additional acquisition related debt which could increase our leverage and potentially negatively affect our credit rating resulting in more restrictive borrowing term or increased borrowing cost thereby limiting our ability to borrow dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholder difficulty integrating the acquired business or company and in managing and retaining acquired employee vendor and customer and inaccuracy in our original estimate and assumption used to ass transaction which may result in not realizing the expected financial or strategic benefit of any such transaction in addition and foreign regulatory approval required in connection with an acquisition may take longer than anticipated to obtain may not be forthcoming or may contain burdensome condition which may jeopardize delay or reduce the anticipated benefit of the transaction to from time to time we may also seek to divest or wind down portion of our business either acquired or otherwise or we may exit minority investment any of which could materially affect our cash flow and result of operation such disposition involve risk and uncertainty including our ability to sell such business on term acceptable to or at all disruption to other part of our business potential loss of employee or customer or exposure to unanticipated liability or ongoing obligation to following any such disposition in addition disposition may include the transfer of technology and or the licensing of certain ip right to third party purchaser which could limit our ability to utilize such ip right or assert these right against such third party purchaser or other third party of contentswe may be involved in legal proceeding including ip anti competition and security litigation employee related claim and regulatory investigation which could among other thing divert effort of management and result in significant expense and loss of our ip right we are often involved in legal proceeding including case involving our ip right and those of others anti competition and commercial matter acquisition related suit security class action suit employee related claim and other action from time to time we may also be involved or required to participate in regulatory investigation or inquiry such the ongoing investigation by the ftc into certain of our contracting and business practice which may evolve into legal or other administrative proceeding growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporation is likely to result in increased anti competition legislation regulation and enforcement activity litigation or settlement of such action regardless of their merit or involvement in regulatory investigation or inquiry can be costly lengthy complex and time consuming diverting the attention and energy of our management and technical personnel the industry in which we operate are characterized by company holding large number of patent copyright trademark and trade secret and by the vigorous pursuit protection and enforcement of ip right including action by patent holding company that do not make or sell product from time to time third party assert against and our customer and distributor their ip right to technology that are important to our business for example in august judgment wa entered against broadcom and apple for infringement of certain patent pursuant to which california institute of technology wa awarded past damage of million from broadcom and million from apple plus in each case interest thereon from the date of the judgment for which apple is seeking indemnification from broadcom although we are appealing this judgment there are no assurance that we will be successful many of our customer agreement and in some case our asset sale agreement and or the law of certain jurisdiction may require to indemnify our customer or purchaser for third party ip infringement claim including cost to defend those claim and payment of damage in the case of adverse ruling however our cm and supplier may or may not be required to indemnify should we or our customer be subject to such third party claim claim of this sort could also harm our relationship with our customer and might deter future customer from doing business with if any pending or future proceeding result in an adverse outcome we could be required to cease the manufacture use or sale of the infringing product process or technology and or make change to our process or product pay substantial damage for past present and future use of the infringing technology including to treble damage if willful infringement is found pay fine or disgorge profit or other payment and or cease certain conduct and or modify our contracting or business practice in connection with any unfavorable resolution of governmental investigation expend significant resource to develop non infringing technology license technology from the third party claiming infringement which license may not be available on commercially reasonable term or at all enter into cross license with our competitor which could weaken our overall ip portfolio and our ability to compete in particular product category pay substantial damage to our direct or end customer to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non infringing technology or relinquish ip right associated with one or more of our patent claim any of the foregoing result could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation in addition we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former director or employee or former director or employee of company that we have acquired in connection with litigation or regulatory investigation these liability could be substantial and may include among other thing the cost of defending lawsuit against these individual well stockholder derivative suit the cost of government law enforcement or regulatory investigation civil or criminal fine and penalty legal and other expense and expense associated with the remedial measure if any which may be imposed our operating result are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuation our operating result have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future these fluctuation may occur on quarterly and annual basis and are due to number of factor many of which are beyond our control in addition to many of the risk described elsewhere in this risk factor section these factor include among others of content customer concentration and the gain or loss of significant customer the timing of launch by our customer of new product in which our product are included and change in end user demand for our customer the product fluctuation in the level of component or product inventory held by our customer the shift to cloud based it solution and service such hyperscale computing which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sale of our product for use in traditional enterprise data center the timing of new software contract and renewal well the timing of any termination of software contract that require to refund to customer any pre paid amount under the contract our ability to timely develop introduce and market new product and technology the timing and extent of our software license and subscription revenue and other non product revenue new product announcement and introduction by or our competitor seasonality or other fluctuation in demand in our market timing and amount of research and development and related new product expenditure and the timing of receipt of any research and development grant monies and timing of any regulatory change particularly with respect to trade sanction and custom duty and tariff and tax reform the foregoing factor are often difficult to predict and these well other factor could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating result in addition significant amount of our operating expense are relatively fixed in nature any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our result of operation result we believe that quarter to quarter comparison of our revenue and operating result may not be meaningful or reliable indicator of our future performance if our operating result in one or more future quarter fail to meet the expectation of security analyst or investor significant decline in the trading price of our common stock may occur which may happen immediately or over time failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customer demand could adversely affect our result of operation we make significant decision including determining the level of business that we will seek and accept production schedule level of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirement based on our estimate of customer requirement which may not be accurate during the covid pandemic we have moved largely to build to order model and have extended customer lead time substantially in light of global economic uncertainty and supply chain challenge more typically however to ensure the availability of our product we start manufacturing based on customer forecast which are not binding result we incur inventory and manufacturing cost in advance of anticipated sale that may be substantially lower than expected if actual demand for our product is lower than forecast we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating cost and product obsolescence certain of our sale research and development and internal manufacturing overhead expense are relatively fixed reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income conversely customer often require rapid increase in production on short notice we may be unable to secure sufficient material or contract manufacturing or test capacity to meet such increase in demand this could damage our customer relationship reduce revenue growth and margin subject to additional liability harm our reputation and prevent from taking advantage of opportunity we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturn the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change and price erosion evolving technical standard frequent new product introduction short product life cycle for semiconductor and for many of the end product in which they are used and wide fluctuation in product supply and demand from time to time these factor together with change in general economic condition cause significant upturn and downturn in the industry in general and in our business in particular period of industry downturn have been characterized by diminished demand for end user product high inventory level and period of inventory adjustment under utilization of manufacturing capacity change in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling price we expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturn even overall economic condition are relatively stable if we can not offset industry or market downturn our net revenue may decline and our financial condition and result of operation may suffer of contentswinning business in the semiconductor solution industry is subject to lengthy process that often requires to incur significant expense from which we may ultimately generate no revenue our semiconductor business is dependent on winning competitive bid selection process known design win these selection process are typically lengthy and can require to dedicate significant development expenditure and scarce engineering resource in pursuit of single customer opportunity failure to obtain particular design win may prevent from obtaining design win in subsequent generation of particular product this can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection process winning product design doe not guarantee sale to customer delay or cancellation of customer plan could materially and adversely affect our financial result we incur significant expense in the design process and may generate little or no revenue from it in addition the timing of design win is unpredictable and implementing production for major design win or multiple design win at the same time may strain our resource and those of our cm in such event we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resource and incur additional cost and expense further often customer will only purchase limited number of evaluation unit until they qualify the product and or the manufacturing line for those product the qualification process can take significant time and resource delay in qualification or failure to qualify our product may cause customer to discontinue use of our product and result in significant loss of revenue finally customer could choose at any time to stop using our product or could fail to successfully market and sell their product which could reduce demand for our product and cause to hold excess inventory materially adversely affecting our business financial condition and result of operation these risk are exacerbated by the fact that many of our product and the end product into which our product are incorporated often have very short life cycle competition in our industry could prevent from growing our revenue the industry in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standard change in customer requirement often aggressive pricing practice and in some case new delivery method we expect competition in these industry to continue to increase existing competitor improve or expand their product offering or new competitor enter our market some of our competitor have longer operating history greater name recognition larger installed customer base larger technical staff more established relationship with vendor or supplier or greater manufacturing distribution financial research and development technical and marketing resource than we also face competition from numerous smaller company that specialize in specific aspect of the highly fragmented software industry open source author who may provide software and ip for free competitor who may offer their product through try and buy or freemium model and customer who may develop competing product in addition the trend toward consolidation is changing the competitive landscape we expect this trend to continue which may result in combined competitor greater resource than some of our competitor may also receive financial and other support from their home country government or may have greater presence in key market larger customer base more comprehensive ip portfolio or better patent protection than the action of our competitor in the area of pricing and product bundling in particular could have substantial adverse impact on further competitor may leverage their superior market position well ip or other proprietary information including interface interoperability or technical information in new and emerging technology and platform that may inhibit our ability to compete effectively if we are unable to compete successfully we may lose market share for our product or incur significant reduction in our gross margin either of which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facility research and development facility warehouse or other significant operation or those of our supplier could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation although we operate primarily outsourced manufacturing business model we also rely on our own manufacturing facility in particular in fort collins colorado singapore and breinigsville pennsylvania we use these internal fabrication facility for product utilizing our innovative and proprietary process our fort collins and breinigsville facility are the sole source for the fbar component used in many of our wireless device and for the indium phosphide based wafer used in our fibre optic product respectively many of our facility and those of our cm and supplier are located in california and the pacific rim region which have average seismic activity and severe weather activity in addition significant majority of our research and development personnel are located the czech republic india israel singapore and the with the expertise of the personnel at each such location tending to be focused on one or two specific area and our primary warehouse is in malaysia of contentsa prolonged disruption at or shut down of one or more of our manufacturing facility or warehouse for any reason especially our colorado singapore malaysia and pennsylvania facility or those of our cm or supplier due to natural or man made disaster or other event outside of our control such equipment malfunction or widespread outbreak of acute illness including covid would limit our capacity to meet customer demand and delay new product development until replacement facility and equipment if necessary were found any such event would likely disrupt our operation delay production shipment and revenue result in unable to timely satisfy customer demand expose to claim by our customer result in significant expense to repair or replace our affected facility and in some instance could significantly curtail our research and development effort in particular product area or target market result we could forgo revenue opportunity potentially lose market share damage our customer relationship and be subject to litigation and additional liability all of which could materially and adversely affect our business although we purchase insurance to mitigate certain loss such insurance often carry high deductible amount and any uninsured loss could negatively affect our operating result in addition even if we were able to promptly resume production of our affected product if our customer can not timely resume their own manufacturing following such an event they may cancel or scale back their order from and this may in turn adversely affect our result of operation such event could also result in increased fixed cost relative to the revenue we generate and adversely affect our result of operation we may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity or product yield at our own manufacturing facility which could adversely affect our relationship with our customer and our business financial condition and result of operation we must maintain appropriate capacity and product yield at our own manufacturing facility to meet anticipated customer demand from time to time this requires to invest in expansion or improvement of those facility which often involves substantial cost and other risk such expanded manufacturing capacity may still be insufficient or may not come online soon enough to meet customer demand and we may have to put customer on product allocation forgo sale or lose customer result conversely if we overestimate customer demand we would experience excess capacity and fixed cost at these facility will not be fully absorbed all of which could adversely affect our result of operation similarly reduced product yield due to design or manufacturing issue or otherwise may involve significant time and cost to remedy and cause delay in our ability to supply product to our customer all of which could cause to forgo sale incur liability or lose customer and harm our result of operation in addition future government restriction imposed result of the covid pandemic that limit our manufacturing capability could severely impact our ability to manufacture our proprietary product adversely affecting our wireless business any failure of our it system or one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendor to provide necessary service could have material adverse effect on our business our business depends on various it system and outsourced it service we rely on third party vendor to provide critical corporate infrastructure service and to adequately address cyber security threat to their own system service provided by these third party include service related to financial reporting product order and shipping human resource benefit plan administration it network development and network monitoring while we may be entitled to damage if our vendor fail to perform under their agreement with any award may be insufficient to cover the actual cost incurred by and result of vendor failure to perform we may be unable to collect any damage any failure of these internal or third party system and service to operate effectively could disrupt our operation and could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation our gross margin is dependent on number of factor including our product mix price erosion acquisition we may make level of capacity utilization and commodity price our gross margin is highly dependent on product mix which is susceptible to seasonal and other fluctuation in our market shift in sale mix away from our higher margin product well the timing and amount of our software licensing and non product revenue could adversely affect our future gross margin percentage in addition increased competition and the existence of product alternative more complex engineering requirement lower demand or reduction in our technological lead compared to our competitor and other factor may lead to further price erosion lower revenue and lower margin in addition semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment leading to high fixed cost including depreciation expense if we are unable to utilize our owned manufacturing facility at high level the fixed cost associated with these facility will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit cost and lower gross margin furthermore fluctuation in commodity price could negatively impact our margin we do not hedge our exposure to commodity price some of which are very volatile and sudden or prolonged increase in commodity price may adversely affect our gross margin of contentsour gross margin may also be adversely affected if business or company that we acquire have different gross margin profile and by expense related to such acquisition we utilize significant amount of ip in our business if we are unable or fail to protect our ip our business could be adversely affected our success depends in part upon protecting our ip to accomplish this we rely on combination of ip right including patent copyright trademark and trade secret well customary contractual protection with our customer supplier employee and consultant we may be required to spend significant resource to monitor and protect our ip right including unauthorized use of our product the usage rate of the software seat license and subscription that we sell and even with significant expenditure we may not be able to protect the ip right that are valuable to our business we are unable to predict or assure that our ip right will not lapse or be invalidated circumvented challenged or in the case of third party ip right licensed to be licensed to others our ip right will provide competitive advantage to right previously granted by third party to ip licensed or assigned to including portfolio cross license will not hamper our ability to assert our ip right or hinder the settlement of currently pending or future dispute any of our pending or future patent trademark or copyright application will be issued or have the coverage originally sought our ip right will be enforced in certain jurisdiction where competition may be intense or where legal protection may be weak or we have sufficient ip right to protect our product or our business effective ip protection may be unavailable or more limited in other jurisdiction relative to those protection available in the and may not be applied for or may be abandoned in one or more relevant jurisdiction in addition when patent expire we lose the protection and competitive advantage they provided to we also generate revenue from licensing royalty payment and from technology claim settlement relating to certain of our ip licensing of our ip right particularly exclusive license may limit our ability to assert those ip right against third party including the licensee of those right in addition we may acquire company with ip that is subject to licensing obligation to other third party these licensing obligation may extend to our own ip following any such acquisition and may limit our ability to assert our ip right from time to time we pursue litigation to assert our ip right including in some case against our customer and supplier claim of this sort could also harm our relationship with our customer and might deter future customer from doing business with conversely third party may pursue ip litigation against including result of our ip licensing business an adverse decision in such type of legal action could limit our ability to assert our ip right and limit the value of our technology including the loss of opportunity to sell or license our technology to others or to collect royalty payment which could otherwise negatively impact our business financial condition and result of operation from time to time we may need to obtain additional ip license or renew existing license agreement we are unable to predict whether these license agreement can be obtained or renewed on acceptable term or at all if our software product do not remain compatible with ever changing operating environment platform or third party product demand for our product and service could decrease which could materially adversely affect our business we may be required to make substantial modification of our product to maintain compatibility with operating system system software and computer hardware used by our customer or to provide our customer with desired feature or capability we must also continually address the challenge of dynamic and accelerating market trend and competitive development such the emergence of advanced persistent threat in the security space to compete effectively there can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt our product in response to these development further our software solution interact with variety of software and hardware developed by third party if we lose access to third party code and specification for the development of code this could negatively impact our ability to develop compatible software in addition if software provider and hardware manufacturer including some of our largest vendor adopt new policy restricting the use or availability of their code or technical documentation for their operating system application or hardware or otherwise impose unfavorable term and condition for such access this could result in higher research and development cost for the enhancement and modification of our existing product or development of new product any additional restriction could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result and cash flow failure to enter into software license agreement on satisfactory basis could materially adversely affect our business of contentsmany of our existing customer have multi year enterprise software license agreement some of which involve substantial aggregate fee amount customer renewal rate may decline or fluctuate result of number of factor including the level of customer satisfaction with our solution or customer support customer budget and the pricing of our solution compared with the solution offered by our competitor any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected if at all the failure to renew customer agreement of similar scope on term that are commercially attractive to could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result and cash flow certain software that we use in our product is licensed from third party and may not be available to in the future which may delay product development and production or cause to incur additional expense some of our solution contain software licensed from third party some of which may not be available to in the future on term that are acceptable to or allow our product to remain competitive the loss of these license or the inability to maintain any of them on commercially acceptable term could delay development of future product or the enhancement of existing product certain software we use is from open source code source which under certain circumstance could materially adversely affect our business financial condition operating result and cash flow some of our product contain software from open source code source the use of which may subject to certain condition including the obligation to offer such product for no cost or to make the proprietary source code of those product publicly available further although some open source vendor provide warranty and support agreement it is common for such software to be available is with no warranty indemnity or support although we monitor our use of such open source code to avoid subjecting our product to unintended condition such use under certain circumstance could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result and cash flow including if we are required to take remedial action that may divert resource away from our development effort we are subject to warranty claim product recall and product liability from time to time we may be subject to warranty or product liability claim that may lead to significant expense our customer contract typically contain warranty and indemnification provision and in certain case may also contain liquidated damage provision relating to product quality issue the potential liability associated with such provision are significant and in some case including in agreement with some of our largest customer are potentially unlimited any such liability may greatly exceed any revenue we receive from the relevant product cost payment or damage incurred or paid by in connection with warranty and product liability claim and product recall could materially adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation we may also be exposed to such claim result of any acquisition we may undertake in the future product liability insurance is subject to significant deductible and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claim or we may elect to self insure with respect to certain matter for example it is possible for one of our customer to recall product containing one of our semiconductor device in such an event we may incur significant cost and expense including among others replacement cost contract damage claim from our customer and reputational harm although we maintain reserve for reasonably estimable liability and purchase product liability insurance our reserve may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claim conversely in some case amount we reserve may ultimately exceed our actual liability for particular claim and may need to be reversed the complexity of our product could result in unforeseen delay or expense or undetected defect or bug which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new product damage our reputation with current or prospective customer and materially and adversely affect our operating cost highly complex product such those we offer may contain defect and bug when they are first introduced or new version software documentation or enhancement are released or their release may be delayed due to unforeseen difficulty during product development if any of our product or third party component used in our product contain defect or bug or have reliability quality or compatibility problem we may not be able to successfully design workarounds furthermore if any of these problem are not discovered until after we have commenced commercial production or deployment of new product we may be required to incur additional development cost and product recall repair or replacement cost significant technical challenge also arise with our software product because our customer license and deploy our product across variety of computer platform and integrate them with number of third party software application and database result if there is system wide failure or an actual or perceived breach of information integrity security or availability occurs in one of our end user customer system it may be difficult to determine which product is at fault and we could ultimately be harmed by the failure of another supplier product consequently our reputation may be damaged and customer may be reluctant to buy our product which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customer and attract new customer to resolve these problem we may have to invest significant capital and other resource and we would likely lose or experience delay in market acceptance of the affected of contentsproduct or product these problem may also result in claim against by our customer or others for example if delay in the manufacture and delivery of our product cause the delay of customer end product delivery we may be required under the term of our agreement with that customer to compensate the customer for the adverse effect of such delay result our financial result could be materially adversely affected we make substantial investment in research and development and unsuccessful investment could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation the industry in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change change in customer requirement frequent new product introduction and enhancement short product cycle and evolving industry standard and new delivery method in addition semiconductor product transition over time to increasingly smaller line width geometry and failure to successfully transition to smaller geometry process technology could impair our competitive position in order to remain competitive we have made and expect to continue to make significant investment in research and development if we fail to develop new and enhanced product and technology if we focus on technology that do not become widely adopted or if new competitive technology that we do not support become widely accepted demand for our product may be reduced increased investment in research and development or unsuccessful research and development effort could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our product which would have negative impact on our financial result we collect use store or otherwise process personal information which subject to privacy and data security law and contractual commitment and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such law and commitment could harm our business we collect use and store collectively process high volume variety and velocity of certain personal information in connection with the operation of our business this creates various level of privacy risk across different part of our business depending on the type of personal information the jurisdiction in question and the purpose of their processing the personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal state local and foreign law and regulation regarding privacy and data security well contractual commitment privacy legislation and other data protection regulation enforcement and policy activity in this area are expanding rapidly in many jurisdiction and creating complex regulatory compliance environment the cost of complying with and implementing these privacy related and data governance measure could be significant they may create additional burdensome security business process business record or data localization requirement concern about government interference sovereignty expanding privacy cyber security and data governance legislation could adversely affect our customer and our product and service particularly in cloud computing artificial intelligence and our own data management practice the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by to run our business could result in significantly increased business and security cost or cost related to defending legal claim any inadvertent failure or perceived failure by to comply with privacy data governance or cyber security obligation may result in governmental enforcement action litigation substantial fine and damage and could cause our customer to lose trust in which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business we are subject to environmental health and safety law which could increase our cost restrict our operation and require expenditure that could have material adverse effect on our result of operation and financial condition we are subject to variety of international law and regulation relating to the use disposal clean up of and human exposure to hazardous material compliance with environmental health and safety requirement could among other thing require to modify our manufacturing process restrict our ability to expand our facility or require to acquire pollution control equipment all of which can be very costly any failure by to comply with such requirement could result in the limitation or suspension of the manufacture of our product and could result in litigation against and the payment of significant fine and damage by in the event of significant adverse judgment in addition complying with any cleanup or remediation obligation for which we are or become responsible could be costly and have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation changing requirement relating to the material composition of our semiconductor product including the restriction on lead and certain other substance in electronic product sold in various country including the china and japan and in the european union increase the complexity and cost of our product design and procurement operation and may require to re engineer our product such re engineering may result in excess inventory or other additional cost and could have material adverse effect on our result of operation we may also experience claim from employee from time to time with regard to exposure to hazardous material or other workplace related environmental claim social and environmental responsibility regulation policy and provision well customer demand may make our supply chain more complex and may adversely affect our relationship with customer there is an increasing focus on corporate social and environmental responsibility in the semiconductor industry particularly with oems that manufacture consumer electronics number of our customer have adopted or may adopt of contentsprocurement policy that include social and environmental responsibility provision that their supplier should comply with or they may seek to include such provision in their procurement term and condition an increasing number of participant in the semiconductor industry are also joining voluntary social responsibility initiative such the global compact voluntary initiative for business to develop implement and disclose sustainability policy and practice these social and environmental responsibility provision and initiative are subject to change can be unpredictable and may be difficult and expensive for to comply with given the complexity of our supply chain and our significant outsourced manufacturing if we are unable to comply or are unable to cause our supplier or cm to comply with such policy or provision customer may stop purchasing product from and may take legal action against which could harm our reputation revenue and result of operation in addition part of their corporate social and environmental responsibility program an increasing number of oems are seeking to source product that do not contain mineral sourced from area where proceeds from the sale of such mineral are likely to be used to fund armed conflict such in the democratic republic of congo this could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of mineral used in the manufacture of semiconductor device including our product result we may face difficulty in satisfying these customer demand which may harm our sale and operating result the average selling price of semiconductor product in our market have often decreased rapidly and may do so in the future which could harm our revenue and gross profit the semiconductor product we develop and sell are used for high volume application result the price of those product have often decreased rapidly gross profit on our product may be negatively affected by among other thing pricing pressure from our customer in the past we have reduced the average selling price of our product in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressure new product introduction by or our competitor and other factor in addition some of our customer agreement provide for volume based pricing and product pricing roadmaps which can also reduce the average selling price of our product over time our margin and financial result will suffer if we are unable to offset any reduction in our average selling price by increasing our sale volume reducing manufacturing cost or developing new and higher value added product on timely basis breach of our security system may have material adverse effect on our business our security system are designed to maintain the physical security of our facility and protect our customer supplier and employee confidential information well our own proprietary information however we are also dependent on number of third party cloud based and other service provider of critical corporate infrastructure service relating to among other thing human resource electronic communication service and certain finance function and we are out of necessity dependent on the security system of these provider in addition all software including the security technology produced by have had occasionally in the past and may have in the future vulnerability that if left unmanaged could reduce the overall level of security accidental or willful security breach or other unauthorized access of our facility our information system or the system of our service provider or the existence of computer virus or malware in our or their data or software could expose to risk of information loss and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information including information relating to our product or customer and the personal information of our employee we have from time to time also been subject to or attempt of unauthorized network intrusion and malware on our own it network result of the covid pandemic remote access to our network and system ha increased substantially while we have taken step to secure our network and system we may be more vulnerable to successful cyber attack or information security incident while our workforce work remotely certain of our software product are intended to manage and secure it infrastructure and environment and result we expect these product to be ongoing target of cyber security attack open source code or other third party software used in these product could also be targeted additionally we use third party data center which may also be subject to hacking or accidental incident although we continually seek to improve our countermeasure to prevent such incident we may be unable to anticipate every scenario and it is possible that certain cyber threat or vulnerability will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack or an accidental incident on and our customer cyber security attack could require significant expenditure of our capital and diversion of our resource additionally effort by malicious cyber actor or others could cause interruption delay or cessation of our product licensing or modification of our software which could cause to lose existing or potential customer successful cyber security attack involving our product and it infrastructure could also negatively impact the market perception of their effectiveness and adversely affect our reputation relationship with our customer and our financial result any theft accidental loss or misuse of confidential personally identifiable or proprietary information could disrupt our business and result in among other thing unfavorable publicity damage to our reputation loss of our trade secret and other competitive information difficulty in marketing our product allegation by our customer that we have not performed of contentsour contractual obligation litigation by affected party and possible financial obligation for liability and damage related to the theft or misuse of such information well fine and other sanction resulting from any related breach of data privacy regulation such the general data protection regulation any of which could have material adverse effect on our business profitability and financial condition interruption in our operation and service or disruption to the functionality provided by our software including the operation of our global civilian cyber intelligence threat network could adversely impact our revenue or cause customer to cease doing business with in addition our business would be harmed if any of the event of this nature caused our customer and potential customer to believe our service are unreliable our operation are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity event that could have significant disruptive effect on our operation since the technique used to obtain unauthorized access to system or to otherwise sabotage them change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against target we may be unable to anticipate these technique or to implement adequate preventative measure fluctuation in foreign exchange rate could result in loss we operate global business and our consolidated financial result are reported in dollar however some of the revenue and expense of our foreign subsidiary are denominated in local currency fluctuation in foreign exchange rate against the dollar could result in substantial change in reported revenue and operating result due to the foreign exchange impact of translating these transaction into dollar in the normal course of business we employ various hedging strategy to partially mitigate these risk including the use of derivative instrument these strategy may not be effective in protecting against the effect of fluctuation in foreign exchange rate result fluctuation in foreign exchange rate could result in financial loss risk related to our taxeschanges in tax legislation or policy could materially impact our financial position and result of operation corporate tax reform anti base erosion rule and tax transparency continue to be high priority in many jurisdiction result policy regarding corporate income and other tax in numerous jurisdiction are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation ha been and will likely continue to be proposed or enacted in number of jurisdiction in which we operate after enactment of the tax cut and job act the tax reform act most of our income is taxable in the with significant portion taxable under the global intangible low taxed income gilti regime beginning in fiscal year the deduction allowable under the gilti regime will decrease from to which will increase the effective tax rate imposed on our income further if the tax rate increase or the deduction allowable under the gilti regime is further reduced or eliminated our provision for income tax net income and cash flow would be adversely impacted in addition many country are implementing legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rule with the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd base erosion and profit shifting recommendation and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy including change to cross border tax transfer pricing documentation rule and nexus based tax incentive practice the oecd is also continuing discussion surrounding fundamental change in allocation of profit among tax jurisdiction in which company do business well the implementation of global minimum tax namely the pillar one and pillar two proposal result of this heightened scrutiny prior decision by tax authority regarding treatment and position of corporate income tax could be subject to enforcement activity and legislative investigation and inquiry which could also result in change in tax policy or prior tax ruling any such change may also result in the tax we previously paid being subject to change further many jurisdiction have passed and may pas additional legislation intended to alleviate the economic burden of covid and to fund economic recovery and growth including various temporary tax incentive or relief and restricted tax measure which could result in future tax increase we can not predict the extent to which the covid pandemic will impact our tax liability and are continuing to evaluate the impact of the new legislation to our financial statement any substantial change in domestic or international corporate tax policy regulation or guidance enforcement activity or legislative initiative may materially adversely affect our business the amount of tax we are required to pay and our financial condition and result of operation generally if the tax incentive or tax holiday arrangement we have negotiated change or cease to be in effect or applicable for any reason or if our assumption and interpretation regarding tax law and incentive or holiday arrangement prove to be incorrect our corporate income tax could significantly increase our operation are currently structured to benefit from the various tax incentive extended to in various jurisdiction to encourage investment or employment for example absent our principal tax incentive from the singapore economic development board which is scheduled to expire in the corporate income tax rate that would otherwise apply to our singapore taxable income would be we also have tax holiday on our qualifying income in malaysia which is scheduled of contentsto expire in fiscal year each tax incentive and tax holiday is subject to our compliance with various operating and other condition and may in some instance be amended or terminated prior to their scheduled termination date by the relevant governmental authority if we can not or elect not to comply with the operating condition included in any particular tax incentive or tax holiday we could in some instance be required to refund previously realized material tax benefit or if such tax incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to it expiration absent new incentive applying we will lose the related tax benefit earlier than scheduled in addition we may be required or elect to modify our operational structure and tax strategy in order to keep an incentive which could result in decrease in the benefit of the incentive our tax incentive and tax holiday taking into consideration the effect of the tax reform act and other indirect tax provision increased the benefit from income tax by approximately million in the aggregate and increased diluted net income per share by for fiscal year our interpretation and conclusion regarding the tax incentive are not binding on any taxing authority and if our assumption about tax and other law are incorrect or if these tax incentive are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequence which would increase our expense reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flow our benefit from income tax and overall cash tax cost are affected by number of factor that could materially adversely affect financial result significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide benefit from income tax in the ordinary course of our business there are many transaction where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain additionally our calculation of income tax payable currently and on deferred basis are based on our interpretation of applicable tax law in the jurisdiction in which we are required to file tax return although we believe our tax estimate are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different than what is reflected in our income tax provision and accrual our benefit from income tax is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by numerous factor including reorganization or restructuring of our business tangible and intangible asset outstanding indebtedness and corporate structure jurisdictional mix of our income and asset change in the allocation of income and expense including adjustment related to change in our corporate structure acquisition or tax law change in and foreign tax law and regulation change to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiary taxation of income generated from foreign source the deductibility of expense attributable to income and foreign tax credit rule tax effect of increase in non deductible employee compensation and change in tax accounting rule or principle and in the valuation of deferred tax asset and liability we have adopted transfer pricing policy that call for the provision of service the sale of product the arrangement of financing and the grant of license from one affiliate to another at price that we believe are negotiated on an arm length basis our taxable income is dependent upon acceptance by local authority that our operational practice and intercompany transfer pricing are on an arm length basis due to inconsistency in application of the arm length standard among taxing authority well lack of comprehensive treaty based protection transfer pricing challenge by tax authority could if successful result in adjustment for prior or future year the effect of any such change could subject to higher tax and our earnings result of operation and cash flow would be adversely affected in addition we are subject to and are under tax audit in various jurisdiction and such jurisdiction may ass additional income tax against although we believe our tax position are reasonable the final determination of tax audit could be materially different from our income tax provision and accrual the ultimate result of an audit could have material adverse effect on our result of operation and cash flow in the period or period for which that determination is made the internal revenue service may not agree that prior to our redomiciliation into the our predecessor broadcom limited should have been treated foreign corporation for federal income tax purpose although broadcom limited our predecessor wa singapore entity the internal revenue service irs may assert that following our acquisition of brcm broadcom limited should have been treated corporation for federal income tax purpose pursuant to section of the internal revenue code of amended the code if the irs were to determine that under section of the code the former shareholder of brcm held at least of the vote or of contentsvalue of the ordinary share of broadcom limited immediately after our acquisition of brcm such percentage referred to the section percentage broadcom limited would be treated surrogate foreign corporation and several limitation could then apply to brcm for example brcm would be prohibited from using it net operating loss foreign tax credit or other tax attribute to offset the income or gain recognized by reason of the transfer of property to foreign related person during the year period following our acquisition of brcm or any income received or accrued during such period by reason of license of any property by brcm to foreign related person moreover in such case section of the code and rule related thereto would impose an excise tax on the value of certain stock compensation held directly or indirectly by certain brcm disqualified individual including former officer and director of brcm at rate equal to but only if gain is otherwise recognized by brcm former shareholder result of our acquisition of brcm if the irs were to determine the section percentage wa or more then broadcom limited would be treated corporation for federal income tax purpose while we believe the section percentage wa significantly le than determining the section percentage is complex and is subject to factual and legal uncertainty there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with our position risk related to our indebtednessour substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to execute our business strategy of november the aggregate indebtedness under our senior note and term loan wa million and million respectively we expect to maintain significant level of indebtedness going forward our substantial indebtedness could have important consequence including increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry condition exposing to interest rate risk due to our variable rate term facility which we do not typically hedge against limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to change in the economy and the semiconductor industry placing at competitive disadvantage compared to our competitor with le indebtedness making it more difficult to borrow additional fund in the future to fund growth acquisition working capital capital expenditure and other purpose and potentially requiring to dedicate substantial portion of our cash flow from operation to payment on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund our other business need in addition our variable rate indebtedness use libor benchmark for establishing the effective interest rate libor is being phased out and the consequence of changing to alternative reference rate could increase the cost of our variable rate indebtedness we receive debt rating from the major credit rating agency in the factor that may impact our credit rating include debt level planned asset purchase or sale and near term and long term production growth opportunity liquidity asset quality cost structure reserve mix and commodity pricing level could also be considered by the rating agency while we are focused on maintaining investment grade rating from these agency we may be unable to do so any downgrade in our credit rating or the rating of our indebtedness or adverse

asset in addition the instrument contain customary event of default upon the occurrence of which after any applicable grace period the indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable in such event we may not have sufficient available cash to repay such debt at the time it becomes due or be able to refinance such debt on acceptable term or at all any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation of contentsservicing our debt requires significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt our ability to make scheduled payment of the principal of to pay interest on and to refinance our debt depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factor our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operation in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligation under our current indebtedness and any

looking statement result of various factor including those set forth under the caption risk factor or in other part of this annual report on form overview we are global technology leader that design develops and supply broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solution we develop semiconductor device with focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based device and analog iii based product we have history of innovation in the semiconductor industry and offer thousand of product that are used in end product such enterprise and data center networking home connectivity set top box broadband access telecommunication equipment smartphones and base station data center server and storage system factory automation power generation and alternative energy system and electronic display our infrastructure software solution enable customer to plan develop automate manage and secure application across mainframe distributed mobile and cloud platform we offer cyber security solution portfolio including endpoint network information and identity security solution we also offer mission critical fibre channel storage area networking fc san product and related software in the form of module switch and subsystem incorporating multiple semiconductor product during the first quarter of our fiscal year ended november fiscal year we changed our organizational structure resulting in two reportable segment semiconductor solution and infrastructure software in addition during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year we refined our allocation methodology for certain selling general and administrative expense to more closely align these cost with the segment benefiting from the shared expense prior period segment result have been recast to conform to the current presentation our strategy is to combine best of breed technology leadership in semiconductor and infrastructure software solution with unmatched scale on common sale and administrative platform to deliver comprehensive suite of infrastructure technology product to the world leading business and government customer we seek to achieve this through responsibly financed acquisition of category leading business and technology well investing extensively in research and development to ensure our product retain their technology leadership this strategy result in robust business model designed to drive diversified and sustainable operating and financial result the demand for our product ha been affected in the past and is likely to continue to be affected in the future by various factor including the following gain or loss of significant customer general economic and market condition in the industry and market in which we compete our distributor product inventory and end customer demand the rate at which our present and future customer and end user adopt our product and technology in our target market and the rate at which our customer product that include our technology are accepted in their market the shift to cloud based it solution and service such hyperscale computing which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sale of our product for use in traditional enterprise data center and the timing rescheduling or cancellation of expected customer order our fiscal year and our fiscal year ended november fiscal year were week fiscal year compared to our fiscal year ended november fiscal year which wa week fiscal year covid updatein response to the ongoing covid pandemic and the various resulting government directive we have taken extensive measure to protect the health and safety of our employee and contractor at our facility we modified our workplace practice globally which resulted in most of our employee working remotely for an extended period of time while we have implemented phased in return of employee to many of our facility if the spread of covid worsens significantly we may need to further limit onsite operation or otherwise modify our business practice we continue to monitor the implication of the covid pandemic on our business well our customer and supplier business of contentsthe demand environment for our semiconductor product wa consistent with our expectation for our fourth quarter of fiscal year with continued demand for product and infrastructure to support dramatic increase around the world in remote or tele work and learning due to covid while we continue to see robust demand in this area the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and it may not be sustainable over the longer term to date the impact of covid on the demand environment for our software product ha been limited on the product supply side we continue to experience various constraint in our supply chain due to the pandemic including with respect to wafer and substrate result supply lead time are still extended and we continue to have difficulty in obtaining some necessary component and input in timely manner however the disruption in our outsourced assembly and test capacity that we experienced previously result of covid related shutdown have largely resolved we have also taken various action to de risk our business in light of the ongoing uncertainty for example we are largely building semiconductor product to order instead of based on customer forecast in addition during the fourth fiscal quarter we continued to strengthen our balance sheet including closely managing working capital and reducing our total debt outstanding overall in light of the changing nature and continuing uncertainty around the covid pandemic our ability to predict the impact of covid on our business in future period remains limited the effect of the pandemic on our business are unlikely to be fully realized or reflected in our financial result until future period fiscal year highlightshighlights during fiscal year include the following we acquired the symantec corporation enterprise security business the

also assumed all eligible unvested brocade equity award in the transaction on december we sold certain brocade business for an aggregate of million in cash net revenuea majority of our net revenue is derived from sale of broad range of semiconductor device that are incorporated into electronic product well from module switch and subsystem net revenue is also generated from the sale of software solution that enable our customer to plan develop automate manage and secure application across mainframe distributed mobile and cloud platform our overall net revenue well the percentage of total net revenue generated by sale in our semiconductor solution and infrastructure software segment ha varied from quarter to quarter due largely to fluctuation in end market demand including the effect of seasonality which are discussed in detail in part item business under seasonality of this annual report on form of contentsoriginal equipment manufacturer oems or their contract manufacturer and distributor typically account for the substantial majority of our semiconductor sale to serve customer around the world we have strategically developed relationship with large global electronic component distributor complemented by number of regional distributor with customer relationship based on their respective product range we also sell our product to wide variety of oems or their contract manufacturer we have established strong relationship with leading oem customer across multiple target market our direct sale force focus on supporting our large oem customer and ha specialized product and service knowledge that enables to sell specific offering at key level throughout customer organization certain customer require to contract with them directly and with specified intermediary such contract manufacturer many of our major customer relationship have been in place for many year and are often the result of year of collaborative product development this ha enabled to build our extensive intellectual property ip portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our customer requirement including substantial system level knowledge this collaboration ha provided with key insight into our customer business and ha enabled to be more efficient and productive and to better serve our target market and customer we recognize revenue upon delivery of product to the distributor which can cause our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly such revenue is reduced for estimated return and distributor allowance our traditional software customer generally consist of large enterprise that have computing environment from multiple vendor and are highly complex we believe our enterprise wide license model will continue to offer our customer reduced complexity more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth cost and expensescost of product sold cost of product sold consists primarily of the cost for semiconductor wafer and other material well the cost of assembling and testing those product and material such cost include personnel and overhead related to our manufacturing operation which include stock based compensation expense related occupancy computer service equipment cost manufacturing quality order fulfillment warranty adjustment inventory adjustment including write down for inventory obsolescence and acquisition cost which include direct transaction cost and acquisition related cost although we outsource significant portion of our manufacturing activity we do have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facility if we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facility at desired level the fixed cost associated with these facility will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit cost and lower gross margin cost of subscription and service cost of subscription and service consists of personnel project cost associated with professional service or support of our subscription and service revenue and allocated facility cost and other corporate expense personnel cost include stock based compensation expense total cost of revenue also includes the purchase accounting effect on inventory amortization of acquisition related intangible asset and restructuring charge research and development research and development expense consists primarily of personnel cost for our engineer engaged in the design and development of our product and technology including stock based compensation expense these expense also include project material cost third party fee paid to consultant prototype development expense allocated facility cost and other corporate expense and computer service cost related to supporting computer tool used in the engineering and design process selling general and administrative selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated cost for sale and marketing personnel including stock based compensation expense sale commission paid to our independent sale representative advertising cost trade show corporate marketing promotion travel related to our sale and marketing operation related occupancy and equipment cost and other marketing cost general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated cost for executive management finance human resource and other administrative personnel including stock based compensation expense outside professional fee allocated facility cost acquisition related cost and other corporate expense amortization of acquisition related intangible asset in connection with our acquisition we recognize intangible asset that are being amortized over their estimated useful life we also recognize goodwill which is not amortized and in process research and development ipr which is initially capitalized an indefinite lived intangible asset in connection with the acquisition upon completion of each underlying project ipr asset are reclassified amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized over their estimated useful life restructuring impairment and disposal charge restructuring impairment and disposal charge consist primarily of compensation

discount amortization of debt premium and debt issuance cost and expense related to debt modification or extinguishments other income net other income net includes interest income gain or loss on investment foreign currency remeasurement and other miscellaneous item provision for benefit from income tax we have structured our operation to maximize the benefit from tax incentive extended to in various jurisdiction to encourage investment or employment our tax incentive from the singapore economic development board provide that any qualifying income earned in singapore is subject to tax incentive or reduced rate of singapore income tax subject to our compliance with the condition specified in these incentive and legislative development these singapore tax incentive are presently expected to expire in november the corporate income tax rate in singapore that would otherwise apply to would be we also have tax holiday on our qualifying income in malaysia which is scheduled to expire in fiscal year each tax incentive and tax holiday is also subject to our compliance with various operating and other condition if we can not or elect not to comply with any such operating condition specified we could in some instance be required to refund previously realized material tax benefit or if such tax incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to it expiration absent new incentive applying we will lose the related tax benefit earlier than scheduled we may elect to modify our operational structure and tax strategy which may not be beneficial to the benefit provided under the present tax concession arrangement before taking into consideration the effect of the tax cut and job act tax reform act and other indirect tax impact the effect of these tax incentive and tax holiday wa to increase the benefit from income tax by approximately million million and million for fiscal year and respectively our interpretation and conclusion regarding the tax incentive are not binding on any taxing authority and if our assumption about tax and other law are incorrect or if these tax incentive are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequence which would increase our expense reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flow in addition taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practice and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authority being on an arm length basis due to inconsistency in application of the arm length standard among taxing authority well lack of adequate treaty based protection transfer pricing challenge by tax authority could if successful substantially increase our income tax expense the tax reform act made significant change to the internal revenue code including decrease in the corporate tax rate from to effective for tax year beginning after december the accrual of income tax on foreign earnings when earned allowing certain foreign dividend to then be tax exempt rather than deferring such income tax payment until the foreign earnings are repatriated into the and the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated non earnings of controlled foreign corporation the transition tax following the enactment of the tax reform act the security and exchange commission sec issued guidance for situation when there is insufficient information to complete the accounting for certain income tax effect of the tax reform act based on our interpretation of the tax reform act and the sec guidance we recognized an income tax benefit of million during fiscal year during fiscal year we recorded an income tax provision of million from change in estimate of our fiscal year benefit result of proposed treasury regulation issued in fiscal year related to the tax reform act we also recognized an income tax benefit of million in fiscal year primarily result of our redomiciliation to the united state in april critical accounting estimatesthe preparation of financial statement in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle in the united state gaap requires to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability and disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period we base our estimate and assumption on current fact historical experience and various other factor that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability and the accrual of cost and expense that are not readily apparent from other source our actual financial result may differ materially and adversely from our estimate our critical accounting policy are those that affect our historical financial statement materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgment by management those policy include revenue recognition business combination valuation of long lived asset intangible asset and goodwill inventory valuation income tax retirement and post retirement benefit plan assumption stock based compensation and employee bonus program see note summary of significant accounting policy included in part ii item of this annual report on form for further information on our critical accounting policy and estimate revenue recognition we account for contract with customer when both party have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligation each party right can be identified payment term can be identified the of contentscontract ha commercial substance and it is probable we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to revenue is recognized when or performance obligation are satisfied by transferring control of promised product or service to customer our product and service can be broadly categorized sale of product and subscription and service we recognize product revenue from sale to direct customer and distributor when control transfer to the customer an allowance for distributor credit covering price adjustment is made based on our estimate of historical experience rate well considering economic condition and contractual term to date actual distributor claim activity ha been materially consistent with the provision we have made based on our historical estimate however because of the inherent nature of estimate there is always risk that there could be significant difference between actual amount and our estimate different judgment or estimate could result in variance that might be significant to reported operating result we also record reduction of revenue for rebate in the same period that the related revenue is recorded we accrue of potential rebate at the time of sale we reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amount specific rebate program contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebate are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid thus the reversal of unclaimed rebate may have positive impact on our net revenue and net income in subsequent period our contract may contain more than one of our product and service each of which is separately accounted for distinct performance obligation when available we use directly observable transaction to determine the standalone selling price for performance obligation our estimate of standalone selling price for each performance obligation require judgment that considers multiple factor including but not limited to historical discounting trend for product and service and pricing practice through different sale channel gross margin objective internal cost competitor pricing strategy technology lifecycles and market condition we also estimate the standalone selling price of our material right our estimate of the value of the customer option to purchase or receive additional product or service at discounted price includes estimating the incremental discount the customer would obtain when exercising the option and the likelihood that the option would be exercised certain contract contain right of return that allows the customer to cancel all or portion of the product or service and receive credit we estimate return based on historical return data which is constrained to an amount for which material revenue reversal is not probable we do not recognize revenue for product or service that are expected to be returned business combination accounting for business combination requires management to make significant estimate and assumption especially at the acquisition date for intangible asset contractual obligation assumed restructuring liability pre acquisition contingency and contingent consideration where applicable although we believe the assumption and estimate we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain critical estimate in valuing certain of the intangible asset we have acquired include but are not limited to future expected cash flow from product sale customer contract and acquired technology revenue growth rate customer ramp up period technology obsolescence rate expected cost to develop ipr into commercially viable product estimated cash flow from the project when completed and discount rate the discount rate used to discount expected future cash flow to present value are typically derived from weighted average cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risk unanticipated event and circumstance may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumption estimate or actual result valuation of goodwill and long lived asset we perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year and more frequently if we believe indicator of impairment exist the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment to review for impairment we first ass qualitative factor to determine whether event or circumstance lead to determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting unit is le than it carrying amount our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill whether performed annually or based on specific event or circumstance considers various macroeconomic industry specific and company specific factor these factor include severe adverse industry or economic trend ii significant company specific action including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operation iii current historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance or iv sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value after assessing the totality of event and circumstance if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting unit is le than it carrying amount no further assessment is performed if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting unit is le than it carrying amount we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit net book value determining the fair value of reporting unit involves the use of significant estimate and assumption our goodwill impairment test us both the income approach and the market approach to estimate reporting unit fair value the of contentsincome approach is based on the discounted cash flow method that us the reporting unit estimate for forecasted future financial performance including revenue operating expense and tax well working capital and capital asset requirement these estimate are developed part of our long term planning process based on assumed market segment growth rate and our assumed market segment share estimated cost based on historical data and various internal estimate projected cash flow are then discounted to present value employing discount rate that properly account for the estimated market weighted average cost of capital well any risk unique to the subject cash flow the market approach is based on weighting financial multiple of comparable company and applies control premium reporting unit carrying value represents the assignment of various asset and liability excluding certain corporate asset and liability such cash and debt we ass the impairment of long lived asset including purchased ipr property plant and equipment and intangible asset whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable factor we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating result ii significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business or iii significant negative industry or economic trend the process of evaluating the potential impairment of long lived asset under the accounting guidance on property plant and equipment and other intangible asset is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment in order to estimate the fair value of long lived asset we typically make various assumption about the future prospect of our business or the part of our business that the long lived asset relates to we also consider market factor specific to the business and estimate future cash flow to be generated by the business which requires significant judgment it is based on assumption about market demand for our product over number of future year based on these assumption and estimate we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the long lived asset stated on our consolidated balance sheet to reflect it estimated fair value assumption and estimate about future value and remaining useful life are complex and often subjective they can be affected by variety of factor including external factor such the real estate market industry and economic trend and internal factor such change in our business strategy and our internal forecast although we believe the assumption and estimate we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate change in assumption and estimate could materially impact our reported financial result inventory valuation we regularly review inventory quantity on hand and record provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirement demand for our product can fluctuate significantly from period to period significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantity on hand in addition our industry is characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantity on hand additionally our estimate of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate which may cause to understate or overstate both the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory and cost of product sold therefore although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecast of future product demand any significant unanticipated change in demand or technological development could have significant impact on the value of our inventory and our result of operation income tax significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for or benefit from income tax including the determination of deferred tax asset and liability and any valuation allowance that might be required against the deferred tax asset we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategy in assessing the need for valuation allowance if we determine that valuation allowance is required such adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase our tax expense in the period in which such determination is made conversely if we determine that valuation allowance exceeds our requirement such adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease tax expense in the period in which such determination is made in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing position we accrue an income tax liability when such position do not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition the calculation of our tax liability involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax law and regulation in multitude of jurisdiction we recognize potential liability for anticipated tax audit issue in the and other tax jurisdiction based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax interest and penalty will be due if our estimate of income tax liability prof to be le than the actual amount ultimately assessed further charge to tax expense would be required if the payment of these amount ultimately prof to be unnecessary the reversal of the accrued liability would result in tax benefit being recognized in the period when we determine the liability no longer exist of contentsretirement and post retirement benefit plan assumption retirement and post retirement benefit plan cost represent obligation that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future retirement and post retirement benefit plan cost over the employee average expected future service to based on the term of the plan and investment and funding decision to estimate the impact of these future payment and our decision concerning funding of these obligation we are required to make assumption using actuarial concept within the framework of gaap one assumption is the discount rate used to calculate the estimated cost other assumption include the expected long term return on plan asset expected future salary increase the health care cost trend rate expected future increase to benefit payment expected retirement date employee turnover retiree mortality rate and portfolio composition we evaluate these assumption at least annually for our and non plan we use october the month end closest to our fiscal year end the annual discount rate measurement date to determine the present value of future benefit payment the discount rate are based on the result of matching expected plan benefit payment with cash flow from hypothetical yield curve constructed with high quality corporate bond yield the discount rate for non plan wa based either on published rate for government bond or use of hypothetical yield curve constructed with high quality corporate bond yield depending on the availability of sufficient quantity of quality corporate bond lower discount rate increase present value of the pension liability and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rate decrease present value of the pension liability and subsequent year pension expense the expected rate of return on plan asset is set equal to the discount rate due to the implementation of our fully matched liability driven investment strategy actuarial assumption are based on our best estimate and judgment material change may occur in retirement benefit cost in the future if these assumption differ from actual event or experience we performed sensitivity analysis on the discount rate which is the key assumption in calculating the pension and post retirement benefit obligation each change of basis point in the discount rate assumption would have had an estimated million impact on the benefit obligation of the fiscal year measurement date each change of basis point in the discount rate assumption or expected rate of return assumption would not have material impact on annual net retirement benefit cost for the fiscal year ending october fiscal year stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense consists of expense for restricted stock unit rsus and stock option granted to employee and non employee or assumed from acquisition well expense associated with broadcom employee stock purchase plan espp we recognize compensation expense for time based stock option and espp right based on the estimated grant date fair value method required under the authoritative guidance using the black scholes valuation model certain equity award include both time based and market based condition and are accounted for market based award the fair value of these market based award is estimated on the date of grant using monte carlo simulation model employee bonus program our employee bonus program which are overseen by our compensation committee or our board in the case of our chief executive officer provide for variable compensation based on the attainment of overall corporate annual target and functional performance metric in the first fiscal quarter of the year if management determines that it is probable that the target and metric will be achieved and the amount can be reasonably estimated variable proportional compensation accrual is recognized based on an assumed achievement of the target and metric the bonus payout level can be greater if attainment of metric and target is greater than and portion of the payouts may not occur if minimum floor of performance is not achieved in subsequent quarter we monitor and accrue for variable compensation expense based on our actual progress toward the achievement of the annual target and metric the actual achievement of target metric at the end of the fiscal year which is subject to approval by our compensation committee may result in the actual variable compensation amount being significantly higher or lower than the relevant estimated amount accrued in earlier quarter which would result in corresponding adjustment in the fourth fiscal quarter fiscal year

experience significant customer concentration in future period the loss of or significant decrease in demand from any of our top five end customer could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition from time to time some of our key semiconductor customer place large order or delay order causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly this is particularly true of our wireless product fluctuation may be magnified by the timing of launch and seasonal variation in sale of mobile handset in addition the ongoing covid pandemic and related challenge and uncertainty may also cause our net revenue to fluctuate significantly and adversely affect our result of operation discussed above additionally if export restriction on one of our larger customer continue revenue in future period may continue to be adversely impacted although we recognize revenue for the majority of our product when title and control transfer in penang malaysia we disclose net revenue by country based on the geographic shipment or delivery location specified by distributor oems contract manufacturer channel partner or software customer in each of fiscal year and approximately of our net revenue came from shipment or delivery to china including hong kong compared to approximately for fiscal year however the end customer for either our product or for the

symantec business ca and brocade commencing of their respective acquisition date see note acquisition for additional information certain reclassification have been made to the consolidated statement of cash flow for fiscal year these reclassification have no impact on previously reported operating investing or financing cash flow during the first quarter of fiscal year we changed our organizational structure resulting in two reportable segment semiconductor solution and infrastructure software reclassification have also been made to segment operating income segment result from prior year have been recast to conform to the current presentation see note segment information for additional information these reclassification have no impact on previously reported consolidated operating income the accompanying consolidated financial statement include the account of broadcom and it subsidiary and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted principle in the united state gaap all intercompany balance and transaction have been eliminated in consolidation of summary of significant accounting policy foreign currency remeasurement we operate in dollar functional currency environment such foreign currency asset and liability are remeasured into dollar at current exchange rate except for non monetary item such inventory and property plant and equipment which are remeasured at historical exchange rate the effect of foreign currency remeasurement were not material for any period presented use of estimate the preparation of financial statement in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability and disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period the input into certain of these estimate and assumption include the consideration of the economic impact of the covid pandemic actual result could differ materially from these estimate and such difference could affect the result of operation reported in future period the impact of the covid pandemic continues to develop many of these estimate could require increased judgment and carry higher degree of variability and volatility and may change materially in future period cash and cash equivalent we consider all highly liquid investment security with original or remaining maturity of three month or le at the date of purchase to be cash equivalent we determine the appropriate classification of our cash and cash equivalent at the time of purchase trade account receivable net trade account receivable are recognized at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest account receivable are reduced by an allowance for doubtful account which is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit loss in our existing account receivable we determine the allowance based on customer specific experience and the aging of such receivables among other factor allowance for doubtful account were not material of november or november account receivable are also recognized net of sale return and distributor credit allowance these amount are recognized when it is both probable and estimable that discount will be granted or product will be returned allowance for sale return and distributor credit allowance of november and november were million and million respectively concentration of credit risk and significant customer our cash cash equivalent and account receivable are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk cash and cash equivalent may be redeemable upon demand and are maintained with several financial institution that management belief are of high credit quality and therefore bear minimal credit risk we seek to mitigate our credit risk by spreading such risk across multiple counterparties and monitoring the risk profile of these counterparties our account receivable are derived from revenue earned from customer located both within and outside the we mitigate collection risk from our customer by performing regular credit evaluation of our customer financial condition and require collateral such letter of credit and bank guarantee in certain circumstance concentration of other risk we operate in market that are highly competitive and rapidly changing significant technological change shifting customer need the emergence of competitive product with new capability general economic condition worldwide the ability to safeguard patent and other intellectual property in rapidly evolving market and reliance on assembly and test subcontractor third party wafer fabricator and independent distributor and other factor could affect our financial result inventory we value our inventory at the lower of actual cost or net realizable value of the inventory with cost being determined under the first in first out method we record provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirement the excess and obsolete balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess and obsolete inventory charge and the written down value of the inventory becomes it new cost basis retirement benefit for defined benefit pension plan we consider various factor in determining our respective pension liability and net periodic benefit cost including the number of employee that we expect to receive benefit their salary level and year of service the expected return on plan asset the discount rate the timing of the payment of benefit and other actuarial assumption if the actual result and event of the retirement benefit plan differ from our current assumption the benefit obligation may be over or under valued post retirement benefit plan asset and liability are estimate of benefit that we expect to pay to eligible retiree we consider various factor in determining the value of our post retirement benefit plan asset and liability including the number of employee that we expect to receive benefit and other actuarial assumption the key benefit plan assumption are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan asset the discount rate are based on the result of matching expected plan benefit payment with cash flow from hypothetical yield curve constructed with high quality corporate bond yield the expected rate of return on plan asset is set equal to the discount rate due to the implementation of our fully matched liability driven investment strategy for the non plan we of contentsset assumption specific to each country we have elected to measure defined benefit pension plan and post retirement benefit plan asset and liability of october which is the month end that is closest to our fiscal year end derivative instrument we use derivative financial instrument primarily foreign exchange forward contract to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk our forward contract generally mature within three month we do not use derivative financial instrument for speculative or trading purpose outstanding derivative are recognized either asset or liability at their fair value based on level input defined in the fair value hierarchy the accounting for gain and loss resulting from change in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and it hedging designation for derivative instrument designated fair value hedge the change in fair value are recognized in other income net in the period of change and are offset by the change in fair value of the hedged item for derivative instrument designated cash flow hedge the change in fair value of the effective portion are initially recognized in other comprehensive income loss net of tax in the period of change and are subsequently reclassified and recognized in other income net when either the hedged transaction affect earnings or it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur the change in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the derivative instrument are recognized in other income net in the period of change which have not been material to date for derivative instrument not designated hedge the change in fair value are recognized in other income net in the period of change we did not have any outstanding derivative instrument of november or november property plant and equipment property plant and equipment are stated at cost le accumulated depreciation and amortization addition improvement and major renewal are capitalized and maintenance repair and minor renewal are expensed incurred asset are held in construction in progress until placed in service upon which date we begin to depreciate these asset when asset are retired or disposed of the asset and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from our property plant and equipment balance and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operation building and leasehold improvement are generally depreciated over to year or over the lease period whichever is shorter and machinery and equipment are generally depreciated over three to ten year we use the straight line method of depreciation for all property plant and equipment lease we determine if an arrangement is lease or contains lease at the inception of the arrangement and evaluate whether the lease is an operating lease or finance lease at the commencement date we recognize right of use rou asset and lease liability for operating and finance lease with term greater than month rou asset represent our right to use an asset for the lease term while lease liability represent our obligation to make lease payment operating and finance lease rou asset and liability are recognized based on the present value of lease payment over the lease term at the lease commencement date we use the implicit interest rate or if not readily determinable our incremental borrowing rate of the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payment the incremental borrowing rate is based on our unsecured borrowing rate adjusted for the effect of collateral operating and finance lease rou asset are recognized net of any lease prepayment and incentive lease term may include option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option operating lease expense is recognized on straight line basis over the lease term finance lease expense is recognized based on the effective interest method over the lease term fair value measurement fair value is defined the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date three level hierarchy is applied to prioritize the input to valuation technique used to measure fair value the hierarchy give the highest priority to unadjusted quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable input level measurement the three level of the fair value hierarchy under the guidance for fair value measurement are described below level level input are quoted price unadjusted in active market for identical asset or liability that the reporting entity ha the ability to access at the measurement date our level asset include cash equivalent banker acceptance trading security investment and investment fund we measure trading security investment and investment fund at quoted market price they are traded in active market with sufficient volume and frequency of transaction level level input are input other than quoted price included within level that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly if the asset or liability ha specified contractual term level input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability level level input are unobservable input for the asset or liability in which there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date level asset and liability include investment in equity security without readily determinable fair value goodwill intangible asset and property plant and equipment which are measured at fair value using discounted cash flow approach when they are impaired quantitative information for level asset and liability reviewed at each reporting period includes indicator of significant deterioration in the earnings performance credit of contentsrating asset quality business prospect of the investee and financial indicator of the investee ability to continue going concern business combination we account for business combination under the acquisition method of accounting which requires to recognize separately from goodwill the asset acquired and the liability assumed at their acquisition date fair value while we use our best estimate and assumption to accurately value asset acquired and liability assumed at the acquisition date well contingent consideration where applicable our estimate are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustment to the asset acquired and liability assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the value of asset acquired or liability assumed whichever come first any subsequent adjustment are recognized in our consolidated statement of operation accounting for business combination requires our management to make significant estimate and assumption especially at the acquisition date including our estimate for intangible asset contractual obligation assumed restructuring liability pre acquisition contingency and contingent consideration where applicable although we believe the assumption and estimate we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain critical estimate in valuing certain acquired intangible asset under the income approach include growth in future expected cash flow from product sale customer contract and acquired technology revenue growth rate customer ramp up period technology obsolescence rate expected cost to develop in process research and development ipr into commercially viable product estimated cash flow from the project when completed and discount rate unanticipated event and circumstance may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumption estimate or actual result goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related cost over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible asset of business acquired goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicator arise for impairment to review for impairment we first ass qualitative factor to determine whether event or circumstance lead to determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting unit is le than it carrying amount our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill whether performed annually or based on specific event or circumstance considers various macroeconomic industry specific and company specific factor those factor include severe adverse industry or economic trend ii significant company specific action including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operation iii current historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance or iv sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value after assessing the totality of event and circumstance if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting unit is le than it carrying amount no further assessment is performed if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting unit is le than it carrying amount we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit net book value if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than it net book value there is no impairment otherwise we calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible asset excluding goodwill of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is le than the carrying value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference determining the fair value of reporting unit involves the use of significant estimate and assumption long lived asset purchased finite lived intangible asset are carried at cost le accumulated amortization amortization is recognized over the period during which the intangible asset are expected to contribute to our cash flow purchased ipr project are capitalized at fair value an indefinite lived intangible asset and assessed for impairment thereafter upon completion of each underlying project ipr asset are reclassified amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized over their estimated useful life if an ipr project is abandoned we recognize the carrying value of the related intangible asset in our consolidated statement of operation in the period it is abandoned on quarterly basis we monitor factor and change in circumstance that could indicate carrying amount of long lived asset including purchased intangible asset and property plant and equipment may not be recoverable factor we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating result ii significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business and iii significant negative industry or economic trend an impairment loss must be measured if the sum of the expected future cash flow undiscounted and before interest from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group is le than the net book value of the asset or asset group the amount of the impairment loss will generally be measured the difference between the net book value of the asset or asset group and the estimated fair value warranty we accrue for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time revenue is recognized product warranty cost are estimated based upon our historical experience and specific identification of the product requirement which may fluctuate based on product mix additionally we accrue for warranty cost associated with occasional or unanticipated product quality issue if loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated of contentsrevenue recognition we account for contract with customer when both party have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligation each party right can be identified payment term can be identified the contract ha commercial substance and it is probable we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to revenue is recognized when or performance obligation are satisfied by transferring control of promised product or service to customer nature of product and servicesour product and service can be broadly categorized sale of product and subscription and service the following is description of the principal activity from which we generate revenue product we recognize revenue from sale to direct customer and distributor when control transfer to the customer rebate and incentive offered to distributor which are earned when sale to end customer are completed are estimated at the point of revenue recognition we have elected to exclude from the transaction price any tax collected from customer and to account for shipping and handling activity performed after customer obtains control of the product activity to fulfill the promise to transfer the product subscription and service our subscription and service revenue consists of sale and royalty from software arrangement support service professional service transfer of intellectual property ip and non recurring engineering nre arrangement revenue from software arrangement primarily consists of fee which may be paid either at contract inception or in installment over the contract term that provide customer with right to use the software access general support and maintenance and utilize our professional service our software license have standalone functionality from which customer derive benefit and the customer obtains control of the software when it is delivered or made available for download we believe that for the majority of software arrangement customer derive significant benefit from the ongoing support we provide the majority of our subscription and service arrangement permit our customer to unilaterally terminate or cancel these arrangement at any time at the customer convenience referred to termination for convenience provision without substantive termination penalty and receive pro rata refund of any prepaid fee accordingly we account for arrangement with these termination for convenience provision series of daily contract resulting in ratable revenue recognition of software revenue over the contractual period support service consist primarily of telephone support and the provision of unspecified update and upgrade on when and if available basis support service represent stand ready obligation for which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement professional service consist of implementation consulting customer education and customer training service the obligation to provide professional service is generally satisfied over time with the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefit we satisfy our performance obligation right to our ip are either sold or licensed to customer ip revenue recognition is dependent on the nature and term of each agreement we recognize ip revenue upon delivery of the ip if there are no substantive future obligation to perform under the arrangement sale based or usage based royalty from the license of ip are recognized at the later of the period the sale or usage occur or the satisfaction of the performance obligation to which some or all of the sale based or usage based royalty have been allocated there are two main category of nre contract that we enter into with our customer nre contract in which we develop custom chip and nre contract in which we accelerate our development of new chip upon the customer request the majority of our nre contract revenue meet the over time criterion such revenue is recognized over the development period with the measure of progress using the input method based on cost incurred to total cost cost to cost the service are provided for nre contract that do not meet the over time criterion revenue is recognized at point in time when the nre service are complete material right contract with customer may also include material right that are also performance obligation these include the right to renew or receive product or service at discounted price in the future revenue allocated to material right is recognized when the customer exercise the right or the right expires arrangement with multiple performance obligationsour contract may contain more than one of the product and service listed above each of which is separately accounted for distinct performance obligation of contentsallocation of consideration we allocate total contract consideration to each distinct performance obligation in bundled arrangement on relative standalone selling price basis the standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstance and to similar customer standalone selling price when available we use directly observable transaction to determine the standalone selling price for performance obligation our estimate of standalone selling price for each performance obligation require judgment that considers multiple factor including but not limited to historical discounting trend for product and service and pricing practice through different sale channel gross margin objective internal cost competitor pricing strategy technology lifecycles and market condition we separately determine the standalone selling price by product or service type additionally we segment the standalone selling price for product where the pricing strategy differ and where there are difference in customer and circumstance that warrant segmentation we also estimate the standalone selling price of our material right lastly we estimate the value of the customer option to purchase or receive additional product or service at discounted price by estimating the incremental discount the customer would obtain when exercising the option and the likelihood that the option would be exercised other policy and judgmentscontract modification we may modify contract to offer customer additional product or service each of the additional product and service is generally considered distinct from those product or service transferred to the customer before the modification we evaluate whether the contract price for the additional product and service reflects the standalone selling price adjusted for fact and circumstance applicable to that contract in these case we account for the additional product or service separate contract in other case where the pricing in the modification doe not reflect the standalone selling price adjusted for fact and circumstance applicable to that contract we account for the additional product or service part of the existing contract on prospective basis on cumulative catch up basis or combination of both based on the nature of the modification in instance where the pricing in the modification offer the customer credit for prior arrangement we adjust our variable consideration reserve for return and other concession right of return certain contract contain right of return that allows the customer to cancel all or portion of the product or service and receive credit we estimate return based on historical return data which is constrained to an amount for which material revenue reversal is not probable we do not recognize revenue for product or service that are expected to be returned transition practical expedient elected we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligation for contract with an original expected length of one year or le and ii contract for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for service performed for contract that were modified before the beginning of the earliest reporting period presented we have not retrospectively restated the contract for those modification we have disclosed the aggregate effect of all modification when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligation for purpose of determining the transaction price and allocating the transaction price at transition research and development research and development expense consists primarily of personnel cost for our engineer and third party engaged in the design and development of our product software and technology including salary bonus and stock based compensation expense project material cost service and depreciation such cost are charged to research and development expense they are incurred stock based compensation expense we

liability projected future taxable income tax planning strategy and recent financial operation if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred income tax asset in the future in excess of their net carrying value we adjust the valuation allowance and reduce the provision for income tax or increase the benefit from income tax likewise if we determine that we are not able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset we increase the provision for income tax or decrease the benefit from income tax in the period such determination is made we account for uncertainty in income tax

dilutive effect of unvested rsus in the money stock option and espp right together referred to equity award well convertible preferred stock and lp unit potentially dilutive share whose effect would have been antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share the dilutive effect of equity award is calculated based on the average stock price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method under the treasury stock method the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock option and purchasing share under the espp and the amount of compensation cost for future service that we have not yet recognized are collectively assumed to be used to repurchase share the dilutive effect of convertible preferred stock and lp unit is calculated using the if converted method the if converted method assumes that these security were converted at the beginning of the reporting period to the extent that the effect is dilutive recent accounting guidancein

technology delivery channel and similar economic characteristic semiconductor solution we provide semiconductor solution for managing the movement of data in data center telecom enterprise and embedded networking application we provide broad variety of radio frequency semiconductor device wireless connectivity solution and custom touch controller for mobile application we also provide

each segment and allocates resource to each segment based on net revenue and operating result and doe not evaluate each segment using discrete asset information operating result by segment include item that are directly attributable to each segment and also include shared expense such global operation including manufacturing support logistics and quality control expense associated with selling general and administrative activity facility and information technology expense shared expense are primarily allocated based on revenue and headcount during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year we refined our allocation methodology for certain selling general and administrative expense to more closely align these cost with the segment benefiting from the shared expense prior period segment

fixed minimum or variable price provision and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligation exclude agreement that are cancelable without penalty cancellation for outstanding purchase order for capital expenditure in connection with construction of our new campus is generally allowed but requires payment of all cost incurred through the date of cancellation and therefore cancelable purchase order for these capital expenditure are included in the table above other contractual commitment represents amount payable pursuant to agreement related to it human resource and other service agreement due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflow associated with our unrecognized tax benefit at november we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of

may require the expenditure of significant of contentsfunds and other resource and the outcome of such proceeding is inherently uncertain with material adverse outcome possible ip property claim

broadcom on august the central district court issued it judgment awarding caltech past damage in the amount awarded by the jury well pre and post judgment interest additionally the central district court awarded caltech an unspecified amount of ongoing royalty to be determined after the anticipated appeal process is resolved neither the jury nor the central district court found willful infringement which if it had could have resulted in enhanced damage up to three time the amount awarded broadcom and apple have appealed to the united state court of appeal for the federal circuit we believe that the evidence and the law do not support the central district court finding of infringement or the award of damage including ongoing royalty and do not believe material loss is probable at this time we believe that there are strong ground for appeal and we intend to vigorously challenge the central district court judgment and ruling result we have not recorded reserve with respect to this litigation in accordance with the applicable accounting standard we believe the low end of the possible range of loss is zero but we can not reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome number of
