in other jurisdiction may continue to consider imposing regulatory requirement on our voice service long the regulatory classification of voip remains unsettled at the federal level voice

universal service mechanism to support broadband capable network and substantially ha revised the program that provides universal service support for service to school and library to begin phasing out

distribution platform are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and influencing consumer behavior which is discussed in the risk factor immediately below under the heading change in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platform for viewing content could adversely affect our business and challenge existing business model comcast annual report on form table of contentscompetition for cable communication cable service consists primarily of phone company with fiber based network and db provider that typically offer feature pricing and packaging for service comparable to ours some of these competitor are also offering smaller package of channel at price point lower than our standard package both through traditional and online video distribution platform which could cause to offer more customized programming package that may be le profitable consolidation between phone company which are also wireless distributor and content provider in the united state provides competitor with the ability to offer free or lower cost streaming service for viewing their content potentially on an exclusive basis through unlimited data usage plan for their internet or wireless phone service additional company some with significant financial resource continue to enter or are seeking to enter the video distribution market either by offering ott streaming service or selling device that aggregate viewing of various ott service sky face competition in video high speed internet and voice service from cable and or telecommunication provider in each of it european market more provider in europe offer customer bundle of service which ha increased competition the intensity of this competition ha increased in recent year including result of ott streaming service cable communication and sky high speed internet service compete primarily against phone company with fiber based network offering speed and pricing comparable to ours wireless internet service such and wireless broadband service satellite delivered internet service and wi fi network and device such smartphones tablet wireless data card and mobile wireless router that connect to such device also may compete with our high speed internet service particularly wireless technology evolves some municipality in the united state own and operate their own broadband network and additional municipality may do so well cable communication and sky wireline voice service are facing increased competition customer replace wireline phone with wireless and internet based phone service we continue to seek way to enhance the value of cable communication cable service network such by growing high speed internet service and business service and by launching additional service such our security and automation service sky also is seeking way to enhance the value of it service there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiative in manner sufficient to grow or maintain our cable communication or sky segment revenue maintain cable communication or sky segment operating margin or to compete successfully in the future each of nbcuniversal business and sky also face substantial and increasing competition from provider of similar type of content well from other form of entertainment and recreational activity nbcuniversal and sky must compete to obtain talent content and other resource required in operating these business the ability of all of our business to compete effectively depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituency including our customer consumer advertiser investor and government authority our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customer with satisfactory customer experience there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or newer competitor or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our business for more detailed description of the competition facing our business see item business and refer to the competition discussion within that section change in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platform for viewing content could adversely affect our business and challenge existing business model distribution platform for viewing and purchasing content over the internet have been and will likely continue to be developed that further increase the number of competitor that all our business face and challenge existing business model these distribution platform are driving change in consumer behavior consumer seek more control over when where and how they consume content and access communication service and how much they pay for such content consumer are increasingly turning to online source for viewing and purchasing content which ha and likely will continue to reduce the number of cable communication video customer and subscriber to nbcuniversal cable network even it make cable communication high speed internet service more important to consumer while these change are primarily affecting our business today there can be no assurance that they will not also affect sky business to similar extent in the future even with sky offering standalone ott video streaming service although we have attempted to adapt our video service offering to changing consumer behavior for example by deploying the platform and adding apps such netflix and amazon prime video on set top box virtual multichannel video provider online video distributor and programming network providing their content directly to consumer over the internet rather than through traditional video distribution service continue to emerge gain consumer acceptance and disrupt traditional video distribution service many of these service offering charge no fee or lower fee than traditional video package for access to their content which could have an adverse effect on demand for cable communication and sky video service including for expanded video package premium network and dvr and on demand service annual report on form ktable of contentsan increasing number of company offering ott streaming service including some with exclusive high quality original video programming well programming network offering content directly to consumer over the internet have increased the number of entertainment choice available to consumer which ha intensified audience fragmentation the increase in entertainment choice adversely affect the audience rating of nbcuniversal cable network and broadcast television programming and sky owned television channel time shifting technology such video on demand service and dvr and cloud based recording service also reduce the viewing of content through traditional and virtual multichannel video provider which ha caused and likely will continue to cause audience rating decline for nbcuniversal cable network and broadcast television programming and sky owned television channel and may adversely affect the price and amount of advertising that advertiser are willing to purchase from and the amount nbcuniversal and sky receive for distribution of their content the success of any of these ongoing or future development or our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitor or change in consumer behavior including among younger consumer could have an adverse effect on our competitive position business and result of operation decline in advertiser expenditure or change in advertising market could negatively impact our business our cable communication cable network broadcast television and sky business compete for the sale of advertising time with other television network and station well with all other advertising platform such digital medium radio and print we derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising and decline in expenditure by advertiser including through traditional linear television distribution model could negatively impact our result of operation decline can be caused by the economic prospect of specific advertiser or industry increased competition for the leisure time of viewer such from social medium and video game and audience fragmentation increased viewing of ad free content through online video distribution platform regulatory intervention regarding where advertising may be placed or the economy in general in addition advertiser willingness to purchase advertising from may be adversely affected by lower audience rating which many of nbcuniversal network and sky television channel have experienced and likely will continue to experience advertising sale and rate also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodology do not accurately reflect actual viewership level for example certain method of viewing content such viewing content through many online video distribution platform or delayed viewing on dvrs might not be counted in audience measurement or may generate le if any revenue than traditional linear television distribution method which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue our business depend on keeping pace with technological development our success is to large extent dependent on our ability to acquire develop adopt and leverage new and existing technology and our competitor use of certain type of technology and equipment may provide them with competitive advantage for example current and new wireless internet technology such and wireless broadband service continue to evolve rapidly to allow for greater speed and reliability and some company and municipality are building advanced fiber based network that provide very fast internet access speed we expect other advance in communication technology to occur in the future if we choose technology or equipment that is not effective or attractive to consumer that employed by our competitor if we fail to employ technology desired by consumer before our competitor do so or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiative our business and result of operation could be adversely affected we also will continue to incur additional cost we execute our technology initiative such the deployment of docsis and docsis fdx our and sky set top box cloud dvr and wireless gateway there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiative in manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to compete successfully in the future we also may generate le revenue or incur increased cost if change in our competitor product offering require that we offer certain of our existing service or enhancement at lower or no cost to our customer or that we increase our research and development expenditure we are subject to regulation by federal state local and foreign authority which impose additional cost and restriction on our business in the united state federal state and local government extensively regulate the high speed internet video and voice service industry our broadcast television business is also highly regulated by law and regulation nbcuniversal cable network filmed entertainment and theme park business are also subject to various other law and regulation at the international federal state and local level sky business is subject to various telecommunication and medium specific regulation in most of the country where it operates the fcc and certain state attorney general and foreign governmental authority also have been active in conducting inquiry and review regarding our service and this trend likely will continue failure to comply with the law and regulation applicable to our business could result in administrative enforcement action fine and civil and criminal liability legislator and regulator at all level of government including foreign authority frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statute rule or regulation or interpretation of existing statue rule or regulation or prescribe new one any of which may significantly affect our business these legislator and regulator have been active in considering rulemakings and legislation regarding our service for example some state have passed or introduced legislation or executive order that comcast annual report on form table of contentsimpose various open internet and data privacy requirement such attempt by the state to regulate portion of our business have the potential to create patchwork of differing and or conflicting state regulation these requirement and any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative action may increase our cost or impose additional restriction on our business some of which may be significant the congress may consider proposal to address communication issue including whether it should rewrite the entire communication act to account for change in the communication marketplace whether it should enact new permanent open internet requirement and whether it should fund new broadband infrastructure we are unable to predict the outcome or effect of any of these potential action or any other legislative or regulatory proposal on our business any change to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our service or business could have an adverse impact on our business and result of operation for more extensive discussion of the significant risk associated with the regulation of our business see item business and refer to the legislation and regulation discussion within that section programming expense for our video service are increasing which could adversely affect cable communication and sky video business we expect programming expense for our video service to continue to be the largest single expense item for our cable communication and sky segment and to increase for the foreseeable future our programming expense may also increase we add programming to our video service or distribute existing programming to more of our customer or through additional delivery platform such on demand or streaming service additionally cable communication pay certain local broadcast television station in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video service customer we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demand for payment and other concession from local broadcast television station these market factor may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the medium industry which may further increase our programming expense if we are unable to raise our customer rate or offset programming cost increase through the sale of additional service or cost management initiative the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our cable communication and sky segment result of operation moreover our contract with content provider expire there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable term if renewed at all in which case we may be unable to provide such content part of cable communication or sky video service and our business and result of operation could be adversely affected nbcuniversal and sky success depends on consumer acceptance of their content and their business may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the cost to create or acquire content increase most of nbcuniversal well sky business create and acquire medium and entertainment content the success of which depends substantially on consumer taste and preference that change in often unpredictable way the success of these business depends on our ability to consistently create acquire market and distribute nbcuniversal cable network and broadcast television programming sky owned television channel filmed entertainment theme park attraction and other content that meet the changing preference of the broad domestic and international consumer market we have invested and will continue to invest substantial amount in our content including in the production of original content on nbcuniversal cable network and broadcast television network and sky owned television channel in our film and for theme park attraction before learning the extent to which it will earn consumer acceptance nbcuniversal and sky also obtain significant portion of their content from third party such movie studio television production company sport organization and other supplier including in the case of sky sometimes on an exclusive basis competition for popular content particularly for sport programming is intense and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitor for popular content entering into or renewing contract for such programming right or acquiring additional right may result in significantly increased cost particularly with respect to long term contract for sport programming right for nbcuniversal and sky our result of operation and cash flow over the term of contract depend on number of factor including the strength of the advertising market audience size the ability to secure distribution from and impose surcharge or obtain carriage on multichannel video provider for nbcuniversal content and the timing and amount of right payment there can be no assurance that revenue from these contract will exceed our cost for the right well the other cost of producing and distributing the programming if our content doe not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if we can not obtain or retain right to popular content on acceptable term or at all nbcuniversal and sky business may be adversely affected annual report on form ktable of contentsthe loss of nbcuniversal programming distribution agreement or the renewal of these agreement on le favorable term could adversely affect our business nbcuniversal cable network

entertainment business are entering into agreement to license their prior season and library content on other distribution platform including subscription video on demand service if nbcuniversal programming doe not attract sufficient viewer traditional and virtual multichannel video provider may decide not to distribute nbcuniversal broadcast and cable network and ott video streaming service may not license programming we create in addition the number of subscriber to nbcuniversal cable network ha been and may continue to be reduced result of multichannel video provider offering smaller package of channel part of their virtual or traditional television programming package and by overall reduced viewing of television programming through multichannel video provider nbcuniversal broadcast television network depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreement with third party local broadcast television station in the market where it doe not own the affiliated local broadcast television station in addition every three year each of it owned local broadcast television station must elect with respect to it retransmission by multichannel video provider within it dma either must carry status in which the distributor carriage of the station is mandatory and doe not generate any compensation for the local station or retransmission consent in which the station give up it right to mandatory carriage and instead seek to negotiate the term and condition of carriage with the distributor including the amount of compensation if any paid to the station by such distributor for the current three year period which commenced on january all of our owned nbc broadcast television station and our owned telemundo broadcast television station elected retransmission consent however certain illegal online entity may stream our broadcast television content online without our consent and without paying any compensation to there can be no assurance that any of our distribution agreement will be renewed in the future on acceptable term or at all the loss of any of these agreement or the renewal of these agreement on le favorable term could reduce

country in which it operates the loss of sky wholesale distribution agreement with traditional multichannel video provider could adversely affect sky business sky benefit from it ability to secure and maintain wholesale distribution agreement for it television channel with traditional multichannel video provider there can be no assurance that any of it distribution agreement will be renewed in the

the updated accounting guidance related to revenue recognition critical accounting judgment and estimate the preparation of our consolidated financial statement requires to make estimate that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and the related disclosure of contingent asset and contingent liability we base our judgment on our historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making estimate about the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily apparent from other source actual result may differ from these estimate under different assumption or condition we believe our judgment and related estimate associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise right and the accounting for film and television cost are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement result of the sky transaction one additional area ha been identified critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement the one additional critical accounting judgment and estimate is the valuation of acquisition related asset and liability management ha discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgment and estimate with the audit committee of our board of director and the audit committee ha reviewed our disclosure relating to them which are presented below see note and to comcast consolidated financial statement for discussion of our accounting policy with respect to these item comcast annual report on form table of contentsvaluation and impairment testing of cable franchise rightsour cable franchise right asset result from agreement we have with state and local government that allow to construct and operate cable business within specified geographic area the value of franchise is derived from the economic benefit we receive from the right to solicit new customer and to market additional service in particular service area the amount we record for cable franchise right are primarily result of cable system acquisition typically when we acquire cable system the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise right often these cable system acquisition include multiple franchise area we currently serve approximately franchise area in the united state we have concluded that our cable franchise right have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factor which limit the period over which these right will contribute to our cash flow accordingly we do not amortize our cable franchise right but we ass their carrying value annually or more frequently whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the fair value impairment testing for the purpose of our impairment testing we have grouped the recorded value of our various cable franchise right into our three cable communication division or unit of account we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level the annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangible asset allows for the option to first ass qualitative factor to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is le than it carrying amount an entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment or an entity may bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test if it is determined on the basis of qualitative factor that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is more likely than not le than it carrying value the quantitative impairment test is required when performing quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise right primarily based on discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment when analyzing the fair value indicated under the discounted cash flow model we also consider multiple of adjusted ebitda generated by the underlying asset current market transaction and profitability information in we performed quantitative assessment of our cable franchise right based on this assessment the estimated fair value of our franchise right exceeded the carrying value of the northeast central and west division by and respectively since the adoption of the accounting guidance related to goodwill and intangible asset in we have not recorded any significant impairment charge to cable franchise right we could record impairment charge in the future if there are change in long term market condition in expected future operating result or in federal or state regulation that prevent from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise right assumption made about increased competition and economic condition could also impact the result of any qualitative assessment and the valuation used in future annual quantitative impairment testing and result in reduction in the fair value of our cable franchise right in addition future change in the unit of account could result in the recognition of an impairment charge film and television costswe capitalize film and television production cost including direct cost production overhead print cost development cost and interest we amortize capitalized film and television production cost including acquired library and accrue cost associated with participation and residual payment to programming and production expense we generally record the amortization and the accrued cost using the individual film forecast computation method which amortizes the cost using the ratio of the current period revenue to estimated total remaining revenue from all source ultimate revenue estimate of ultimate revenue have significant impact on how quickly capitalized cost are amortized and therefore are updated regularly our estimate of ultimate revenue for film generally include revenue from all source that are expected to be earned within year from the date of film initial release these estimate are based on the historical performance of similar content well factor unique to the content itself the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for film intended for theatrical release is the film theatrical performance subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of film ha historically exhibited high correlation to it theatrical performance upon film release our estimate of revenue from succeeding market including from content licensing across multiple platform and home entertainment sale are revised based on historical relationship and an analysis of current market trend with respect to television series or other owned television programming the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond it initial license initial estimate of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode under the initial license once it is determined that television series or other owned television programming can be licensed for subsequent platform revenue estimate for these platform such and international syndication home entertainment and other distribution platform are included in ultimate revenue revenue estimate for produced episode include revenue expected to be earned within year of delivery of the initial episode or if still in production annual report on form ktable of year from the delivery of the most recent episode if later we capitalize the cost of programming content that we license but do not own including right to multiyear live event sport programming at the earlier of when payment are made for the programming or when the license period begin and the content is made available for use we amortize capitalized programming cost the associated program are broadcast we generally amortize multiyear live event sport programming right using the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or under the term of the contract capitalized film and television cost are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering event are identified if the fair value of production were to fall below it unamortized cost we would record an adjustment for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized cost exceed the production fair value the fair value assessment is generally based on estimated future discounted cash flow which are supported by our internal forecast adjustment to capitalized film production cost were not material in any of the period presented fair value of acquisition related asset and liabilitieswe allocate the purchase price of acquired company to tangible and intangible asset and liability based on their estimated fair value in determining fair value management is required to make estimate and assumption that affect the recorded amount management estimate of fair value are based on assumption believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain part of the estimation process third party valuation specialist are engaged to assist in the valuation of certain of these asset and liability our judgment used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of acquired asset and liability well asset life and depreciation and amortization method have material impact on our consolidated financial statement for instance the determination of asset life impact our result of operation different type of asset have different useful life and certain asset may be considered to have indefinite useful life due to the timing of the sky acquisition the allocation of purchase price is based on preliminary estimate and is subject to change below is summary of the methodology and significant assumption used in estimating the fair value of certain of sky asset and liability for which preliminary estimate were determined other asset such property and equipment have been recorded based on historical cost no better estimate

were valued using multiperiod cash flow model form of the income approach this measure of fair value requires considerable judgment about future event including attrition contract renewal estimate and technology change in determining the estimated life and method of amortization for finite lived intangible we use method and life that closely follows the undiscounted cash flow over the estimated life of the asset trade name were valued using the relief from royalty method form of the income approach this measure of fair value requires considerable judgment about the value market participant
