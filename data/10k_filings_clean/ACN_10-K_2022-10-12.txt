carefully consider the following factor which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition result of operation including revenue and profitability and or stock price our business is also subject to general risk and uncertainty that may broadly affect company including additional risk and uncertainty not currently known to or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business financial condition result of operation and or stock price risk in this section are grouped in the following category business risk financial risk operational risk and legal and regulatory risk many risk affect more than one category and the risk are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by category business risksour result of operation have been and may in the future be adversely affected by volatile negative or uncertain economic and political condition and the effect of these condition on our client business and level of business activity global macroeconomic and geopolitical condition affect our client business and the market they serve volatile negative and uncertain economic and political condition have in the past undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant market and other market which are increasingly interdependent causing our client to reduce or defer their spending on new initiative and technology and resulting in client reducing delaying or eliminating spending under existing contract with which negatively affect our business growth in the market we serve could be at slow rate or could stagnate or contract in each case for an extended period of time because we operate globally and have significant business in many market an economic slowdown in any of those market could adversely affect our result of operation ongoing economic and political volatility and uncertainty and changing demand pattern affect our business in number of other way including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plan particularly in consulting economic and political volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effect and change in demand pattern resulting from these and other factor to manifest themselves in our business and result of operation changing demand pattern from economic and political volatility and uncertainty including result of increasing geopolitical tension inflation economic downturn change in global trade policy global health emergency and their impact on our client and the industry we serve could have significant negative impact on our result of operation our business depends on generating and maintaining client demand for our service and solution including through the adaptation and expansion of our service and solution in response to ongoing change in technology and offering and significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our result of operation our financial result depend in part on the demand for our service and solution which could be negatively affected by numerous factor many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product described volatile negative or uncertain global economic and political condition and lower growth or contraction in the market we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our service and solution our success depends in part on our ability to continue to develop and implement service and solution that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing change in technology and offering to serve the evolving need of our client example of area of significant change include digital cloud and security related offering which are continually evolving well development in area such artificial intelligence augmented and virtual reality automation blockchain internet of thing quantum and edge computing infrastructure and network engineering intelligent connected product digital engineering and manufacturing and robotics solution we expand our service and solution into these new area we may be exposed to operational legal regulatory ethical technological and other risk specific to such new area which may negatively affect our reputation and demand for our service and solution table of contentsaccenture form kitem risk factor development may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our client and in the case of cloud and service solution could affect the nature of how we generate revenue some of these technological development have reduced and replaced some of our historical service and solution and may continue to do so in the future this ha caused and may in the future cause client to delay spending under existing contract and engagement and to delay entering into new contract while they evaluate new technology such technological development and spending delay can negatively impact our result of operation if we are unable to introduce new pricing or commercial model that reflect the value of these technological development or if the pace and level of spending on new technology are not sufficient to make up any shortfall development in the industry we serve which may be rapid also could shift demand to new service and solution if result of new technology or change in the industry we serve our client demand new service and solution we may be le competitive in these new area or need to make significant investment to meet that demand our growth strategy focus on responding to these type of development by driving innovation that will enable to expand our business into new growth area if we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry development or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale or if we do not make the right strategic investment to respond to these development and successfully drive innovation our service and solution our result of operation and our ability to develop and maintain competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be adversely affected in particular geographic market service or industry group small number of client have contributed or may in the future contribute significant portion of the revenue of such geographic market service or industry group and any decision by such client to delay reduce or eliminate spending on our service and solution could have disproportionate impact on the result of operation in the relevant geographic market service or industry group many of our consulting contract are le than month in duration and these contract typically permit client to terminate the agreement with little day notice longer term larger and more complex contract such the majority of our outsourcing contract generally require longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our cost or make up for anticipated ongoing revenue and profit lost upon termination of the contract many of our contract allow client to terminate delay reduce or eliminate spending on the service and solution we provide additionally client could choose not to retain for additional stage of project try to renegotiate the term of it contract or cancel or delay additional planned work when contract are terminated or not renewed we lose the anticipated revenue and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenue lost consequently our result of operation in subsequent period could be materially lower than expected the specific business or financial condition of client change in management and change in client strategy are also all factor that can result in termination cancellation or delay if we are unable to match people and their skill with client demand around the world and attract and retain professional with strong leadership skill our business the utilization rate of our professional and our result of operation may be materially adversely affected our success is dependent in large part on our ability to keep our people with market leading skill and capability in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain people with the knowledge and skill to lead our business globally we must hire or reskill retain and inspire appropriate number of talented people with diverse skill in order to serve client across the globe respond quickly to rapid and ongoing change in demand technology industry and the macroeconomic environment and continuously innovate to grow our business for example if we are unable to hire or retrain our employee to keep pace with the rapid and continuous change in technology and the industry we serve we may not be able to innovate and deliver new service and solution to fulfill client demand is competition for scarce talent with market leading skill and capability in new technology and our people have been directly targeted because of their highly sought after skill and this will likely continue there is risk that at certain point in time we may have more people than we need in certain skill set or geography or at compensation level that are not aligned with skill set in these situation we have engaged and may in the future engage in action to rebalance our workforce including reducing the rate of new hire and increasing involuntary termination mean to keep our supply of people and skill in balance with client demand at certain time and in certain geographical region we will find it difficult to hire and retain sufficient number of employee with the skill or background to meet current and or future demand in these case we might need to redeploy existing people or increase our reliance on subcontractor to fill certain labor need if we are not successful in these initiative our result of operation could be adversely affected if our utilization rate is high or too low it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition the quality of the work performed well our ability to staff project we are particularly dependent on retaining member of accenture leadership with critical capability if we are unable to do so our ability to innovate generate new business opportunity and effectively lead large and complex transformation and client relationship could be jeopardized we depend on identifying developing and retaining top talent to innovate and lead table of contentsaccenture form kitem risk factor business this includes developing talent and leadership capability in market where the depth of skilled employee may be limited our ability to expand in our key market depends in large part on our ability to attract develop retain and integrate both leader for the local business and people with critical capability our equity based incentive compensation plan are designed to reward high performing individual for their contribution and provide incentive for them to remain with if the anticipated value of such incentive doe not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or if our total compensation package is not viewed being competitive our ability to attract and retain the people we need could be adversely affected in addition if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity award under our share plan in the amount we believe are necessary our ability to attract and retain people could be negatively affected we face legal reputational and financial risk from any failure to protect client and or accenture data from security incident or cyberattacks we are dependent on information technology network and system to securely process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our location around the world and with our people client ecosystem partner and vendor the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow including result of the increasing reliance on and use of mobile technology social medium and cloud based service and more of our employee continue to work remotely

team together to create competing offering even if we have potential offering that address marketplace or client need competitor may be more successful at selling similar service they offer including to company that are our client some competitor are more established in certain market and may make executing our growth strategy to expand in these market more challenging additionally competitor may also offer more aggressive pricing or contractual term which may affect our ability to win work our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully and expand in the market we currently serve if we are unable to compete successfully we could lose market share and client to competitor which could materially adversely affect our result of operation in addition we may face greater competition due to consolidation of company in the technology sector through strategic merger acquisition or teaming arrangement consolidation activity may result in new competitor with greater scale broader footprint or offering that are more attractive than new service or technology offered by competitor ecosystem partner or new entrant may make our offering le differentiated or le competitive when compared to other alternative which may adversely affect our result of operation the technology company described above including many of our ecosystem partner are increasingly able to offer service related to their software platform cloud migration and other solution or are developing software platform cloud migration and other solution that require integration service to lesser extent or replace them in their entirety these more integrated service and solution may represent more attractive alternative to client than some of our service and solution which may materially adversely affect our competitive position and our result of operation our ability to attract and retain business and employee may depend on our reputation in the marketplace we believe the accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate asset that help distinguish our service and solution from those of competitor and also contribute to our effort to recruit and retain talented employee however our corporate reputation is susceptible to material damage by event such dispute with client or competitor cybersecurity incident or service outage internal control

complexity of performing our work or if third party upon we rely do not meet their commitment then our contract could have delivery inefficiency and be le profitable than expected or unprofitable our

affected by challenge to our intercompany transaction change in the valuation of deferred tax asset and liability change in tax law or in their interpretation or enforcement change in the mix of earnings in country with differing statutory tax rate and change in accounting principle including the generally accepted accounting principle tax rate and policy in the jurisdiction in which we operate may change materially result of shifting economic social and political condition in addition change in tax law treaty or regulation or their interpretation or enforcement have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent which could materially adversely affect our tax position number of country where we do business including the united state and many country in the european union have implemented and are considering implementing change in relevant tax accounting and other law regulation and interpretation the overall tax environment remains highly uncertain and increasingly complex the european commission ha been conducting investigation focusing on whether local country tax ruling or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rule country around the world are also considering change in their tax law and regulation in the various proposal to raise corporate income tax are periodically considered individual country across the globe and the european union have either enacted or plan to enact digital tax to impose incremental tax on company based on where ultimate user are located the organization for economic co operation and development oecd global coalition of member country proposed two pillar plan to reform international taxation the oecd proposal aim to prevent the proliferation of separate new digital tax and to ensure fairer distribution of profit among country by creating new global system to tax income based on the location of user and to impose floor on tax competition through the introduction of global minimum tax there remains significant uncertainty around whether the various proposal will ultimately be enacted and if enacted the extent of their impact the increased focus of the european commission and various jurisdiction on investigation and enacting new tax law could have material adverse effect on our effective tax rate result of operation cash flow and financial condition although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the united state and ireland legislative or diplomatic action could be taken or the treaty may be amended in such way that would prevent from being able to rely on such treaty our inability to rely on the treaty would subject to increased taxation or significant additional expense in addition we could be materially adversely affected by change in the law or in their interpretation or enforcement around the definition of person for federal income tax purpose and by change in tax law or policy or in their interpretation or enforcement in ireland or other jurisdiction where we operate including their treaty with ireland or the united state table of contentsaccenture form kitem risk factor result of operation could be materially adversely affected by fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate although we report our result of operation in dollar majority of our revenue is denominated in currency other than the dollar unfavorable fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate have had an adverse effect and could in the future have material adverse effect on our result of operation because our consolidated financial statement are presented in dollar we must translate revenue expense and income well asset and liability into dollar at exchange rate in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore change in the value of the dollar against other currency will affect our revenue operating income and the value of balance sheet item including intercompany payable and receivables originally denominated in other currency these change cause our growth stated in dollar to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other period our currency hedging program which are designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the change in value of certain balance sheet item might not be successful additionally some transaction and balance may be denominated in currency for which there is no available market to hedge we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of our expense are incurred in currency other than those in which we bill for the related service an increase in the value of certain currency such the indian rupee or philippine peso against the currency in which our revenue is recorded could increase cost for delivery of service at off shore site by increasing labor and other cost that are denominated in local currency our contractual provision or cost management effort might not be able to offset their impact and our currency hedging activity which are designed to partially offset this impact might not be successful this could result in decrease in the profitability of our contract that are utilizing delivery center resource in addition our currency hedging activity are themselves subject to risk these include risk related to counterparty performance under hedging contract risk related to ineffective hedge and risk related to currency fluctuation we also face risk that extreme economic condition political instability or hostility or disaster of the type described below could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying exposure that we are hedging such an event could lead to loss being recognized on the currency hedge then in place that are not offset by anticipated change in the underlying hedged exposure change to accounting standard or in the estimate and assumption we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statement could adversely affect our financial result our financial statement have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle it is possible that change in accounting standard could have material adverse effect on our result of operation and financial position the application of generally accepted accounting principle requires to make estimate and assumption about certain item and future event that affect our reported financial condition and our accompanying disclosure with respect to among other thing revenue recognition and income tax our most critical accounting estimate are described in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation under critical accounting policy and estimate we base our estimate on historical experience contractual commitment and various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance and at the time they are made these estimate and assumption involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty some of which are beyond our control if our estimate or the assumption underlying such estimate are not correct actual result may differ materially from our estimate and we may need to among other thing adjust revenue or accrue additional cost that could adversely affect our result of operation operational risksas result of our geographically diverse operation and our strategy to continue to grow in our key market around the world we are more susceptible to certain risk we have office and operation in more than city in country around the world one aspect of our strategy is to continue to grow in our key market around the world our strategy might not be successful if we are unable to manage the risk of our global operation and strategy

other accenture location and people and any time in important process we operate for client could result in material adverse effect on our result of operation and our reputation in the marketplace moreover the extent to which covid will continue to impact our business operation and financial result will depend on numerous evolving factor that are difficult to accurately predict including the emergence and virulence of new variant the availability and effectiveness of vaccine and treatment for covid globally government business and individual action in response to the pandemic and the effect on the macroeconomic environment and on our client and their supply chain our business model is dependent on our global delivery capability while our delivery center are located throughout the

occur where large number of our people are located or simultaneously affect our people in multiple location around the world we generally do not have insurance for loss and interruption caused by terrorist attack conflict and war if these disruption prevent from effectively serving our client our result of operation could be significantly adversely affected if we are unable to manage the

regulatory reputational or other risk specific to these area including risk related to data security failure of client system based on our service or solution could also subject to claim for significant damage that could materially adversely affect our result of operation in order to remain competitive we increasingly enter into agreement based on our client contract term after conducting an assessment of the risk of doing so which may expose to additional risk in addition the contracting practice of competitor along with the demand of increasingly sophisticated client may cause contract term and condition that are unfavorable to to become new standard in the industry we may commit to providing service or solution that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery may reduce our

could result in liability for significant monetary damage fine enforcement action and or criminal prosecution or sanction unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage and restriction on our

terminated or work being transferred onshore resulting in greater cost to and could have negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government client in addition several jurisdiction where we operate have proposed legislation regulating artificial intelligence and non personal data that may impose significant requirement on how we design build and deploy artificial intelligence and handle non personal data for ourselves and our client our work with government client expose to additional risk inherent in the government contracting environment our client include national provincial state and local governmental entity our government work carry various risk inherent in the government contracting process these risk include but are not limited to the following government entity particularly in the united state often reserve the right to audit our contract cost and conduct inquiry and investigation of our business practice and compliance with government contract requirement government agency including the defense contract audit agency routinely audit our contract cost including allocated indirect cost for compliance with the cost accounting standard and the federal acquisition regulation these agency also conduct review and investigation and make inquiry regarding our accounting information technology and other system in connection with our performance and business practice with respect to our government contract negative finding from existing and future audit investigation or inquiry or failure to comply with applicable it security or supply chain requirement could affect our future sale and profitability by preventing by operation of law or in practice from receiving new government contract for some period of time in addition if the government concludes that certain cost are not reimbursable have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimate of our work then we will not be allowed to bill for such cost may have to refund money that ha already been paid to or could be required to retroactively and prospectively adjust previously agreed to billing or pricing rate for our work negative finding from existing and future audit of our business system including our accounting system may result in the government preventing from billing at least temporarily percentage of our cost result of prior negative finding in connection with audit investigation and inquiry we have from time to time experienced some of the adverse consequence described above and may in the future experience further adverse consequence which could materially adversely affect our future result of operation if government client discovers improper or illegal activity in the course of audit or investigation we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalty including those under the civil false claim act and administrative sanction which may include termination of contract forfeiture of profit suspension of payment fine and suspension or debarment from doing business with other agency of that government the inherent limitation of internal control may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activity government contracting regulation impose strict compliance and heightened disclosure obligation from time to time we have made disclosure disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of credible evidence of violation of federal criminal law involving fraud conflict of interest bribery or improper gratuity violation of the civil false claim act or receipt of significant overpayment from the government failure to make required disclosure could be basis for suspension and or debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the federal level reported matter may also lead to audit or investigation and other civil criminal or administrative sanction including those described above government contract are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risk compared to contract with commercial client for example government contract and the proceeding surrounding them are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity negative publicity including an allegation of improper or illegal activity regardless of it accuracy may adversely affect our reputation term and condition of government contract also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate for example these contract often contain high or unlimited liability for breach and feature le favorable payment term and sometimes require to take on liability for the performance of third party government entity typically fund project through appropriated monies while these project are often planned and executed multi year project government entity usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these project for lack of approved funding and or at their convenience change in government or political development including budget deficit shortfall or uncertainty government spending reduction or other debt constraint could result in our project being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether which also could limit our recovery of incurred cost reimbursable expense and profit on work completed prior to the termination furthermore if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination cost we may not be able to fully recover our investment table of contentsaccenture form kitem risk factor political and economic factor such pending election the outcome of recent election change in leadership among key executive or legislative decision maker revision to governmental tax or other policy and reduced tax revenue can affect the number and term of new government contract signed or the speed at which new contract are signed decrease future level of spending and authorization for program that we bid shift spending priority to program in area for which we do not provide service and or lead to change in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rule or law is assessed our ability to work for the government is impacted by the fact that we are an irish company we elected to enter into proxy agreement with the department of defense that enhances the ability of our federal government contracting subsidiary to perform certain work for the government the proxy agreement regulates the management and operation of and limit the control we can exercise over this subsidiary in addition legislative and executive proposal remain under consideration or could be proposed in the future which if enacted could place additional limitation on or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contract in the united state or could include requirement that would otherwise affect our result of operation various federal and state legislative proposal have been introduced and or enacted in recent year that deny government contract to certain company that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the united state while accenture wa not company that reincorporated outside the united state it is possible that these contract ban and other legislative proposal could be applied in way that negatively affect accenture the occurrence or condition described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entity involved but also our business with other entity of the same or other governmental body or with certain commercial client and could have material adverse effect on our business or our result of operation if we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property right or if our service or solution infringe upon the intellectual property right of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others our business could be adversely affected our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our proprietary platform methodology process software and other solution existing law of the various country in which we provide service or solution may offer only limited intellectual property protection of our service or solution and the protection in some country may be very limited we rely upon combination of confidentiality policy and procedure nondisclosure and other contractual arrangement and patent trade secret copyright and trademark law to protect our intellectual property right these law are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to obtain or maintain intellectual property protection there is uncertainty concerning the scope of patent and other intellectual property protection for software and business method which are field in which we rely on intellectual property law to protect our right even where we obtain intellectual property protection our intellectual property right may not prevent or deter competitor former employee or other third party from reverse engineering our solution or proprietary methodology and process or independently developing service or solution similar to or duplicative of ours further the step we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitor former employee or other third party and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely step to enforce our intellectual property right enforcing our right might also require considerable time money and oversight and we may not be successful in enforcing our right in addition we can not be sure that our service and solution including for example our software solution or the solution of others that we offer to our client do not infringe on the intellectual property right of third party including competitor well non practicing holder of intellectual property asset and these third party could claim that we or our client are infringing upon their intellectual property right furthermore although we have established policy and procedure to respect the intellectual property right of third party and that prohibit the unauthorized use of intellectual property we may not be aware if our employee have misappropriated and or misused intellectual property and their action could result in claim of intellectual property misappropriation and or infringement from third party these claim could harm our reputation cause to incur substantial cost or prevent from offering some service or solution in the future any related proceeding could require to expend significant resource over an extended period of time in most of our contract we agree to indemnify our client for expense and liability resulting from claimed infringement of the intellectual property right of third party in some instance the amount of these indemnity could be greater than the revenue we receive from the client any claim or litigation in this area could be time consuming and costly damage our reputation and or require to incur additional cost to obtain the right to continue to offer service or solution to our client if

judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred tax asset tax exposure can involve complex issue and may require an extended period to resolve in assessing the realizability of deferred tax asset we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly factor considered in making this

determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeal or litigation process based on the technical merit of the position our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumption based on past experience judgment about potential action by taxing jurisdiction well judgment about the likely outcome of issue that have been raised by taxing jurisdiction the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon settlement we evaluate tax position each quarter and adjust the related tax liability or asset in light of changing fact and circumstance such the progress of tax audit or the expiration of statute of limitation we believe the estimate and assumption used to support our evaluation of tax position are reasonable however final determination of prior year tax liability either by settlement with tax authority or expiration of statute of limitation could be materially different from estimate reflected in asset and liability and historical income tax provision the outcome of these final determination could have material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flow in the period in which that determination is made we believe our tax position comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately

performance obligation performance obligation is promise in contract to transfer distinct good or service to the client and is the unit of accounting in topic contract transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized revenue when or the performance obligation is satisfied for contract with multiple performance obligation we allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus margin approach under which we forecast our expected cost of satisfying performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service based on margin for similar service sold on standalone basis while determining relative standalone selling price and identifying separate performance obligation require judgment generally relative standalone selling price and the separate performance obligation are readily identifiable we sell those performance obligation unaccompanied by other performance obligation contract modification are routine in the performance of our contract contract are often modified to account for change in the contract specification requirement or duration if contract modification result in the addition of performance obligation priced at standalone selling price or if the post modification service are distinct from the service provided prior to the modification the modification is accounted for separately if the modified service are not distinct they are accounted for part of the existing contract our revenue are derived from contract for outsourcing service technology integration consulting service and non technology integration consulting service these contract have different term based on the scope performance obligation and complexity of the engagement which frequently require to make judgment and estimate in recognizing revenue we have many type of contract including time and material contract fixed price contract fee per transaction contract and contract with multiple fee type the nature of our contract give rise to several type of variable consideration including incentive fee many contract include incentive or penalty related to cost incurred benefit produced or adherence to schedule that may increase the table of contentsnotes to

amount generally are awarded or refunded upon achievement of or failure to achieve certain performance metric milestone or cost target and can be based upon client discretion we include these variable fee in the estimated transaction price when there is basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee and it is not probable significant reversal of revenue will occur these estimate reflect the expected value of the variable fee and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance historical experience and other information available at the time our performance obligation are satisfied over time work progress or at point in time the majority of our revenue are recognized over time based on the extent of progress towards satisfying our performance obligation the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the contract and the nature of the service to be provided outsourcing contract our outsourcing contract typically span several year revenue are generally recognized on outsourcing contract over time because our client benefit from the service they are performed outsourcing contract require to provide series of

estimated cost at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligation incurred cost represents work performed which corresponds with and thereby best depicts the transfer of control to the client for non technology integration consulting contract which do not qualify to recognize revenue over time we recognize revenue at point in time when the client obtains control of the promised good or service contract estimate estimate of total contract revenue and cost are continuously monitored over the life of our contract and recorded revenue and cost estimate are subject to revision the contract progress if at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on technology integration consulting contract we recognize the loss in the quarter it first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract balance the timing of revenue recognition billing and cash collection result in receivables contract asset and deferred revenue contract liability on our consolidated balance sheet amount are billed work progress in accordance with agreed upon contractual term either at periodic interval monthly or quarterly or upon achievement of contractual milestone in limited circumstance we agree to extend financing to certain client the term vary by contract but generally payment for service is contractually linked to the achievement of specified performance milestone our receivables are right to consideration that are conditional only upon the passage of time compared to our contract asset which are right to consideration conditional upon additional factor when we bill or receive payment from our client before revenue is recognized we record contract liability contract asset and liability are reported on our consolidated balance sheet on contract by contract basis at the end of each reporting period for some outsourcing contract we receive payment for transition or set up activity which are deferred and
