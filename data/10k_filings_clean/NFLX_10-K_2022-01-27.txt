to broadcast medium and tax for example european law enables individual member state to impose levy and other financial obligation on medium operator located outside their jurisdiction several jurisdiction have and others may over time impose financial and regulatory obligation on in addition the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection law which may impose additional burden on if we are required to comply with new regulation or legislation or new interpretation of existing regulation or legislation this compliance could cause to incur additional expense or alter our business model change in law or regulation that adversely affect the growth popularity or use of the internet including law impacting

traverse their network have been implemented in many country including across the european union in others the law may be nascent or non existent furthermore favorable law may change including for example in the united state where net neutrality regulation were repealed given uncertainty around these rule including changing interpretation amendment or repeal coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operator we could experience discriminatory or anti competitive practice that could impede our growth cause to incur additional expense or otherwise

request from government authority and we may become subject to related claim and other action related to our business activity while the ultimate outcome of investigation inquiry information request and related legal proceeding is difficult to predict such matter can be expensive time consuming and distracting and adverse resolution or settlement of those matter may result in among other thing

accompanying note to our consolidated financial statement we anticipate that our future capital need from the debt market will be more limited compared to prior year our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to or need to obtain will depend on among other thing our development effort business plan operating performance and the condition of the capital market at the

right preference or privilege senior to the right of our common stock and our stockholder may experience dilution in march our board of director authorized the repurchase of up to billion of our

contractual obligation table above doe not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future title payment for which could range from le than one year to more than five year however these unknown obligation are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately billion to billion over the next three year with the payment for the vast majority of such amount expected to occur after the next twelve month the foregoing range is based on considerable management judgment and the actual amount may differ once we know the title that we will receive and the license fee we include the amount in the contractual obligation table above debt obligation include our note consisting of principal and interest payment see note debt in the accompanying note to our consolidated

million wa classified in other non current liability in the consolidated balance sheet at this time an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustment to the balance of unrecognized tax benefit can not be made free cash flowwe define free cash flow cash provided by used in operating activity le purchase of property and equipment and change in other asset we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measure during given period the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligation make strategic acquisition and investment and for certain other activity like share repurchase free cash flow is considered non gaap financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of or substitute for net income operating income cash flow provided by used in operating activity or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap in assessing liquidity in relation to our result of operation we compare free cash flow to net income noting that the major recurring difference are excess content payment over amortization non cash stock based compensation expense non cash remeasurement gain loss on our euro denominated debt and other working capital difference working capital difference include deferred revenue excess property and equipment purchase over depreciation tax and semi annual interest payment on our outstanding debt our receivables from member generally settle quickly year ended december change in thousand net cash provided by used in operating activity net cash used in

content that require more of contentsupfront cash payment partially offset by million or increase in revenue the payment for content asset increased million from million to million or compared to the increase in the amortization of content asset of million from million to million or the increase in payment for content asset wa primarily driven by delay in production resulting from the pandemic that impacted the prior year which resulted in the timing of certain production payment being shifted into the current year in addition we had increased payment associated with higher operating expense primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvement in our streaming service and our international expansion net cash used in investing activity increased million primarily due to acquisition net cash provided by used in financing activity decreased million primarily due to no debt issuance in the year ended december compared to proceeds from the issuance of

compensation expense and million non cash valuation allowance on the california credit indemnificationsthe information set forth under note guarantee indemnification obligation in the accompanying note to our consolidated financial statement included in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data of this annual report on form is incorporated herein by reference critical accounting estimatesthe preparation of consolidated financial statement in conformity with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reported period the security and exchange commission sec ha defined company critical accounting policy the one that are most important to the portrayal of company financial condition and result of operation and which require company to make it most difficult and subjective judgment based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policy and judgment addressed we base our estimate on historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance actual result may differ from these estimate content we acquire license and produce content including original programming in order to offer our member unlimited viewing of video entertainment the content license are for fixed fee and specific window of availability payment term for certain content license and the production of content require more upfront cash payment relative to the amortization expense payment for content including addition to content asset and the change in related liability are classified within net cash provided by used in operating activity on the consolidated statement of cash flow we recognize content asset licensed and produced content asset net on the consolidated balance sheet for licensed content we capitalize the fee per title and record corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begin the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming for produced content we capitalize cost associated with the production including development cost direct cost and production overhead participation and residual are expensed in line with the amortization of production cost based on factor including historical and estimated viewing pattern we amortize the content asset licensed and produced in cost of revenue on the consolidated statement of operation over the shorter of each title contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten year beginning with the month of first availability the amortization is on an accelerated basis we typically expect more upfront viewing and film amortization is more accelerated than tv of contentsseries amortization on average over of licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four year after it month of first availability we review factor that impact the amortization of the content asset on regular basis our estimate related to these factor require considerable management judgment our business model is subscription based opposed to model generating revenue at specific title level content asset licensed and produced are predominantly monetized group and therefore are reviewed at group level when an event or change in circumstance indicates change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be le than unamortized cost to date we have not identified any such event or change in circumstance if such change are identified in the future these aggregated content asset will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value in addition unamortized cost for asset that have been or are expected to be abandoned are written income taxeswe record provision for income tax for the anticipated tax consequence of our reported result of operation using the asset and liability method deferred income tax are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rate applicable to future year to difference between the financial statement carrying amount of existing asset and liability and their respective tax base well net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the effect on deferred tax asset and liability of change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date the measurement of deferred tax asset is reduced if necessary by valuation allowance for any tax benefit for which future realization is uncertain although we believe our assumption judgment and estimate are reasonable change in tax law or our interpretation of tax law and the resolution of any tax audit could significantly impact the amount provided for income tax in our consolidated financial statement in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax asset in full or in part we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating result and our forecast of future earnings future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategy the assumption utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plan and estimate we are using to manage the underlying business actual operating result in future year could differ from our current assumption judgment and estimate however we believe that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet will ultimately be realized we record valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized of december the valuation allowance of million wa related to the california research and development credit and certain foreign tax attribute that we do not expect to realize we did not recognize certain tax benefit from uncertain tax position within the provision for income tax we may recognize tax benefit if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement from such position are then measured based on the largest benefit that ha greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement at december our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefit were million of which million if recognized would favorably impact our future earnings due to uncertainty in any tax audit outcome our estimate of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax position may change and the actual tax benefit may differ significantly from the estimate see note income tax to the consolidated financial statement for further information regarding income tax recent accounting pronouncementsthe

billion of debt consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in fifteen tranche due between and refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for detail about all issuance the fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movement of interest rate increasing in period of declining rate of interest and declining in of contentsperiods of increasing rate of interest the fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on change in foreign currency rate discussed below foreign currency riskrevenues denominated in currency other than the dollar account for of the consolidated amount for the year ended december we therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currency which are primarily the euro the british pound the brazilian real the canadian dollar the mexican peso the australian dollar and the japanese yen accordingly change in exchange rate and in particular weakening of foreign currency relative to the dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income expressed in dollar for the year ended december our revenue would have been approximately million lower had foreign currency exchange rate remained constant with those for the year ended december we have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuation in our net income result of gain loss on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary asset and liability denominated in currency that are not the functional currency in the year ended december we recognized million foreign exchange gain primarily due to the non cash remeasurement of our senior note denominated in euro partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability position denominated in currency other than functional currency in addition the effect of exchange rate change on cash and cash equivalent in the year ended december wa an decrease of million we do not use foreign exchange contract or derivative to hedge any foreign currency exposure the volatility of exchange rate depends on many factor that
