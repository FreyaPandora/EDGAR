preference among other factor in order to increase our responsiveness to our customer and to improve our sale and customer retention the marketing organization manages all sale channel including inbound direct sale on line outbound telemarketing and store we believe that offering wide variety of video programming choice influence customer decision to subscribe and retain our cable video service we obtain basic and premium programming usually pursuant to written contract from number of supplier medium corporation consolidation ha however resulted in fewer supplier and additional selling power on the part of programming supplier although an insignificant amount of our programming budget recently we have begun entering into agreement to co produce or exclusively license original content which give the right to provide our customer with certain exclusive content for period of time programming is usually made available to for license fee which is generally paid based on the number of customer to we make that programming available programming license fee may include volume discount and financial incentive to support the launch of channel and or ongoing marketing support well discount for channel placement or service penetration for home shopping channel we typically receive percentage of the revenue attributable to our customer purchase we also offer vod and pay per view channel of movie and event that are subject to revenue split with the content provider our programming cost have increased in excess of customary inflationary and cost of living type increase we expect programming cost per customer to continue to increase due to variety of factor including annual increase pursuant to our programming contract contract renewal with programmer and the carriage of incremental programming including new service and vod programming increase in the cost of sport programming and the amount paid for broadcast station retransmission consent have been the largest contributor to the growth in our programming cost over the last few year additionally the demand of large medium company who link carriage of their most popular network to carriage and cost increase of their le popular network and who require to carry their most popular network to large percentage of our video subscriber ha limited our flexibility in creating more tailored and cost sensitive programming package for consumer federal law allows commercial television broadcast station to make an election between must carry right and an alternative retransmission consent regime when station opts for retransmission consent we are not allowed to carry the station signal without that station permission continuing demand by owner of broadcast station for cash payment at substantial increase over amount paid in prior year in exchange for retransmission consent will increase our programming cost or require to cease carriage of popular programming potentially leading to loss of customer in affected service area over the past several year increase in our video service rate have not fully offset the increase in our programming cost and with the impact of increasing competition and other marketplace factor we not expect the increase in our video service rate to fully offset the increase in our programming cost for the foreseeable future although we pas along portion of amount paid for retransmission consent to the majority of our customer our inability to fully pas programming cost increase on to our video customer ha and is expected in the future to have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margin associated with our video product in order to mitigate reduction of our operating margin due to rapidly increasing programming cost we continue to review our pricing and programming packaging strategy our programming contract are generally for fixed period of time usually for multiple year and are subject to negotiated renewal the contract set to expire in any particular year vary we will seek to renew these agreement on term that we believe are favorable there can be no assurance however that these agreement will be renewed on favorable or comparable term to the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmer on term that we believe are reasonable we have been and may in the future be forced to remove such

regional competitorsin some of our operating area other competitor have built network that offer video internet and voice service that compete with our service for example in certain service area our residential video internet and voice service compete with google fiber cincinnati bell inc hawaiian telcom owned by cincinnati bell inc rcn telecom service llc grande communication network llc and wow additional competitionin addition to multi channel video provider cable system compete with other source of news information and entertainment including over the air television broadcast reception

private residential community business serviceswe face intense competition across each of our business service product offering our small and medium business video internet networking and voice service face competition from variety of provider described our enterprise solution also face competition from the competitor described above well application service provider and other telecommunication carrier such metro and regional fiber based carrier advertisingwe face intense competition for advertising revenue across many different platform and from wide range of local and national competitor advertising competition ha increased and will likely continue to increase new advertising avenue seek to attract the same advertiser we compete for advertising revenue against among others local broadcast station national cable and broadcast network radio station print medium and online advertising company and content provider and cyclicality our business is subject to seasonal and cyclical variation our result are impacted by the seasonal nature of customer receiving our cable service in college and vacation service area our revenue is subject to cyclical advertising pattern and change in viewership level our advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth calendar quarter of each year due in part to increase in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season advertising revenue is also cyclical benefiting in even numbered year from advertising related to candidate running for political office and issue oriented advertising our capital expenditure and trade working capital are also subject to significant seasonality based on the timing of subscriber growth network program specific project and construction regulation and legislation the following summary address the key regulatory and legislative development affecting the cable industry and our service for both residential and commercial customer cable system operation are extensively regulated by the federal government primarily the fcc certain state government and many local government failure to comply with these regulation could subject to substantial penalty our business can be dramatically impacted by change to the existing regulatory framework whether triggered by legislative administrative or judicial ruling congress and the fcc have frequently revisited the subject of communication regulation and they are likely to do in the future we could be materially disadvantaged in the future if we are subject to new law regulation or regulatory action that do not equally impact our key competitor we can not provide assurance that the already extensive regulation of our business will not be expanded in the future in addition we are already subject to charter specific condition regarding certain business practice result of the fcc approval of the merger in with time warner cable inc twc and acquisition of bright house network llc bright house video servicemust carry retransmission consentthere are two alternative legal method for carriage of local broadcast television station on cable system federal must carry regulation require cable system to carry local broadcast television station upon the request of the local broadcaster alternatively federal law includes retransmission consent regulation by which popular commercial television station can prohibit cable carriage unless the cable operator first negotiates for retransmission consent which may be conditioned on significant payment or other concession popular station invoking retransmission consent have been demanding substantial compensation increase in their recent negotiation with cable operator thereby significantly increasing our operating cost pole attachmentsthe communication act of amended the communication act requires most utility owning utility pole to provide cable system with access to pole and conduit and also subject the rate charged for this access to either federal or state regulation the federally regulated rate now applicable to pole attachment used for cable internet and telecommunication service are substantially similar the fcc approach doe not directly affect the rate in state that self regulate but many of those state have substantially the same rate for all communication attachment some municipality have enacted one touch make ready pole attachment ordinance which permit third party to alter component of our network attached to utility pole in way that could adversely affect our business some of these ordinance have been challenged with differing result in the fcc adopted one touch make ready otmr rule that will apply in state pole attachment are fcc regulated and they may impact many of our existing pole attachment various utility have sought review of the otmr rule in federal court cable rate regulationpursuant to federal law cable system video offering are universally exempt from rate regulation except for cable system minimum level of video programming service referred to basic service and associated equipment fcc regulation require local franchise authority interested in regulating rate for basic service and associated equipment to first make an affirmative showing that there is no effective competition defined under federal law in the community given the competitive nature of our market the fcc recently rescinded certification for the relatively few community where we had been subject to rate regulation it is possible that the competitive situation could change and that some local franchising authority may be certified to regulate rate in the future and existing and potential law and regulation may affect our marketing practice including our disclosure and itemization of subscriber fee fcc regulatory mattersthe communication act and fcc regulation cover variety of additional area including among other thing licensing of system and facility equal employment opportunity obligation customer service standard technical service standard mandatory blackout of certain network and syndicated programming restriction on political advertising restriction on advertising in child programming ownership restriction maintenance of public file emergency alert system inside wiring and exclusive contract for mdu complex disability access including requirement governing video description and closed captioning competitive availability of cable equipment the provision of up to of video channel capacity for commercial leased access by unaffiliated third party and public education and government entity access requirement each of these regulation restricts our business practice to varying degree and may impose additional cost on our operation further the fcc regulates spectrum usage and other communication enterprise in way that could impact our operation for example the fcc is currently considering proposal to reallocate certain spectrum for new wireless communication purpose which could be disruptive to the satellite platform we rely upon to provide our video service the fcc is also preparing to make additional spectrum available for commercial service which we might use to deliver service in the future our ability to access and use such spectrum is uncertain and may be limited by further fcc auction or allocation decision it is possible that congress or the fcc will expand or modify it regulation of cable system in the future and we can not predict at this time how that might impact our business copyrightcable system are subject to federal compulsory copyright license covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signal the copyright law provides copyright owner the right to audit our payment under the compulsory license and the copyright office is currently considering modification to the license royalty calculation and reporting obligation the possible modification or elimination of this license is the subject of continuing legislative proposal and administrative review and could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast programming franchise mattersour cable system generally are operated pursuant to nonexclusive franchise permit and similar authorization granted by municipality or other state or local government entity in order to utilize and cross public right of way cable franchise generally are granted for fixed term and in many case include monetary penalty for noncompliance and may be terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provision the specific term and condition of cable franchise vary significantly between jurisdiction they generally contain provision governing cable operation franchise fee system construction maintenance technical performance customer service standard supporting and carrying public access channel and change in the ownership of the franchisee although local franchising authority have considerable discretion in establishing franchise term certain federal protection benefit cable operator for example federal law imposes cap on franchise fee in august the fcc clarified that in kind contribution requirement set forth in cable franchise are subject to the statutory cap on franchise fee and it reaffirmed that state and local authority are barred from imposing duplicative franchise and or fee requirement on franchised cable system providing non cable service an appeal of the fcc order is pending in federal court number of state have adopted franchising law that provide for statewide franchising generally state wide cable franchise are issued for fixed term but streamline many of the traditional local cable franchise requirement and eliminate local negotiation the communication act provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which granting authority may not unreasonably deny renewal if we fail to obtain renewal of franchise representing significant number of our customer it could have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition result of operation or our liquidity similarly if franchising authority consent is required for the purchase or sale of cable system the franchising authority may attempt to impose more burdensome requirement condition for providing it consent internet servicethe fcc originally classified broadband internet access service such those we offer an information service which exempted the service from traditional communication common carrier law and regulation in the fcc reclassified broadband internet access service telecommunication service and on that basis imposed number of net neutrality rule governing the provision of broadband service in the fcc reversed it decision the commission order restored the information service classification and eliminated the rule other than transparency requirement which an obligation to disclose performance statistic and other service information to consumer the fcc decision also ruled that state regulator may not impose obligation similar to federal network neutrality obligation that the fcc eliminated in the court of appeal for the district of columbia upheld the fcc information service reclassification but vacated the fcc blanket prohibition of state utility regulation of broadband service the court left open the possibility that individual state law could be deemed preempted on case by case basis if it is shown that they conflict with federal law we understand that this decision may be subject to further judicial review several state including california have already adopted state obligation and additional state may consider the imposition of new regulation on our internet service such rule similar to the network neutrality requirement that were eliminated by the fcc california legislation ha been challenged in court and we can not predict how the challenge to california legislation or challenge to any future state legislation will be resolved recent history ha shown it is possible that the fcc might further revise it approach to broadband internet access or that congress might enact legislation affecting the rule applicable to the service the application of new legal requirement to our internet service could adversely affect our business in recent year the fcc ha demonstrated an interest in accelerating advancement in and deployment of wired and wireless broadband infrastructure including advanced wireless service for example the fcc and some state regulatory commission direct certain subsidy to telephone and other company deploying broadband to area deemed to be unserved or underserved we have opposed such subsidy when directed to area that we serve however continued regulatory effort to accelerate competitive wireline and wireless broadband deployment including reform that create regulatory imbalance could adversely affect our business aside from the fcc generally applicable regulation we have made certain commitment to comply with the fcc order in connection with the fcc approval of the merger with twc and acquisition of bright house discussed below wireline voice servicethe fcc ha never classified the voip telephone service we offer telecommunication service that are subject to traditional federal common carrier regulation but instead ha imposed some of these requirement on case by case basis such requirement relating to emergency service communication assistance for law enforcement act calea the statute governing law enforcement access to and surveillance of communication universal service fund contribution customer privacy and customer proprietary network information protection number portability network outage reporting rural call completion disability access regulatory fee back up power obligation and discontinuance of service it is possible that the fcc or congress will impose additional requirement on our voip telephone service in the future although we believe that voip telephone service should be governed only by federal regulation some state have attempted to subject cable voip service to state level regulation and at least one state ha asserted jurisdiction over our voip service we prevailed on legal challenge to that state assertion of jurisdiction which wa affirmed by federal appellate court but that ruling is limited to the seven state in that circuit although we have registered with or obtained certificate or authorization from the fcc and the state regulatory authority in those state in which we offer competitive voice service in order to ensure the continuity of our service it is unclear whether and how these and other ongoing regulatory matter ultimately will be resolved state regulatory commission and legislature in other jurisdiction may continue to consider imposing regulatory requirement on our fixed telephone service mobile service our spectrum mobile service offer mobile internet access and telephone service we provide this service an mvno using verizon network and our network of spectrum wi fi hotspot an mvno we are subject to many of the same fcc regulation that apply to facility based wireless carrier well certain state or local regulation including but not limited to local number portability customer privacy calea universal service fund contribution and hearing aid compatibility and safety and emission requirement for mobile device spectrum mobile broadband internet access service is also subject to the fcc transparency rule the fcc or other regulatory authority may adopt new or different regulation for mvnos and or mobile service provider in the future or impose new tax or fee applicable to spectrum mobile which could adversely affect the service offering or our business generally privacy and information security regulationthe communication act limit our ability to collect use and disclose customer personally identifiable information for our video voice and internet service we are subject to additional federal state and local law and regulation that impose additional restriction on the collection use and disclosure of consumer information all broadband provider are also obliged by calea configure their network in manner that facilitates the ability of state and federal law enforcement with proper legal process authorized under the electronic communication privacy act to obtain record and information concerning our customer including the content of their communication further the fcc federal trade commission ftc and many state regulate and restrict the marketing practice of communication service provider including telemarketing and sending unsolicited commercial email the ftc currently ha the authority pursuant to it general authority to enforce against unfair or deceptive act and practice to protect the privacy of internet service customer including our use and disclosure of certain customer information our operation are also subject to federal and state law governing information security in the event of an information security breach such rule may require consumer and government agency notification and may result in regulatory enforcement action with the potential of monetary forfeiture the fcc the ftc and state attorney general regularly bring enforcement action against company related to information security breach and privacy violation various security standard provide guidance to telecommunication company in order to help identify and mitigate cybersecurity risk one such standard is the voluntary framework released by the national institute for standard and technology nist in and updated in in cooperation with other federal agency and owner and operator of critical infrastructure the nist cybersecurity framework provides prioritized and flexible model for organization to identify and manage cyber risk inherent to their business it wa designed to supplement not supersede existing cybersecurity regulation and requirement several government agency have encouraged compliance with the nist cybersecurity framework including the fcc which is also considering expansion of it cybersecurity guideline or the adoption of cybersecurity requirement many state and local authority have considered legislative or other action that would impose restriction on our ability to collect use and disclose and safeguard certain consumer information particularly with regard to our broadband internet business for example the california consumer privacy act and maine act to protect privacy of online customer information are both scheduled go into effect in the california law will under certain circumstance regulate company use and disclosure of the personal information of california resident and authorizes enforcement action by the california attorney general and private class action for data breach the maine law regulates how internet service provider use and disclose customer personal information and requires internet service provider to take reasonable measure to protect customer personal information we expect state and local effort to regulate consumer privacy to continue in additionally several state legislature are considering the adoption of new data security and cybersecurity legislation that could result in additional network and information security requirement for our business we expect such state activity to increase result of the recent court of appeal decision that while affirming the fcc reclassification of internet access an information service vacated the fcc blanket prohibition of state regulation of broadband service and instead left open the possibility that individual state law could be deemed preempted on case by case basis if it is shown that they conflict with federal law there are also bill pending in both the house of representative and senate that could impose new privacy and data security obligation we can not predict whether any of these effort will be successful or preempted or how new legislation and regulation if any would affect our business commitment related to the merger with twc and acquisition of bright housein connection with approval of the merger with twc and acquisition of bright house the transaction federal and state regulator imposed number of post transaction condition on including but not limited to the following fcc condition offer settlement free internet interconnection to any party that meet the requirement of our interconnection policy available on

relevant rule the fcc condition also contain number of compliance reporting requirement conditionsthe department of justice doj order prohibits from entering into or enforcing any agreement with video programmer that forbids limit or creates incentive to limit the video programmer provision of content to online video distributor ovds we will not be able to avail ourself of other distributor most favored nation mfn provision if they are inconsistent with this prohibition the doj condition are effective for seven year after entry of the final judgment in although we may petition the doj to eliminate the condition after five year state conditionscertain state regulator including california new york hawaii and new jersey also imposed condition in connection with the approval of the transaction these condition include requirement related to building out our network to certain household and business location that are not currently served by cable within the designated state offering lifeline service discount and low income broadband to eligible household served within the applicable state investing in service improvement program and customer service enhancement and maintaining customer facing job within the designated state and complying with reporting requirement employee of december we had approximately active full time equivalent employee item risk factor risk related to our businesswe operate in competitive business environment which affect our ability to attract and retain customer and can adversely affect our business operation and financial result the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and ha become more so in recent year in some instance we compete against company with fewer regulatory burden access to better financing greater personnel resource greater resource for marketing greater and more favorable brand name recognition and long established relationship with regulatory authority and customer increasing consolidation in the telecommunication and content industry have provided additional benefit to certain of our competitor either through access to financing resource or efficiency of scale including the ability to launch new video service our video service face competition from number of source including db service well other company that deliver linear network programming movie and television show on demand and other video content over broadband internet connection to television computer tablet and mobile device often with password sharing among multiple user and security that make content susceptible to piracy newer product and service particularly alternative method for the distribution sale and viewing of content will likely continue to be developed further increasing the number of competitor that we face the increasing number of choice available to audience including low cost or free choice could negatively impact not only consumer demand for our product and service but also advertiser willingness to purchase advertising from we compete for the sale of advertising revenue with television network and station well other advertising platform such radio print and increasingly online medium our internet service face competition from the phone company ftth fttn dsl and wireless broadband offering well from variety of company that offer other form of online service including fixed wireless and satellite based broadband service various mobile phone company offer wireless internet service delivered over network which they continue to enhance to deliver faster speed and some began deploying mobile service in with plan to expand more broadly in the our voice and mobile service compete with wireless and wireline phone provider well other form of communication such text messaging on cellular phone instant messaging social networking service video conferencing and email competition from these company including intensive marketing effort with aggressive pricing exclusive programming and increased hd broadcasting may have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain customer and wireless overbuilds could also adversely affect our growth financial condition and result of operation by creating or increasing competition we are aware of traditional overbuild situation impacting certain of our service area however we are unable to predict the extent to which additional overbuild situation may occur our service may not allow to compete effectively our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to new technology and change in consumer expectation and behavior could significantly adversely affect our competitive position with respect to the leisure time and discretionary spending of our customer and result affect our business and result of operation competition may also reduce our expected growth of future cash flow which may contribute to future impairment of our franchise and goodwill and our ability to meet cash flow requirement including debt service requirement for additional information regarding the competition we face see item business competition and regulation and legislation we face risk inherent in our commercial business we may encounter unforeseen difficulty we increase the scale of our service offering to business we sell internet access data networking and fiber connectivity to office building and cellular tower and video and business voice service to business in order to grow our commercial business we expect to continue to invest in technology equipment and personnel focused on the commercial business commercial business customer often require service level agreement and generally have heightened customer expectation for reliability of service if our effort to build the infrastructure to scale the commercial business are not successful the growth of our commercial service business would be limited we depend on interconnection and related service provided by certain third party for the growth of our commercial business result our ability to implement change the service grow may be limited if we are unable to meet these service level requirement or expectation our commercial business could be adversely affected competition continues to increase well more company deploy more fiber to more building which may negatively impact our growth and or put pressure on margin finally we expect advance in communication technology well change in the marketplace and the regulatory and legislative environment consequently we are unable to predict the effect that ongoing or future development in these area might have on our commercial business and operation programming cost per video customer are rising at much faster rate than wage or inflation and we may not have the ability to reduce or moderate the growth rate of or pas on to our customer our increasing programming cost which would adversely affect our cash flow and operating margin video programming ha been and is expected to continue to be our largest operating expense item in recent year the cable industry ha experienced rapid escalation in programming rate medium corporation consolidation ha resulted in fewer supplier and additional selling power on the part of programming supplier we expect programming rate will continue to increase due to variety of factor including annual increase imposed by programmer with additional selling power result of medium consolidation increased demand by owner of broadcast station for payment for retransmission consent or linking carriage of other service to retransmission consent and additional programming particularly new service the inability to fully pas programming cost increase on to our customer ha had and is expected in the future to have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margin associated with the video product the contract set to expire in any particular year vary there can be no assurance that these agreement will be renewed on favorable or comparable term in addition number of programmer have begun to sell their service through alternative distribution channel including ip based platform which are le secure than our own video distribution platform there is growing evidence that these le secure video distribution platform are leading to video product theft via password sharing among consumer password sharing may drive the number of customer who pay for certain programming putting programmer revenue at risk and which in turn may cause certain programmer to seek even higher programming fee from the ability for consumer to receive the same content for free through such unauthorized channel ha devalued our video product which could impact sale customer retention and our ability to pas through programming cost to consumer which increase the risk of non renewal when programmer seek increase to the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmer on term that we believe are reasonable we have been and may be in the future forced to remove such programming channel from our line up which may result in loss of customer our failure to carry programming that is attractive to our customer could adversely impact our customer level operation and financial result in addition if our internet customer are unable to access desirable content online content provider block or limit access by our customer class our ability to gain and retain customer especially internet customer may be negatively impacted increased demand by owner of some broadcast station for carriage of other service or payment to those broadcaster for retransmission consent are likely to further increase our programming cost federal law allows commercial television broadcast station to make an election between must carry right and an alternative retransmission consent regime when station opts for the retransmission consent regime we are not allowed to carry the station signal without that station permission in some case we carry station under short term arrangement while we attempt to negotiate new long term retransmission agreement if negotiation with these programmer prove unsuccessful they could require to cease carrying their signal possibly for an indefinite period any loss of station could make our video service le attractive to customer which could result in le and advertising revenue in retransmission consent negotiation broadcaster often condition consent with respect to one station on carriage of one or more other station or programming service in which they or their affiliate have an interest carriage of these other service well increased fee for retransmission right may increase our programming expense and diminish the amount of capacity we have available to introduce new service which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial result our inability to respond to technological development and meet customer demand for new product and service could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively we operate in highly competitive consumer driven and rapidly changing environment from time to time we may pursue strategic initiative including for example our wireless strategy which includes the launch of our mobile product through an mvno and testing the deployment of unlicensed and licensed spectrum for fixed and mobile wireless service our success is to large extent dependent on our ability to acquire develop adopt upgrade and exploit new and existing technology to address consumer changing demand and distinguish our service from those of our competitor we may not be able to accurately predict technological trend or the success of new product and service if we choose technology or equipment that are le effective cost efficient or attractive to customer than those chosen by our competitor if we offer service that fail to appeal to consumer are not available at competitive price or that do not function expected or we are not able to fund the expenditure necessary to keep pace with technological development our competitive position could deteriorate and our business and financial result could suffer the ability of some of our competitor to introduce new technology product and service more quickly than we do may adversely affect our competitive position furthermore advance in technology decrease in the cost of existing technology or change in competitor product and service offering may require in the future to make additional research and development expenditure or to offer at no additional charge or at lower price certain product and service that we currently offer to customer separately or at premium in addition the uncertainty of our ability and the cost to obtain intellectual property right from third party could impact our ability to respond to technological advance in timely and effective manner our inability to maintain and expand our upgraded system and provide advanced service such state of the art user interface in timely manner or to anticipate the demand of the marketplace could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customer in addition we launch our new mobile service using virtual network operator right from third party we expect an initial funding period to grow new product well negative working capital impact from the timing of device related cash flow when we provide the handset or tablet pursuant to equipment installation plan consequently our growth financial condition and result of operation could suffer materially we depend on third party service provider supplier and licensors thus if we are unable to procure the necessary service equipment software or license on reasonable term and on timely basis our ability to offer service could be impaired and our growth operation business financial result and financial condition could be materially adversely affected we depend on limited number of third party service provider supplier and licensors to supply some of the service hardware software and operational support necessary to provide some of our service some of our hardware software and operational support vendor and service provider represent our sole source of supply or have either through contract or result of intellectual property right position of some exclusivity if any of these party breach or terminates it agreement with or otherwise fails to perform it obligation in timely manner demand exceeds these vendor capacity tariff are imposed that impact vendor ability to perform their obligation or significantly increase the amount we pay they experience operating or financial difficulty they significantly increase the amount we pay for necessary product or service or they cease production of any necessary product due to lack of demand profitability or change in ownership or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or service we need in timely manner at our specification and at reasonable price our ability to provide some service might be materially adversely affected or the need to procure or develop alternative source of the affected material or service might delay our ability to serve our customer in addition the existence of only limited number of vendor of key technology can lead to le product innovation and higher cost these event could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customer and our operation business financial result and financial condition our business may be adversely affected if we can not continue to license or enforce the intellectual property right on which our business depends we rely on patent copyright trademark and trade secret law and license and other agreement with our employee customer supplier and other party to establish and maintain our intellectual property right in technology and the product and service used in our operation also because of the rapid pace of technological change we both develop our own technology product and service and rely on technology developed or licensed by third party however any of our intellectual property right or right of our supplier could be challenged or invalidated or such intellectual property right may not be sufficient to permit to take advantage of current industry trend or otherwise to provide competitive advantage which could result in costly redesign effort discontinuance of certain product or service offering or other competitive harm we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain license from these third party on reasonable term if at all in addition claim of intellectual property infringement could require to enter into royalty or licensing agreement on unfavorable term incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question which could require to change our business practice or offering and limit our ability to compete effectively even unsuccessful claim can be time consuming and costly to defend and may divert management attention and resource away from our business infringement claim continue to be brought frequently in the communication and entertainment industry and we are also often party to such litigation alleging that certain of our service or technology infringe the intellectual property right of others various event could disrupt or result in unauthorized access to our network information system or property and could impair our operating activity and negatively impact our reputation and financial result network and information system technology are critical to our operating activity both for our internal us such network management and supplying service to our customer including customer service operation and programming delivery network or information system shutdown or other service disruption caused by event such computer hacking phishing dissemination of computer virus worm and other destructive or disruptive software cyber attack process breakdown denial of service attack and other malicious activity pose increasing risk both unsuccessful and successful cyber attack on company have continued to increase in frequency scope and potential harm in recent year while we develop and maintain system seeking to prevent system related event and security breach from occurring the development and maintenance of these system is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating technique used in such attack become more sophisticated and change frequently we and the third party on which we rely may be unable to anticipate these technique or implement adequate preventive measure while from time to time attempt have been made to access our network these attempt have not yet resulted in any material release of information degradation or disruption to our network and information system our network and information system are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outage telecommunication failure accident natural disaster including extreme weather arising from short term or any long term change in weather pattern terrorist attack and similar event our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventuality any of these event if directed at or experienced by or technology upon which we depend could have adverse consequence on our network our customer and our business including degradation of service service disruption excessive call volume to call center and damage to our or our customer equipment and data large expenditure may be necessary to repair or replace damaged property network or information system or to protect them from similar event in the future moreover the amount and scope of insurance that we maintain against loss resulting from any such event or security breach may not be sufficient to cover our loss or otherwise adequately compensate for any disruption to our business that may result any such significant service disruption could result in damage to our reputation and credibility customer dissatisfaction and ultimately loss of customer or revenue any significant loss of customer or revenue or significant increase in cost of serving those customer could adversely affect our growth financial condition and result of operation furthermore our operating activity could be subject to risk caused by misappropriation misuse leakage falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology system and network and those of our third party vendor including customer personnel and vendor data we provide certain confidential proprietary and personal information to third party in connection with our business and there is risk that this information may be compromised we process store and transmit large amount of data including the personal information of our customer ongoing increase in the potential for mi use of personal information the public awareness of the importance of safeguarding personal information and the volume of legislation that ha been adopted or is considered regarding the protection privacy and security of personal information have resulted in increase to our information related risk we could be exposed to significant cost if such risk were to materialize and such event could damage our reputation credibility and business and have negative impact on our revenue we could be subject to regulatory action and claim made by consumer in private litigation involving privacy issue related to consumer data collection and use practice we also could be required to expend significant capital and other resource to remedy any such security breach exposure to the economic condition of our current and potential customer vendor and third party could adversely affect our cash flow result of operation and financial condition we are exposed to risk associated with the economic condition of our current and potential customer the potential financial instability of our customer and their financial ability to purchase our product if there were general economic downturn we may experience increased cancellation or non payment by our customer or unfavorable change in the mix of product purchased this may include an increase in the number of home that replace their video service with internet delivered and or over air content well an increase in the number of internet and voice customer substituting mobile data and voice product for wireline service which would negatively impact our ability to attract customer increase rate and maintain or increase revenue in addition our ability to gain new customer is dependent to some extent on growth in occupied housing in our service area which is influenced by both national and local economic condition weak economic condition may also have negative impact on our advertising revenue these event have adversely affected in the past and may adversely affect our cash flow result of operation and financial condition if downturn were to occur in addition we are susceptible to risk associated with the potential financial instability of the vendor and third party on which we rely to provide product and service or to which we outsource certain function the same economic condition that may affect our customer well volatility and disruption in the capital and credit market also could adversely affect vendor and third party and lead to significant increase in price reduction in output or the bankruptcy of our vendor or third party upon which we rely any interruption in the service provided by our vendor or by third party could adversely affect our cash flow result of operation and financial condition for tax purpose charter could experience deemed ownership change in the future that could limit it ability to use it tax loss carryforwards charter had approximately

vulnerable to interest rate increase in part because approximately of our borrowing of december were and may continue to be subject to variable rate of interest expose to increased interest expense to the extent we refinance existing debt with higher cost debt require to dedicate significant portion of our cash flow from operating activity to make payment on our debt reducing our fund available for

technical standard marketing practice customer service and consumer protection and approval for merger and acquisition often accompanied by the imposition of restriction and requirement on an applicant business in order to secure approval of the proposed transaction legislator and regulator at all level of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statute rule regulation or interpretation thereof or prescribe new one any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative action may increase our cost or impose additional restriction on our business result of the closing of the merger with twc and acquisition of bright house our business are subject to the condition set forth in the fcc order and the doj consent decree and those imposed by state utility commission and local franchise authority and there can be no assurance that these condition will not have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation in connection with

high speed internet program for low income family these and other condition and commitment relating to the transaction are of varying duration ranging from three to seven year in light of the breadth and duration of the condition and potential change in market condition during the time the condition and commitment are in effect there can be no assurance that our compliance and ability to comply with the condition will not have material adverse effect on our business or result of operation change to existing statute rule regulation or interpretation thereof or adoption of new one could have an adverse effect on our business there are ongoing effort to amend or expand the federal state and local regulation of some of the service offered over our cable system which may compound the regulatory risk we already face for example with respect to our retail broadband internet access service the fcc ha reclassified the service twice in the last few year with the first change adding federal regulatory obligation and the second change largely removing those new regulatory obligation these change reflect lack of regulatory certainty in this business area which may continue result of litigation well future legislative or administrative change other potential legislative and regulatory change could adversely impact our business by increasing our cost and competition and limiting our ability to offer service in manner that that would maximize our revenue potential these change could include example the adoption of new privacy restriction on our collection use and disclosure of certain customer information new data security and cybersecurity mandate that could result in additional network and information security requirement for our business new restraint on our discretion over programming decision including commercial leased access programming new restriction on the rate we charge for video programming and the marketing and packaging of that video programming and other service to consumer change to the cable industry compulsory copyright license to carry broadcast signal new requirement to assure the availability of navigation device such set top box from third party provider new universal service fund obligation on our provision of internet service that would add to the cost of that service increase in government administered broadband subsidy to rural area that could result in subsidized overbuilding of our more rural facility change to the fcc administration of spectrum and change in the regulatory framework for voip phone service including the scope of regulatory obligation associated with our voip service and our ability to interconnect our voip service with incumbent provider of traditional telecommunication service if any of these such law or regulation are enacted they could affect our operation and require significant expenditure we can not predict future development in these area and we are already subject to charter specific condition regarding certain internet practice result of the fcc approval in of the merger with twc and acquisition of bright house but any change to the regulatory framework for our video internet or voip service could have negative impact on our business and result of operation it remains uncertain what rule change if any will ultimately be adopted by congress and the fcc and what operating or financial impact any such rule might have on including on our programming agreement customer privacy and the user experience in addition the fcc the ftc and various state agency and attorney general actively investigate industry practice and could impose substantial forfeiture for alleged regulatory violation our cable system franchise are subject to non renewal or termination and are non exclusive the failure to renew franchise or the grant of additional franchise in one or more service area could adversely affect our business our cable system generally operate pursuant to franchise permit and similar authorization issued by state or local governmental authority controlling the public right of way many franchise establish comprehensive facility and service requirement well specific customer service standard and monetary penalty for non compliance in many case franchise are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with significant provision set forth in the franchise agreement governing system operation franchise are generally granted for fixed term and must be periodically renewed franchising authority may resist granting renewal if either past performance or the prospective operating proposal is considered inadequate franchise authority often demand concession or other commitment condition to renewal in some instance local franchise have not been renewed at expiration and we have operated and are operating under either temporary operating agreement or without franchise while negotiating renewal term with the local franchising authority we can not assure you that we will be able to comply with all significant provision of our franchise agreement and certain of our franchisers have from time to time alleged that we have not complied with these agreement additionally although historically we have renewed our franchise without incurring significant cost we can not assure you that we will be able to renew or to renew favorably our franchise in the future termination of or sustained failure to renew franchise in one or more service area could adversely affect our business in the affected geographic area our cable system franchise are non exclusive consequently local and state franchising authority can grant additional franchise to competitor in the same geographic area or operate their own cable system in some case local government entity and municipal utility may legally compete with on more favorable term tax legislation and administrative initiative or challenge to our tax and fee position could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition we operate cable system in location throughout the united state and result we are subject to the tax law and regulation of federal state and local government from time to time various legislative and or administrative initiative may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax position there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payment will not be adversely affected by these initiative certain state and locality have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional tax or fee on our service or changing the methodology or base on which certain fee and tax are computed potential change include additional tax or fee on our service which could impact our customer change to income tax sourcing rule and other change to general business tax central unit level assessment of property tax and other matter that could increase our income franchise sale use and or property tax liability for example some local franchising authority are seeking to impose franchise fee assessment on our broadband internet access service in addition to our video service and more may do so in the future if they do so and challenge to such assessment

agreement with verizon our spectrum mobile service is offered to customer subscribing to our internet service and run on verizon mobile network combined with spectrum wifi in the second quarter of we expanded our spectrum mobile bring your own device program across all sale channel to include broader set of device which we believe lower the cost for consumer of switching mobile carrier and reduces

life and increase profitability and cash flow over time result of growth cost associated with our new mobile product line we can not be certain that we will be able to grow revenue or maintain our margin at recent historical rate during the year ended december and our mobile product line increased revenue by million and million respectively reduced adjusted ebitda by approximately million and million respectively and reduced free cash flow by approximately billion and million respectively we continue to grow our mobile service and scale the business we expect continued negative impact to adjusted ebitda well negative working capital impact from the timing of device related cash flow when we sell the handset or tablet to customer pursuant to equipment installment plan the company

view programming installation processing fee or reconnection fee charged to customer to commence or reinstate service revenue from regional sport and news channel and commission related to the sale of merchandise by home shopping service critical accounting policy and estimate certain of our accounting policy require our management to make difficult subjective and or complex judgment management ha discussed these policy with the audit committee of charter board of director and the audit committee ha reviewed the following disclosure we consider the following policy to be the most critical in understanding the estimate assumption and judgment that are involved in preparing our financial statement and the uncertainty that could affect our result of operation financial condition and cash flow capitalization of labor and overhead cost valuation and impairment of franchise and goodwill income tax defined benefit pension planscapitalization of labor and overhead cost cost associated with network construction or upgrade placement of the customer drop to the dwelling and the placement of outlet within dwelling along with the cost associated with the deployment of new customer premise equipment necessary to provide video internet or voice service are capitalized cost capitalized include material direct labor and certain indirect cost these indirect cost are associated with the activity of personnel who assist in installation activity and consist of compensation and overhead cost associated with these support function while our capitalization is based on specific activity once capitalized we track these cost on composite basis by fixed asset category at the cable system level and not on specific asset basis for asset that are sold or retired we remove the estimated applicable cost and accumulated depreciation the cost of disconnecting service and removing customer premise equipment from dwelling and the cost to reconnect customer drop or to redeploy previously installed customer premise equipment are charged to operating expense incurred cost for repair and maintenance are charged to operating expense incurred while plant and equipment replacement including replacement of certain component betterment and replacement of cable drop and outlet are capitalized we make judgment regarding the installation and construction activity to be capitalized we capitalized direct labor and overhead of billion and billion respectively for the year ended december and we capitalize direct labor and overhead using standard developed from actual cost and applicable operational data we calculate standard annually or more frequently if circumstance dictate for item such the labor rate overhead rate and the actual amount of time required to perform capitalizable activity for example the standard amount of time required to perform capitalizable activity are based on study of the time required to perform such activity overhead rate are established based on an analysis of the nature of cost incurred in support of capitalizable activity and determination of the portion of cost that is directly attributable to capitalizable activity the impact of change that resulted from these study were not material in the period presented labor cost directly associated with capital project are capitalized capitalizable activity performed in connection with installation include such activity dispatching truck roll to the customer dwelling or business for service connection or placement of new equipment verification of serviceability to the customer dwelling or business determining whether the customer dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable network customer premise activity performed by in house field technician and third party contractor in connection with the installation replacement and betterment of equipment and material to enable video internet or voice service and verifying the integrity of the customer network connection by initiating test signal downstream from the headend to the customer premise equipment well testing signal level at the utility pole or pedestal judgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead cost incurred result from specific capital activity and therefore should be capitalized the primary cost that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are employee benefit and payroll tax associated with capitalized direct labor ii direct variable cost associated with capitalizable activity iii the cost of support personnel such care personnel and dispatcher who assist with capitalizable installation activity and iv indirect cost directly attributable to capitalizable activity while we believe our existing capitalization policy are appropriate significant change in the nature or extent of our operating practice could affect management judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policy and perform update to our internal study on an ongoing basis to determine whether fact or circumstance warrant change to our capitalization policy valuation and impairment of franchisesthe net carrying value of franchise of both december and wa approximately billion representing and of total asset respectively for more information and complete discussion of how we value and test franchise asset for impairment see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statement contained in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data we perform an impairment assessment of franchise asset annually or more frequently warranted by event or change in circumstance we performed qualitative assessment in our assessment included consideration of fair value appraisal performed for tax purpose in the beginning of of december valuation date the appraisal along with multitude of factor that affect the fair value of our franchise asset example of such factor include environmental and competitive change within our operating footprint actual and projected operating performance the consistency of our operating margin equity and debt market trend including change in our market capitalization and change in our regulatory and political landscape among other factor based on our assessment we concluded that it wa more likely than not that the estimated fair value of our franchise asset equal or exceeds their carrying value and that quantitative impairment test is not required valuation and impairment of goodwillthe net carrying value of goodwill of both december and wa approximately billion representing of total asset we have determined that we have one reporting unit for purpose of the assessment of goodwill impairment for more information and complete discussion on how we test goodwill for impairment see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statement contained in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data we perform our impairment assessment of goodwill annually of november with our franchise impairment testing we elected to perform qualitative assessment of goodwill in which included the appraisal and other factor described above based on the appraisal we determined that the fair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded the net asset carrying value of the reporting unit given the completion of the assessment and absence of significant adverse change in factor impacting our fair value estimate we concluded that it is more likely than not that our goodwill is not impaired income tax of december charter had approximately billion of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in gross deferred tax asset of approximately billion these loss resulted from the operation of charter holdco and it subsidiary and from loss carryforwards received result of the merger with twc in federal tax net operating loss carryforwards expire in the year through in addition of december charter had state tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in gross deferred tax asset net of federal tax benefit of approximately million state tax net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in the year through such tax loss carryforwards can accumulate and be used to offset charter future taxable income after december million of charter federal tax loss carryforwards are subject to section and other restriction pursuant to these restriction charter estimate that approximately million annually over each of the next four year of federal tax loss carryforwards should become unrestricted and available for charter use charter state tax loss carryforwards are subject to similar but varying restriction in assessing the realizability of deferred tax asset management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will be realized in evaluating the need for valuation allowance management take into account various factor including the expected level of future taxable income available tax planning strategy and reversal of existing taxable temporary difference approximately million of valuation allowance associated with federal capital loss carryforwards and approximately million of valuation allowance associated with state tax loss carryforwards and other miscellaneous deferred tax asset remains on the december consolidated balance sheet in determining our tax provision for financial reporting purpose we establish reserve for uncertain tax position unless such position are determined to be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination based on their technical merit in evaluating whether tax position ha met the more likely than not recognition threshold we presume the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that ha full knowledge of all relevant information tax position that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statement the tax position is measured the largest amount of benefit that ha greater than likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved there is considerable judgment involved in determining whether position taken on the tax return are more than not of being sustained we adjust our uncertain tax reserve estimate periodically because of ongoing examination by and settlement with the various taxing authority well change in tax law regulation and interpretation no tax year for charter are currently under examination by the irs for income tax purpose charter through tax year remain open for examination and assessment charter short period return dated may prior to the merger with twc and acquisition of bright house remain subject to examination and assessment year prior to remain open solely for purpose of examination of charter loss and credit carryforwards the irs is currently examining charter holding income tax return for charter holding through tax year remain open for examination and assessment the irs is currently examining twc income tax return for through twc tax year remains subject to examination and assessment prior to twc separation from time warner inc time warner in march twc wa included in the consolidated federal and certain state income tax return of time warner the irs ha examined time warner through income tax return and the result are under appeal we do not anticipate that these examination will have material impact on our consolidated financial position or result of operation in addition we are also subject to ongoing examination of our tax return by state and local tax authority for various period activity related to these state and local examination not have material impact on our consolidated financial position or result of operation during the year ended december do we anticipate material impact in the future defined benefit pension planswe sponsor three qualified defined benefit pension plan and one nonqualified defined benefit pension plan that provide pension benefit to majority of employee who were employed by twc before the merger with twc of december the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan asset wa billion and billion respectively and the net underfunded liability wa recorded million noncurrent asset million current liability and million long term liability of december the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan asset wa billion and billion respectively and the net underfunded liability wa recorded million noncurrent asset million current liability and million long term liability pension benefit are based on formula that reflect the employee year of service and compensation during their employment period actuarial gain or loss are change in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the fair value of plan asset resulting from experience different from that assumed or from change in assumption we have elected to follow mark to market pension accounting policy for recording the actuarial gain or loss annually during the fourth quarter or earlier if remeasurement event occurs during an interim period we use december measurement date for our pension plan we recognized net periodic pension cost of million and net periodic pension benefit of million in and respectively net periodic pension benefit or expense is determined using certain assumption including the expected long term rate of return on plan asset discount rate and mortality assumption we determined the discount rate used to compute pension expense based on the yield of large population of high quality corporate bond with cash flow sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future defined benefit payment in developing the expected long term rate of return on asset we considered the current pension portfolio composition past average rate of earnings and our asset allocation target we used discount rate of to determine the december pension plan benefit obligation decrease in the discount rate of basis point would result in million increase in our pension plan benefit obligation of december and net periodic pension expense recognized in under our mark to market accounting policy the expected long term rate of return on plan asset used to determine net periodic pension benefit for the year ended december is expected to be decrease in the expected long term rate of return of basis point to while holding all other assumption constant would result in an increase in our net periodic pension expense of approximately million see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statement contained

company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount then no further quantitative testing would be necessary quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment result in more likely than not determination or if qualitative assessment is not performed the quantitative assessment considers whether the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds it fair value in which case an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the reporting unit carrying value exceeds it fair value with the company franchise
