make additional investment in the design implementation and enforcement of new workplace health and safety protocol even if we follow what we believe to be best practice our effort to reopen our office safely may not be successful and could expose our employee partner and customer to health risk and to associated liability furthermore additional and or extended governmental restriction new regulation or other changing condition could cause to temporarily close certain office we have offered and plan to continue to offer significant percentage of our employee flexibility in the amount of time they work in an office which may adversely impact the productivity of certain employee and harm our business including our future operating result this may also present risk for our real estate portfolio and strategy and may present operational cybersecurity and workplace culture challenge that may adversely affect our business we have continued to host virtual only customer experience and we may deem it advisable to similarly alter postpone or cancel entirely additional customer employee or industry event in the future our virtual customer employee and industry event may not be

performance global and regional macroeconomic effect of the covid pandemic and related impact on our customer business operation and their demand for our product and service may persist for an indefinite period even after the covid pandemic ha subsided our operation have also been negatively affected by range of external factor related to the pandemic that are not within our control and covid case including the emergence and spread of more transmissible variant continue to surge in certain part of the world including the united state vaccine for covid continue to be administered in the united state and other country around the world but the extent and rate of vaccine adoption the long term efficacy of these vaccine and other factor remain uncertain authority throughout the world have implemented measure to contain or mitigate the spread of the virus including physical distancing travel ban and restriction closure of non essential business quarantine work from home directive mask requirement shelter in place order and vaccination program these measure have caused and are continuing to cause business slowdown or shutdown in affected area both regionally and worldwide which have impacted our business and result of operation may delay the provisioning of our offering and may impact our employee long the pandemic continues our employee will continue to be exposed to health risk and we could be negatively impacted in the future if significant number of our employee or employee who perform critical function become ill quarantine result of exposure to covid or not comply with vaccination program we continue to monitor the situation and public health guidance throughout the world we may adjust our current policy and practice and existing and new precautionary measure could negatively affect our operation of contentsthe extent of the impact from the pandemic depends on future development that can not be accurately predicted at this time such the duration and spread of the pandemic future wave of covid infection including the spread of variant or mutant strain resulting in additional preventive measure to contain or mitigate the spread of the virus the extent and effectiveness of containment action the administration adoption and efficacy of vaccination program and the impact of these and other factor on our employee customer partner and vendor if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such event effectively our business will be harmed finally to the extent that the pandemic harm our business and result of operation many of the other risk described in this risk factor section may be heightened our competitive position and result of operation could be harmed if we do not compete effectively the market for our product and service are characterized by intense competition new industry standard evolving distribution model limited barrier to entry disruptive technology development short product life cycle customer price sensitivity global market condition and frequent product introduction including alternative with limited functionality available at lower cost or free of charge any of these factor could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margin and could adversely affect our renewal and upsell and cross sell rate well our ability to attract new customer our future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and integrate our existing product and service introduce new product and service in timely and cost effective manner meet changing customer expectation and need extend our core technology into new application and anticipate emerging standard business model software delivery method and other technological development furthermore some of our competitor and potential competitor enjoy competitive advantage such greater financial technical sale marketing and other resource broader brand awareness and access to larger customer base result of these advantage potential and current customer might select the product and service of our competitor causing loss of our market share in addition consolidation ha occurred among some of our competitor further consolidation in these market may subject to increased competitive pressure and may harm our result of operation for additional information regarding our competition and the risk arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate see the section titled competition in part item of this report if we can not continue to develop acquire market and offer new product and service or enhancement to existing product and service that meet customer requirement our operating result could suffer the process of developing and acquiring new technology product and service and enhancing existing offering is complex costly and uncertain if we fail to anticipate customer rapidly changing need and expectation or adapt to emerging technological trend our market share and result of operation could suffer we must make long term investment develop acquire or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resource before knowing whether our prediction will accurately reflect customer demand for our product and service if we misjudge customer need in the future our new product and service may not succeed and our revenue and earnings may be harmed additionally any delay in the development acquisition marketing or launch of new offering or enhancement to an existing offering could result in customer attrition or impede our ability to attract new customer causing decline in our revenue earnings or stock price and weakening our competitive position consumer continue to migrate from personal computer to tablet and mobile device while we offer our product on variety of hardware platform if we can not continue adapting our product to tablet and mobile device or if our competitor can adapt their product more quickly than our business could be harmed release of new device or operating system may make it more difficult for our product to perform or may require significant cost to adapt our solution to such device or operating system these potential cost and delay could harm our business introduction of new technology could harm our business and result of operation the expectation and need of technology consumer are constantly evolving our future success depends on variety of factor including our continued ability to innovate introduce new product and service efficiently enhance and integrate our product and service in timely and cost effective manner extend our core technology into new application and anticipate emerging standard business model software delivery method and other technological development integration of our product and service with one another and other company offering creates an increasingly complex ecosystem that is partly reliant on third party if any disruptive technology or competing product service or operating system that are not compatible with our solution achieve widespread acceptance our operating result could suffer and our business could be harmed the introduction of or limitation on certain technology may reduce the effectiveness of our product for example some of our product rely on tracking third party cooky or other identifier to help our customer more effectively advertise of contentsand detect and prevent fraudulent activity consumer can control the use of these technology through their browser operating system device setting or ad blocking software or application increased use of such method software or application could harm our business we may not realize the anticipated benefit of past or future investment or acquisition and integration of acquisition may disrupt our business and management we may not realize the anticipated benefit of an investment or acquisition of company division product or technology each of which involves numerous risk these risk include inability to achieve the financial and strategic goal for the acquired and combined business difficulty in and the cost of effectively integrating the operation technology product or service and personnel of the acquired business entry into market in which we have minimal prior experience and where competitor in such market have stronger market position disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and other employee from other opportunity and challenge inability to retain personnel of the acquired business inability to retain key customer distributor vendor and other business partner of the acquired business inability to take advantage of anticipated tax benefit incurring acquisition related cost or amortization cost for acquired intangible asset that could impact our operating result elevated delinquency or bad debt write offs related to receivables of the acquired business we assume additional cost of bringing acquired company into compliance with law and regulation applicable to multinational corporation difficulty in maintaining control procedure and policy during the transition and integration impairment of our relationship with employee customer partner distributor or third party provider of our technology product or service failure of our due diligence process to identify significant problem liability or other challenge of an acquired company or technology exposure to litigation or other claim in connection with or inheritance of claim or litigation risk result of an acquisition such claim from terminated employee customer former stockholder or other third party incurring significant exit charge if product or service acquired in business combination are unsuccessful inability to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting are effective inability to obtain or obtain in timely manner approval from governmental authority which could delay or prevent such acquisition the failure of strategic investment to perform expected or to meet financial projection delay in customer and distributor purchasing decision due to uncertainty about the direction of our product and service offering increased account receivables collection time and working capital requirement associated with acquired business model and incompatibility of business culture of contentsmergers and acquisition of technology company are inherently risky if we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in timely manner we may not realize the benefit of the acquisition to the extent anticipated and in certain circumstance an acquisition could harm our financial position our ability to acquire other business or technology make strategic investment or integrate acquired business effectively may also be impaired by the effect of the covid pandemic government action in light of the pandemic trade tension and increased global scrutiny of foreign investment for example number of country including the united state and country in europe and the asia pacific region are considering or have adopted restriction on foreign investment government may continue to adopt or tighten restriction of this nature and such restriction could negatively impact our business and financial result the success of some of our product and service offering depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain customer of and contributor to our online marketplace for creative content the success of some of our product and service offering such adobe stock depends on our ability to continue to attract new customer and contributor to these online marketplace for creative content well our ability to continue to retain existing customer and contributor an increase in paying customer ha generally resulted in more content from contributor which increase the size of our collection and in turn attracts new paying customer we rely on the functionality and feature of our online marketplace the size and content of our collection and the effectiveness of our marketing effort to attract new customer and contributor and retain existing one new technology may render the feature of our online marketplace obsolete our collection may fail to grow anticipated or our marketing effort may be unsuccessful any of which may adversely affect our result of operation if our

loss or disclosure of data stored by adobe or our service provider may occur through physical break in breach of secure network by an unauthorized of contentsparty software vulnerability or coding error employee theft or misuse or other misconduct it is also possible that unauthorized access to or disclosure of employee or customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security control by customer or employee account created with weak or recycled password could allow cyber attacker to gain access to employee or customer data additionally failure by adobe or our customer to remove the account of their own employee or the granting of account in an uncontrolled manner may allow for access by former employee or other unauthorized individual if there were an inadvertent disclosure of customer data or unauthorized access to the data we posse on behalf of our customer our operation could be disrupted our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to claim or other liability regulatory investigation or fine in addition such perceived or actual unauthorized loss or disclosure of the information we collect process or store or breach of our security could damage our reputation result in the loss of customer and harm our business we rely on data center managed both by adobe and third party to host and deliver our service well access collect process use transmit and store data and any interruption or delay in these hosted service or failure in data collection or transmission could expose to liability and harm our business and reputation much of our business relies on hardware and service that are hosted managed and controlled directly by adobe or third party service provider including our online store at adobe com creative cloud document cloud and experience cloud solution we do not have redundancy for all of our system many of our critical application reside in only one of our data center and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventuality if our business relationship with third party provider of hosting or content delivery service is negatively affected or if one of our content delivery supplier were to terminate it agreement with without adequate notice we might not be able to deliver the corresponding hosted offering to our customer which could subject to reputational harm costly and time intensive notification requirement and cause to lose customer and future business in addition the covid pandemic ha disrupted and may continue to disrupt the supply chain of hardware needed to maintain these third party system and service or to run our business occasionally we migrate data among data center and to third party hosted environment if transition among data center or to third party service provider encounter unexpected interruption unforeseen complexity or unplanned disruption despite precaution undertaken during the process this may impair our delivery of product and service to customer and result in increased cost and liability which may harm our operating result reputation and our business it is also possible that hardware or software failure or error in our system or those of our third party service provider could result in data loss or corruption cause the information that we collect or maintain to be incomplete or contain inaccuracy that our customer regard significant or cause to fail to meet committed service level or comply with regulatory notification requirement furthermore our ability to collect and report data may be delayed or interrupted by number of factor including access to the internet the failure of our network or software system security breach or significant variability in visitor traffic on customer website in addition computer virus worm ransomware or other malware may harm our system causing to lose data and the transmission of computer virus or other malware could expose to litigation or regulatory investigation and costly and time intensive notification requirement we may also find on occasion that we can not deliver data and report to our customer in near real time of number of factor including significant spike in customer activity on their website or failure of our network or software or that of third party service provider if we fail to plan infrastructure capacity appropriately and expand it proportionally with the need of our customer base and we experience rapid and significant demand on the capacity of our data center or those of third party service outage or performance issue could occur which would impact our customer such strain on our infrastructure capacity could subject to regulatory and customer notification requirement violation of service level agreement commitment financial liability result in customer dissatisfaction or harm our business if we supply inaccurate information or experience interruption in our system our reputation could be harmed we could lose customer and we could be found liable for damage or incur other loss security vulnerability in our product and system or in our supply chain could lead to reduced revenue or to liability claim maintaining the security of our product and service is critical issue for and our customer security researcher criminal hacker and other third party regularly develop new technique to penetrate our end point information system and network security measure cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex making it increasingly difficult to detect and successfully defend them certain unauthorized party have in the past managed and may again in the future manage to gain access to and misuse some of our system and software or that of our third party service provider in order to access the authentication payment and personal information of our end user and employee in addition cyber attacker which may include individual or group well sophisticated group such nation state and state sponsored attacker which can deploy significant resource to plan and carry out exploit also develop and deploy virus worm credential stuffing attack tool and other malicious software program some of which may be specifically of contentsdesigned to attack our product service information system or network hardware software and operating system application that we develop or procure from third party have contained and may contain defect in design or manufacture including bug vulnerability and other problem that could unexpectedly compromise the security of the system or impair customer ability to operate or use our product the cost to prevent eliminate mitigate or alleviate cyber or other security problem bug virus worm malicious software program and security vulnerability are significant and our effort to address these problem including notifying affected party may not be successful or may be delayed and could result in interruption delay cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customer it is impossible to predict the extent frequency or impact these problem may have on outside party have in the past and may in the future attempt to fraudulently induce our employee or user of our product or service to disclose sensitive personal or confidential information via illegal electronic spamming phishing or other tactic this existing risk is compounded given the covid pandemic we shifted nearly all of our workforce to more frequent work from home arrangement we also expect to resume operation in our office under hybrid model where large portion of our workforce will spend portion of their time working in our office and portion of their time working from home unauthorized party may also attempt to gain physical access to our facility in order to infiltrate our information system or attempt to gain logical access to our product service or information system for the purpose of exfiltrating content and data these actual and potential breach of our security measure and the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unauthorized dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive personal or confidential data about our employee our customer or their end user including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data result of hacking fraud trickery or other form of deception could expose our employee our customer or the individual affected to risk of loss or misuse of this information this may result in litigation and liability or fine our compliance with costly and time intensive notice requirement governmental inquiry or oversight or loss of customer confidence any of which could harm our business or damage our brand and reputation thereby requiring time and resource to mitigate these impact these risk will likely increase we expand our hosted offering integrate our product and service and store and process more data including personal information these issue affect our product and service in particular because cyber attacker tend to focus their effort on popular offering with large user base and we expect them to continue to do so from time to time we have identified and in the future we may identify other vulnerability in some of our application and service and those of our third party service provider we devote significant resource to address security vulnerability through engineering more secure product enhancing security and reliability feature in our product and system code hardening conducting rigorous penetration test deploying update to address security vulnerability regularly reviewing our service provider security control reviewing and auditing our hosted service against independent security control framework such iso soc and pci providing resource such mandatory security training for our workforce and improving our incident response time but security vulnerability can not be totally eliminated the cost of these step could reduce our operating margin and we may be unable to implement these measure quickly enough to prevent cyber attacker from gaining unauthorized access into our system and product despite our preventative effort actual or perceived security vulnerability in our product and system may harm our reputation or lead to claim against and have in the past led to such claim and could lead some customer to stop using certain product or service to reduce or delay future purchase of product or service or to use competing product or service if we do not make the appropriate level of investment in our technology system or if our system become out of date or obsolete and we are not able to deliver the quality of data security our customer require or that meet our independent security control certification requirement our business could be adversely affected customer may also adopt security measure designed to protect their existing computer system from attack which could delay adoption of new technology moreover delayed sale lower margin or lost customer resulting from disruption caused by cyber attack preventative measure or failure to fully meet independent security control certification requirement could adversely affect our financial result stock price and reputation some of our enterprise offering have extended and complex sale cycle which can make our sale cycle unpredictable sale cycle for some of our enterprise offering including our adobe experience cloud and adobe experience platform solution and enterprise term license agreement etlas in our digital medium business are multi phased and complex the complexity in these sale cycle is due to several factor including the need for our sale representative to educate customer about the use and benefit of large scale deployment of our product and service including technical capability security feature potential cost saving and return on investment the desire of organization to undertake significant evaluation process to determine their technology requirement prior to making information technology expenditure of content the need for our representative to spend significant amount of time assisting potential customer in their testing and evaluation of our product and service intensifying competition within the industry the negotiation of large complex enterprise wide contract the need for our customer to obtain requisition approval from various decision maker within their organization due to the complexity of our solution touching multiple department within customer organization and customer budget constraint economic condition and unplanned administrative delay we spend substantial time and expense on our sale effort without assurance that potential customer will ultimately purchase our solution further restriction in place for the covid pandemic have resulted and could continue to result in our inability to negotiate in person even we return many employee to their office we target our sale effort at larger enterprise customer these trend are expected to continue and could have greater impact on our result of operation additionally our enterprise sale pattern ha historically been uneven where higher percentage of quarter total sale occur during the final week of each quarter which is common in our industry our extended sale cycle for these product and service make it difficult to predict when given sale cycle will close if our customer fail to renew subscription in accordance with our expectation our future revenue and operating result could suffer our adobe experience cloud creative cloud and document cloud offering typically involve subscription based offering pursuant to product and service agreement revenue from our subscription customer is generally recognized ratably over the term of their agreement which typically range from to month our customer have no obligation to renew their subscription for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period and customer may not renew their subscription at the same or higher level of service for the same number of seat or for the same duration of time if at all our varied customer base combined with the flexibility we offer in the length of our subscription based agreement complicates our ability to precisely forecast renewal rate therefore we can not provide assurance that we will be able to accurately predict future customer renewal rate our customer renewal rate may decline or fluctuate result of number of factor including their level of satisfaction with our service our ability to continue enhancing feature and functionality the reliability including uptime of our subscription offering the price of offering and those offered by our competitor the actual or perceived information security of our system and service decrease in the size of our customer base reduction in our customer spending level or decline in customer activity result of economic downturn or uncertainty in financial market including result of the covid pandemic which ha affected and may continue to affect certain sector of the economy disproportionately if our customer do not renew their subscription or if they renew on term le favorable to our revenue may decline we face various risk associated with our operating multinational corporation global business that generates approximately of our total revenue from sale to customer outside of the america we are subject to number of risk including foreign currency fluctuation and control international and regional economic political and labor condition including any instability or security concern abroad including uncertainty caused by the united kingdom exit from the european union brexit on january including the effect of the trade and cooperation agreement between the european union the european atomic energy community and the united kingdom signed on december well uncertainty caused by the evolving relation between the united state and china tax law including tax on foreign subsidiary increased financial accounting and reporting burden and complexity change in or imposition of legislative or regulatory requirement change in law governing the free flow of data across international border failure of law to protect our intellectual property right adequately of content inadequate local infrastructure and difficulty in managing and staffing international operation delay resulting from difficulty in obtaining export license for certain technology tariff quota and other trade barrier the imposition of governmental economic sanction on country in which we do business or where we plan to expand our business cost and delay associated with developing product in multiple language operating in location with higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practice and other factor beyond our control such terrorism war natural disaster climate change and pandemic including fluctuation in the severity and duration of the covid pandemic and resulting restriction on business activity which may vary significantly by region some of our third party business partner have international operation and are also subject to these risk and if our third party business partner are unable to appropriately manage these risk our business may be harmed if sale to any of our customer outside of the america are reduced delayed or canceled because of any of the factor our revenue may decline our business could be harmed if we fail to effectively manage critical strategic third party business relationship our offering expand and our customer base grows our relationship with strategic partner become increasingly valuable if our contractual relationship with these third party were to terminate or if we were unable to renew on favorable term our business could be harmed this is especially the case when the third party offering are integrated with our product and service or where the third party offering are difficult to substitute or replace alternative arrangement for such product and service may not be available to on commercially reasonable term and we may experience business interruption upon transition to an alternative partner the failure of third party to provide acceptable product and service or to update their technology including during the covid pandemic may result in disruption to our business operation and those of our customer which may reduce our revenue and profit cause to lose customer and damage our reputation we increasingly utilize the distribution platform of third party like apple app store and google play store for the distribution of certain of our product offering although we benefit from the strong brand recognition and large user base of these distribution platform to attract new customer the platform owner have wide discretion to change the pricing structure term of service and other policy with respect to and other developer and may offer or promote product that compete with our product offering adverse change by these third party could adversely affect our financial result failure of our third party customer service and technical support provider to adequately address customer request could harm our business and adversely affect our financial result our customer rely on our customer service support organization to resolve issue with our product and service we depend heavily on third party customer service and technical support representative working on our behalf to provide such service and we expect to continue to rely heavily on third party in the future this strategy present risk to our business since we may not be able to influence the quality of support directly we would be able to do if our own employee performed these activity our customer may react negatively to providing information to and receiving support from third party organization especially if these third party organization are based overseas if we encounter problem with our third party customer service and technical support provider our reputation may be harmed our ability to sell our offering could be adversely affected and we could lose customer and associated revenue if we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel our business may be harmed much of our future success depends on the continued service availability and performance of our senior management and highly skilled personnel across all level of our organization our senior management ha acquired specialized knowledge and skill with respect to our business and the loss of any of these individual could harm our business especially if we are not successful in developing adequate succession plan our effort to attract develop integrate and retain highly skilled employee with appropriate qualification may be compounded by intensified restriction on travel including during the covid pandemic immigration or the availability of work visa experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talent is intense and ha recently intensified further due to industry trend in many area where our employee are located we may experience higher compensation cost to retain senior management and experienced personnel that may not be offset by improved productivity or increased sale if we are unable to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel our business may be harmed of contentswe continue to hire personnel in country where exceptional technical knowledge and other expertise are offered at lower cost which increase the efficiency of our global workforce structure and reduces our personnel related expenditure nonetheless globalization continues competition for these employee in these country ha increased which may impact our ability to retain these employee and increase our expense resulting from competitive compensation we may continue to expand our international operation and international sale and marketing activity which would require significant management attention and resource we may be unable to scale our infrastructure effectively or quickly our competitor in these market and our revenue may not increase to offset these expected increase in cost and operating expense causing our result to suffer we believe that critical contributor to our success to date ha been our corporate culture which we have built to foster innovation teamwork and employee satisfaction we grow including from the integration of employee and business acquired in connection with previous or future acquisition we may find it difficult to maintain important aspect of our corporate culture which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success failure to manage our sale partner and distribution channel effectively could result in loss of revenue and harm to our business we contract with number of software distributor and other strategic partner none of which are individually responsible for material amount of our total net revenue for any recent period nonetheless if any single agreement with one of our distributor were terminated any prolonged delay in securing replacement distributor could have negative impact on our result of operation successfully managing our indirect distribution channel effort to reach various customer segment for our product and service is complex process across the broad range of geography where we do business or plan to do business our distributor and other channel partner are independent business that we do not control notwithstanding the independence of our channel partner we face legal risk and potential reputational harm from the activity of these third party including but not limited to export control violation workplace condition corruption and anti competitive behavior we can not be certain that our distribution channel will continue to market or sell our product and service effectively if our partner and distribution channel are not successful we may lose sale opportunity customer and revenue our distributor also sell our competitor product and service and if they favor our competitor product or service for any reason they may fail to market our product or service effectively or to devote resource necessary to provide effective sale which would cause our result to suffer we also distribute some product and service through our oem channel and if our oems decide not to bundle our application on their device our result could suffer in addition the financial health of our distributor and partner and our continuing relationship with them are important to our success some of these distributor and partner may be unable to withstand adverse change in economic condition which could result in insolvency the inability of such distributor and partner to obtain credit to finance access to or purchase of our product and service or delay in paying their obligation to we also sell some of our product and service through our direct sale force risk associated with this sale channel include more extended sale and collection cycle associated with direct sale effort challenge related to hiring retaining and motivating our direct sale force and substantial amount of ongoing training for sale representative moreover recent hire may not become productive we would like in most case it take significant period of time before they achieve full productivity our business could be seriously harmed if our expansion effort do not generate corresponding significant increase in revenue and we are unable to achieve the efficiency we anticipate in addition the loss of key sale employee could impact our customer relationship and future ability to sell to certain account covered by such employee risk related to law and regulationswe are subject to risk associated with compliance with law and regulation globally which may harm our business we are global company subject to varied and complex law regulation and custom both domestically and internationally these law and regulation relate to number of aspect of our business including trade protection import and export control anti boycott sanction and embargo data and transaction processing security payment card industry data security standard record management user generated content hosted on website we operate privacy practice data residency corporate governance anti trust and competition employee and third party complaint anti corruption gift policy conflict of interest security regulation and other regulatory requirement affecting trade and investment the application of these law and regulation to our business is often unclear and may at time conflict for example in many foreign country particularly in those with developing economy it is common to engage in business practice that are prohibited by regulation applicable to including the foreign corrupt practice act we can not provide assurance that our employee of contentscontractors agent and business partner will not take action in violation of our internal policy or law compliance with these law and regulation may involve significant cost or require change in our business practice that result in reduced revenue and profitability non compliance could also result in fine damage criminal sanction against our officer or our employee prohibition on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation in response to the covid pandemic federal state local and foreign governmental authority have imposed and may continue to impose protocol and restriction intended to contain the spread of the virus including limitation on the size of gathering closure of work facility school public building and business quarantine lockdown and travel restriction such restriction have disrupted and may continue to disrupt our business operation and limit our ability to perform critical function in addition approximately of our employee are located outside the united state accordingly we are exposed to change in law governing our employee relationship in various and foreign jurisdiction including law and regulation regarding wage and hour requirement fair labor standard employee data privacy unemployment tax rate worker compensation rate citizenship requirement and payroll and other tax which likely would have direct impact on our operating cost increasing regulatory focus on privacy and security issue and expanding law could impact our business model and expose to increased liability global company adobe is subject to global data protection privacy and security law regulation and code of conduct that apply to our various business unit and data processing activity these law regulation and code may be inconsistent across jurisdiction and are subject to evolving and differing sometimes conflicting interpretation government official and regulator privacy advocate and class action attorney are increasingly scrutinizing how company collect process use store share and transmit personal data this increased scrutiny may result in new interpretation of existing law thereby further impacting adobe business globally law such the general data protection regulation gdpr in europe and the personal information protection law pipl in china and new and emerging state law in the united state on privacy data and related technology such the california consumer privacy act the california privacy right act and the virginia consumer data protection act well industry self regulatory code create new compliance obligation and expand the scope of potential liability either jointly or severally with our customer and supplier while we have invested in readiness to comply with applicable requirement the dynamic nature of these law regulation and code well their interpretation by regulator and court may affect our ability and our enterprise customer ability to reach current and prospective customer to respond to both enterprise and individual customer request under the law such individual right of access correction and deletion of their personal information and to implement our business model effectively these law regulation and code may also impact our innovation and business driver in developing new and emerging technology artificial intelligence and machine learning these requirement among others may impact demand for our offering and force to bear the burden of more onerous obligation in our contract any perception of our practice product or service violation of individual privacy or data protection right may subject to public criticism class action lawsuit reputational harm or investigation or claim by regulator industry group or other third party all of which could disrupt or adversely impact our business and expose to increased liability additionally we collect and store information on behalf of our business customer and if our customer fail to comply with contractual obligation or applicable law it could result in litigation or reputational harm to transferring personal information across international border is complex and subject to legal and regulatory requirement well active litigation and enforcement in number of jurisdiction around the world each of which could have an adverse impact to our ability to process and transfer personal data part of our business operation for example european data transfer outside the european economic area are highly regulated and litigated the mechanism that we and many other company rely upon for european data transfer privacy shield and model clause are the subject of judicial decision by the court of justice of the european union

result of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statement and note thereto discussion regarding our financial condition and result of operation for fiscal compared to fiscal is included in item of our annual report on form for the fiscal year ended november filed with the sec on january critical accounting policy and estimatesin preparing our consolidated financial statement in accordance with gaap and pursuant to the rule and regulation of the sec we make assumption judgment and estimate that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent asset and liability we base our assumption judgment and estimate on historical experience and various other factor that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance actual result could differ materially from these estimate under different assumption or condition we evaluate our assumption judgment and estimate on regular basis we also discus our critical accounting policy and estimate with the audit committee of the board of director we believe that the assumption judgment and estimate involved in the accounting for revenue recognition business combination and income tax have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statement these area are key component of our result of operation and are based on complex rule requiring to make judgment and estimate and consequently we consider these to be our critical accounting policy historically our assumption judgment and estimate relative to our critical accounting policy have not differed materially from actual result revenue recognition our contract with customer may include multiple good and service for example some of our offering include both on premise and or on device software license and cloud service determining whether the software license and the cloud service are distinct from each other and therefore performance obligation to be accounted for separately or not distinct from each other and therefore part of single performance obligation may require significant judgment we have concluded that the on premise on device software license and cloud service provided in our creative cloud and document cloud subscription offering are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud service are provided in reaching this conclusion we considered the nature of our promise to creative cloud and document cloud customer which is to provide complete end to end creative design or document workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple device and team we fulfill this promise by providing access to solution that integrates cloud based and on premise on device feature that together through their integration provide functionality utility and workflow efficiency that could not

awareness natural language processing optical character recognition and automated document tagging business combinationswe allocate the purchase price of acquired company to tangible and intangible asset acquired and liability assumed based upon their estimated fair value at the acquisition date the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimate and assumption with respect to intangible asset and deferred revenue obligation although we believe the assumption and estimate we have made are reasonable they are based in part on historical experience market condition and information obtained from management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain example of critical estimate in valuing certain of the intangible asset we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flow from software license sale subscription support agreement consulting contract and acquired developed technology and patent expected cost to develop acquired technology and patent internally into commercially viable product of content historical and expected customer attrition rate and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customer the acquired company trade name and trademark well assumption about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in the combined company product portfolio the expected use of the acquired asset and discount rate in connection with the purchase price allocation for our acquisition we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligation assumed the estimated fair value of these obligation is determined utilizing cost build up approach the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the cost related to fulfilling the obligation plus normal profit margin unanticipated event and circumstance may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumption estimate or actual result accounting for income taxeswe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income tax under this method income tax expense is recognized for the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year in addition deferred tax asset and liability are recognized for the expected future tax consequence of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards management must make assumption judgment and estimate to determine our current provision for income tax and also our deferred tax asset and liability our assumption judgment and estimate relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax law our interpretation of current tax law and possible outcome of current and future audit conducted by foreign and domestic tax authority we have established reserve for income tax to address potential exposure involving tax position that could be challenged by tax authority in
