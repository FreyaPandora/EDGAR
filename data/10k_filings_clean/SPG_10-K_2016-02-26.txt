material may also affect our actual result we may update these factor in our future periodic report risk relating to retail operation overall economic and market condition may adversely affect the general retail environment our concentration in the retail real estate market mean that we are subject to number of factor that could adversely affect the retail environment generally including without limitation change in international national regional and local economic condition local real estate condition such an oversupply of or reduction in demand for retail space or retail good decrease in rental rate declining real estate value and the availability and creditworthiness of tenant level of consumer spending change in consumer confidence and fluctuation in seasonal spending the willingness of retailer to lease space in our property tenant bankruptcy and resulting rejection of our lease the impact on our retail tenant and demand for retail space at our property from the increasing use of the internet by retailer and consumer perception by consumer of the safety convenience and attractiveness of our property increased operating cost change in applicable law and regulation including tax environmental safety and zoning casualty and other natural disaster and the potential for terrorist activity we derive our operating result primarily from retail tenant many of have been and continue to be under degree of economic stress significant deterioration in the creditworthiness of our retail tenant could have material adverse effect on we may not be able to lease newly developed property and renew lease and relet space at existing property we may not be able to lease new property to an appropriate mix of tenant also lease for our existing property expire the premise may not be relet or the term of reletting including the cost of allowance and concession to tenant may be le favorable than the current lease term to the extent that our leasing goal are not achieved we could be materially and adversely affected some of our property depend on anchor store or other major tenant to attract shopper and could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more of these anchor store or major tenant our property are typically anchored by department store and other large nationally recognized tenant the value of some of our property could be materially and adversely affected if these anchor or other major tenant fail to comply with their contractual obligation or cease their operation for example among department store and other large store often referred to big box store corporate merger activity typically result in the closure of duplicate or geographically overlapping store location further sustained adverse pressure on the result of our department store and major tenant may have similarly sustained adverse impact upon our own result certain department store and other national retailer have experienced and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future given current macroeconomic uncertainty and le than desirable level of consumer table of content confidence considerable decrease in customer traffic in their retail store increased competition from alternative retail option such those accessible via the internet and other form of pressure on their business model pressure on these department store and national retailer increase their ability to maintain their store meet their obligation both to and to their external lender and supplier withstand takeover attempt by investor or rival or avoid bankruptcy and or liquidation may be impaired and result in closure of their store or their seeking of lease modification with any lease modification could be unfavorable to the lessor and could decrease rent or expense recovery charge other tenant may be entitled to modify the economic or other term of or terminate their existing lease with in the event of such closure if department store or major tenant were to close it store at our property we may experience difficulty and delay and incur significant expense in replacing the tenant well in leasing space in area adjacent to the vacant department store or major tenant at attractive rate or at all additionally department store or major tenant closure may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sale at our property if the sale of store operating in our property were to decline significantly due to the closing of anchor store or other national retailer adverse economic condition or other reason tenant may be unable to pay their minimum rent or expense recovery charge in the event of any default by tenant we may not be able to fully recover and or may experience delay and cost in enforcing our right landlord to recover amount due to under the term of our agreement with such party we face potential adverse effect from tenant bankruptcy bankruptcy filing by retailer can occur regularly in the course of our operation if tenant file for bankruptcy the tenant may have the right to reject and terminate one or more of it lease with and we can not be sure that it will affirm one or more of it lease and continue to make rental payment to in timely manner bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenant would bar all effort by to collect pre bankruptcy debt from that tenant or from their property unless we receive an order permitting to do so from the bankruptcy court in addition we can not evict tenant solely because of it bankruptcy if lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy all pre bankruptcy balance due under the lease must be paid to in full however if lease is rejected by tenant in bankruptcy we would have general unsecured claim for damage in connection with such balance if bankrupt tenant vacates space it might not do so in timely manner and we might be unable to lease the vacated space during that time at attractive rate or at all furthermore we may be required to incur significant expense in replacing the bankrupt tenant any unsecured claim we hold bankrupt tenant might be paid only to the extent that fund are available and only in the percentage is paid to all other holder of unsecured claim and there are restriction under bankruptcy law that limit the amount of the claim we can make if lease is rejected result it is likely that we would recover substantially le than the full value of any unsecured claim we hold we continually seek to re lease vacant space resulting from tenant termination the bankruptcy of tenant particularly an anchor tenant or national tenant with multiple location may make the re leasing of their space difficult and costly and it also may be more difficult to lease the remainder of the space at the affected property future tenant bankruptcy may impact our ability to successfully execute our re leasing strategy and could materially and adversely affect we face wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably our property compete with other retail property and other form of retailing such catalog and commerce website competition may come from mall outlet center community lifestyle center and other shopping center both existing well future development and redevelopment expansion project well catalog and commerce the presence of competitive alternative affect our ability to lease space and the level of rent we can obtain new construction renovation and expansion at competing site could also negatively affect our property we also compete with other major real estate investor and developer for attractive investment opportunity and prime development site competition for the acquisition of existing property and development site may result in increased purchase price and may adversely affect our ability to make attractive investment on favorable term or at all in addition we compete with other retail property company for tenant and qualified management risk relating to real estate investment and operation we face risk associated with the acquisition development redevelopment and expansion of property we regularly acquire and develop new property and redevelop and expand existing property and these activity are subject to various risk we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition development or redevelopment expansion opportunity in addition newly acquired developed or redeveloped expanded property may not perform well table of content expected impacting our anticipated return on investment we are subject to other risk in connection with any acquisition development and redevelopment expansion activity including the following acquisition or construction cost of project may be higher than projected potentially making the project unfeasible or unprofitable development or redevelopment may take considerably longer than expected delaying the commencement and amount of income from the property we may not be able to obtain financing or to refinance loan on favorable term or at all we may be unable to obtain zoning occupancy or other governmental approval occupancy rate and rent may not meet our projection and the project may not be profitable and we may need the consent of third party such department store anchor tenant mortgage lender and joint venture partner and those consent may be withheld if development or redevelopment expansion project is unsuccessful either because it is not meeting our expectation when operational or wa not completed according to the project planning we could lose our investment in the project further if we guarantee the property financing our loss could exceed our investment in the project real estate investment are relatively illiquid our property represent substantial portion of our total consolidated asset these investment are relatively illiquid result our ability to sell one or more of our property or investment in real estate in response to any change in economic industry or other condition may be limited the real estate market is affected by many factor such general economic condition availability and term of financing interest rate and other factor including supply and demand for space that are beyond our control if we want to sell property we can not assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or at all or that the sale price of property will be attractive at the relevant time or even exceed the carrying value of our investment moreover if property is mortgaged we may not be able to obtain release of the lien on that property without the payment of the associated debt and or substantial prepayment penalty which could restrict our ability to dispose of the property even though the sale might otherwise be desirable our international activity may subject to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operation of december we held interest in joint venture property that operate in austria italy japan malaysia mexico the netherlands south korea canada and the united kingdom we also have an equity stake in klépierre publicly traded european real estate company which operates in country in europe accordingly our operating result and the value of our international operation may be impacted by any unhedged movement in the foreign currency in which those operation transact and in which our net investment in the international operation is held we may pursue additional investment development and redevelopment expansion opportunity outside the united state international investment ownership development and redevelopment expansion activity carry risk that are different from those we face with our domestic property and operation these risk include but are not limited to adverse effect of change in exchange rate for foreign currency change in foreign political and economic environment regionally nationally and locally challenge of complying with wide variety of

international operation difficulty in managing international operation and obstacle to the repatriation of earnings and cash our international activity represented approximately of our net operating income or noi for the year ended december to the extent that we expand our international activity the above risk could increase in significance which in turn could have material adverse effect on table of content risk relating to debt and the financial market we have substantial debt burden that could affect our future operation of december our consolidated mortgage and unsecured indebtedness excluding related premium and discount totaled billion result of this indebtedness we are required to use substantial portion of our cash flow for debt service including selected repayment at scheduled maturity which limit our ability to use those cash flow to fund the growth of our business we are also subject to the risk normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow from operation will be insufficient to meet required debt service or that we will be able to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable term or at all our debt service cost generally will not be reduced if development at the applicable property such the entry of new competitor or the loss of major tenant cause reduction in the income from the property our indebtedness could also have other adverse consequence on including reducing our access to capital or increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic industry and market condition in addition if property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in loss of income and decline in our total asset value if any of the foregoing occurs we could be materially and adversely affected disruption in the capital and credit market may adversely affect our ability to access external financing for our growth and ongoing debt service requirement we depend on external financing principally debt financing to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturity of our outstanding debt our access to financing depends on the willingness of lending institution and other debt investor to grant credit to and condition in the capital market in general an economic recession may cause extreme volatility and disruption in the capital and credit market we rely upon the credit facility source of funding for numerous transaction our access to these fund is dependent upon the ability of each of the participant to the credit facility to meet their funding commitment to when market are volatile access to capital and credit market could be disrupted over an extended period of time and one or more financial institution may not have the available capital to meet their previous commitment to the failure of one or more participant to the credit facility to meet their funding commitment to could have material adverse effect on including result of making it difficult to obtain the financing we may need for future growth and or meeting our debt service requirement we can not assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for the future growth of our business or to meet our debt service requirement or that sufficient amount of financing will be available to on favorable term or at all adverse change in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing term the operating partnership outstanding senior unsecured note credit facility the commercial paper program and simon preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agency the credit rating are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratio financial condition and prospect and other factor viewed by the credit rating agency relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in general our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we can access well the term of any financing we obtain since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund the growth of our business an adverse change in our credit rating including actual change and change in outlook or even the initiation of review of our credit rating that could result in an adverse change could have material adverse effect on the agreement that govern our indebtedness contain various covenant that impose restriction on that might affect our ability to operate freely we have variety of unsecured debt including the credit facility and secured property

substantially all of our asset and engage in merger and certain acquisition in addition certain of the agreement that govern our indebtedness contain financial covenant that require to maintain certain financial ratio including certain coverage ratio these covenant may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiative or certain transaction that might otherwise be advantageous to in addition our ability to comply with these provision might be affected by event beyond our control failure to comply with any of our financing covenant could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate the related indebtedness well other of our indebtedness which could have material adverse effect on table of content our hedging interest rate protection arrangement may not effectively limit our interest rate risk we selectively manage our exposure to interest rate risk by combination of interest rate protection agreement to effectively fix or cap all or portion of our variable rate debt in addition we refinance fixed rate debt at time when we believe rate and other term are appropriate our effort to manage these exposure may not be successful our use of interest rate hedging arrangement to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose to additional risk including risk that counterparty to hedging arrangement may fail to honor it obligation or that we could be required to fund our contractual payment obligation under such arrangement in relatively large amount or on short notice developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate from risk associated with interest rate fluctuation there can be no assurance that our hedging activity will have the desired beneficial impact on our result of operation liquidity or financial condition termination of these hedging agreement typically involves cost such transaction fee or breakage cost risk relating to income tax we

expense recorded and paid during those period table of content we make estimate part of our valuation of the purchase price of acquisition including the component of excess investment in joint venture to the various component of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component the most significant component of our valuation are typically the determination of fair value to the building if vacant land and market value of in place lease in the case of the fair value of building and fair value of land and other intangible our estimate of the value of these component will affect the amount of depreciation we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of the market value of in place lease we make our best estimate of the tenant ability to pay rent based upon the tenant operating performance at the property including the competitive position of the property in it market well sale psf rent psf and overall occupancy cost for
