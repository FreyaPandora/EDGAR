institution should be regulated these framework and recommendation address such issue systemic financial risk financial group supervision capital and solvency standard corporate governance including compensation and number of related issue associated with response to the financial crisis the iais represents insurance regulator and supervisor of more than jurisdiction including region and state in nearly country and seek to promote globally consistent insurance industry supervision the iais itself is not regulator but one of it activity is to develop insurance regulatory standard for use by local authority across the globe the fsb ha charged the iais with developing framework for measuring systemic risk posed by insurance group and ha directed the iais to create standard relative to many of the area of focus of the fsb which go beyond the iais basic insurance core principle the iais is developing comframe common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance group iaigs comframe set out qualitative and quantitative standard in order to assist supervisor in collectively addressing an iaig activity and risk identifying and avoiding regulatory gap and coordinating supervisory activity comframe is expected to include standard for group supervision governance and internal control enterprise risk management and recovery and resolution planning also in connection with comframe the iais is in the process of developing risk based global insurance capital standard ic applicable to iaigs we currently meet the parameter set forth to define an iaig comframe standard are expected to be finalized in following completion of field testing in the iais will put forward ic version for implementation in implementation of ic version will consist of two phase five year monitoring phase in which ic version will be used for confidential reporting to group wide supervisor and discussion in supervisory college and an implementation phase whereby the ic will be applied group wide prescribed capital requirement at which point result will be used the basis for supervisory action confidential reporting of ic version will include reporting by iaigs of standard formula based on market adjusted valuation and the option at the discretion of the group wide supervisor of additional ic reporting based on gaap with adjustment and or an internal model based calculation in recognition of federal reserve and naic plan to develop an aggregation method for group capital the iais ha agreed to aid in the development of and collect data from jurisdiction that are party to the aggregation method although the aggregation method will not be part of ic version the iais aim to be in position at the end of the monitoring phase to determine whether the aggregated approach provides substantially the outcome the ic in which case it could be incorporated into the ic an outcome equivalent approach in february the iais announced the adoption of three year systemic risk assessment and policy workplan due to be finalized by year end this initiative is comprised of new macroprudential activity based approach aba to regulating systemic risk which will be developed in conjunction with the iais previously announced work in finalizing comframe including the ic well any improvement to the methodology for identifying global systemically important insurer siis based on the iais sii assessment methodology since july the fsb ha published an annual list of siis which ha included however on november the fsb announced that it would not be proceeding with the publication of sii list for in light of the iais development of the aba and it implication for the assessment of systemic risk in insurance and by extension the identification of siis and related policy measure for siis on november the fsb announced that in light of iais progress in developing proposed holistic framework for the assessment and mitigation of potential systemic risk in the insurance sector inclusive of the aba key component of the framework it ha decided not to engage in an identification of siis in in it public consultation on the holistic framework issued on november the iais noted that in it view the implementation of the holistic framework would obviate the need for the fsb annual sii identification process the fsb stated that it will ass the iais recommendation to suspend sii identification from once the holistic framework is finalized in november and ii in november based on the initial year of implementation of the holistic framework review the need to either discontinue or re establish an annual identification of siis the standard issued by the fsb and or the iais are not binding on the united state or other jurisdiction around the world unless and until the appropriate local governmental body or regulator adopt law and regulation implementing such standard at this aig form table of content item business time it is not known how the iais framework and or standard might be implemented in the united state and other jurisdiction around the world or how they might apply to brexit on june the uk held referendum in which majority voted for the uk to withdraw it membership in the eu commonly referred to brexit the term of withdrawal remain uncertain with the draft withdrawal agreement to date been rejected by the uk parliament there can be no assurance that withdrawal agreement will be reached prior to brexit aig ha significant operation and employee in the uk and other eu member state prior to december our general insurance business operated through aig europe limited ael uk incorporated insurer with branch across the eea these branch operated through the eu concept of freedom of establishment which allows an insurer in any member state to establish branch operation in any other member state but with single capital pool and single prudential regulator which in this case wa the uk prudential regulation authority ael wa uk authorized in addition the various establishment of ael were able to sell insurance product across border into other member state under the eu principle of freedom of service in the event that the uk leaf the eu without withdrawal agreement in place or in the event that withdrawal agreement doe not preserve access to these eu freedom for uk insurer ael would be severely constrained in it ability to utilize and benefit from such freedom uk government policy ha not been to pursue continued uk membership of the eu single market and so even if the uk and eu are able to settle on withdrawal agreement it is unlikely that ael structure would have remained efficient beyond any proposed temporary transitional period result in order to adapt to and be prepared ahead of brexit on december we completed reorganization of our operation and legal entity structure in the uk and the eu through the establishment of new european subsidiary in luxembourg aig europe aesa which ha branch across the eea and switzerland and new uk subsidiary american international group uk limited aig uk business written by ael branch in the remaining eea country wa transferred to aesa along with business previously written on freedom of service basis from ael uk operation the remaining business written by ael uk operation wa transferred to aig uk and ael wa merged into aesa allowing aig to operate in the eea and uk on standalone basis this reorganization address the uncertainty for uk insurer generated by brexit because it ensures that even in the event that no agreement is reached between the uk and eu in this sector aig will be able to continue to service and pay claim on existing policy and write new and renewal business where the insured risk is located in the remaining eea country aig continues to monitor adapt to and prepare for other risk relating to no deal brexit that could impact it business including for example the effect on the wider uk and eu economy and on investment legislative change update to policy wording that may become necessary and other specific area such the issuance of additional documentation to motorist it insures travel cross border derivative regulation of and restriction on derivative market and transaction have been proposed or adopted outside the united state for instance the eu ha also established set of new regulatory requirement for

should carefully consider the following risk factor any of these risk factor could have significant or material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition or liquidity they could also cause significant fluctuation and volatility in the trading price of our security reader should not consider any description of these factor to be complete set of all potential risk that could affect aig these factor should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and the other report and material filed by with the security and exchange commission sec further many of these risk are interrelated and could occur under similar business and economic condition and the occurrence of certain of them may in turn cause the emergence or exacerbate the effect of others such combination could materially increase the severity of the impact of these risk on our business result of operation financial condition and liquidity market condition deterioration of economic condition geopolitical tension or weakening in global capital market may materially affect our business result of operation financial condition and liquidity our business are highly dependent on global economic and market condition weakness in economic condition and the capital market and market volatility have in the past led and may in the future lead to poor operating environment erosion of consumer and investor confidence reduced business volume deteriorating liquidity and decline in asset valuation adverse economic condition may result from global economic and political development including plateauing business activity and inflationary pressure in developed economy uncertainty surrounding china ability to successfully maintain growth the effect of brexit defined below on business investment hiring migration and labor supply and intensifying trade protectionism these and other market economic and political factor could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and liquidity in many way including lower level of consumer and commercial business activity that could decrease revenue and profitability and decrease value in goodwill deferred tax asset and other long term asset ii increase in credit spread and default that could reduce investment asset valuation increase credit loss across numerous asset class and increase statutory capital requirement and iii increased market volatility and uncertainty that could decrease liquidity and increase borrowing cost other way in which we could be negatively affected by economic condition include but are not limited to increase in policy surrender and cancellation write offs of deferred policy acquisition cost increase in liability for future policy benefit due to loss recognition on certain long duration insurance and reinsurance contract and increase in expense associated with third party reinsurance or decreased ability to obtain reinsurance at acceptable term sustained low interest rate or rapidly increasing interest rate may materially and adversely affect our profitability although interest rate have been rising recently particularly in the united state rate remain low relative to historical level sustained low interest rate can negatively affect the performance of our investment security and reduce the level of investment income earned on our investment portfolio if low interest rate environment persists we may experience lower investment income due to practical and capital market limitation we may not be able to fully mitigate our interest rate risk by matching exposure of our asset relative to our liability continued low interest rate could also impair our ability to earn the return assumed in the pricing and the reserving for our product at the time they were sold and issued change in interest rate may be correlated with inflation trend which would impact our loss trend on the other hand in period of rapidly increasing interest rate we may not be able to replace in timely manner the investment in our general account with higher yielding investment needed to fund the higher crediting rate necessary to keep interest rate sensitive product competitive therefore we may have to accept lower investment spread and thus lower profitability or face decline in sale and greater loss of existing contract and related asset in addition policy loan surrender and withdrawal tend to increase policyholder seek investment with higher perceived return interest rate rise this process may result in cash outflow requiring that we sell investment at time when the price of those investment are adversely affected by the increase in interest rate this may result in realized investment loss an increase in interest rate could also have material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio for example by decreasing the estimated fair value of the fixed income security that comprise substantial portion of our investment portfolio this in turn could adversely affect our ability to realize our deferred tax asset reserve and exposure insurance and reinsurance liability are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserve for loss and loss expense we regularly review the adequacy of the established loss reserve and conduct extensive analysis of our reserve during the year our loss reserve however may develop adversely and materially impact our business result of operation financial condition and liquidity aig form table of content item risk factor for general insurance estimation of ultimate net loss loss expense and loss reserve is complex process particularly for long tail liability line of business these line include but are not limited to general liability commercial automobile liability environmental worker compensation excess casualty and crisis management coverage insurance and risk management program for large corporate customer and other customized structured insurance product well excess and umbrella liability error and omission product liability program and specialty there is also greater uncertainty in establishing reserve with respect to new business particularly new business that is generated with respect to more recently introduced product line in these case there is le historical experience or knowledge and le data upon which the actuary can rely estimating reserve is further complicated by unexpected claim or unintended coverage that emerge due to changing condition these emerging issue may increase the size or number of claim beyond our underwriting intent and may not become apparent for many year after policy is issued while we use number of analytical reserve development technique to project future loss development reserve have been and may be significantly affected by change in loss cost trend or loss development factor that were relied upon in setting the reserve for example in and we recorded pre tax net charge of billion billion and billion respectively to strengthen our general insurance loss reserve reflecting adverse development in class of business with long reporting tail primarily in casualty and financial line these change in loss cost trend or loss development factor could be due to change in actual versus expected claim and loss difficulty in predicting change such change in inflation unemployment duration or other social or economic factor affecting claim including judicial and legislative approach any deviation in loss cost trend or in loss development factor might not be identified for an extended period of time after we record the initial loss reserve estimate for any accident year or number of year for life and retirement experience may develop adversely such that additional reserve must be established adverse experience could arise out of severe short term event such pandemic or due to misestimation of long term assumption such mortality improvement and interest rate assumption while mortality experience is relatively stable due to the large amount of historical data available assumption in respect of other variable such policyholder behavior can be more difficult to estimate and may have significant impact on reserve life and retirement reserve and assumption are reviewed regularly and loss recognition testing and cash flow testing is carried out annually for further discussion of our loss reserve see item md critical accounting estimate insurance liability loss reserve and insurance reserve loss reserve and note to the consolidated financial statement our consolidated result of operation liquidity financial condition and rating are subject to the effect of natural and man made catastrophic event event such hurricane windstorm flooding earthquake wildfire solar storm war or other military action act of terrorism explosion and fire cyber crime product defect pandemic and other highly contagious disease mass tort and other catastrophe have adversely affected our business in the past and could do so in the future for example we had pre tax catastrophe loss of billion in which included loss from hurricane florence and michael typhoon and earthquake in japan and mudslide and wildfire in california in addition we recognize the scientific consensus that climate change is reality of increasing concern indicated by higher concentration of greenhouse gas warming atmosphere and ocean diminished snow and ice and sea level rise we understand that climate change potentially pose serious financial threat to society whole with implication for the insurance industry in area such catastrophe risk perception pricing and modeling assumption particularly if the frequency and severity of natural catastrophic event continue to increase because there is significant variability associated with the impact of climate change we can not predict how physical legal regulatory and social response may impact our business catastrophic event and any relevant regulation could expose to widespread claim cost associated with property worker compensation business interruption and mortality and morbidity claim loss resulting from decline in the value of our invested asset limitation on our ability to recover deferred tax asset loss resulting from actual policy experience that is adverse compared to the assumption made in product pricing decline in value and or loss with respect to company and other entity whose security we hold and counterparties we transact business with and have credit exposure to including reinsurers and decline in the value of investment and significant disruption to our physical infrastructure system and operation natural and man made catastrophic event are generally unpredictable our exposure to catastrophic related loss depends on various factor including the frequency and severity of the catastrophe the rate of inflation and the value and geographic or other concentration of insured company and individual vendor model and proprietary assumption and process that we use to manage catastrophe exposure may prove to be ineffective due to incorrect assumption or estimate aig form table of content item risk factor in addition legislative and regulatory initiative and court decision following major catastrophe could require to pay the insured beyond the provision of the original insurance policy and may prohibit the application of deductible resulting in inflated catastrophe claim for further detail on potential catastrophic event including sensitivity analysis of our exposure to certain catastrophe see item md enterprise risk management insurance risk reinsurance may not be available or affordable and may not be adequate to protect loss our subsidiary are major purchaser of third party reinsurance and we use reinsurance part of our overall risk management strategy our reinsurance business also purchase retrocessional reinsurance which allows reinsurer to cede to another company all or part of the reinsurance obligation originally assumed by the reinsurer while reinsurance doe not discharge our subsidiary from their obligation to pay claim for loss insured or reinsured under our policy it doe make the reinsurer liable to the subsidiary for the reinsured portion of the risk for this reason reinsurance is an important tool to manage transaction and insurance line risk retention and to mitigate loss from catastrophe market condition beyond our control may impact the availability and cost of reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance and could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition for example reinsurance may be more difficult or costly to obtain after year with large number of major catastrophe we may at certain time be forced to incur additional cost for reinsurance or may be unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable term in the latter case we would have to accept an increase in exposure to risk reduce the amount of business written by our subsidiary or seek alternative in line with our risk limit additionally we are exposed to credit risk with respect to our subsidiary reinsurers to the extent the reinsurance receivable is not secured by collateral or doe not benefit from other credit enhancement we also bear the risk that reinsurer may be unwilling to pay amount we have recorded reinsurance recoverables for any reason including that the term of the reinsurance contract do not reflect the intent of the party to the contract or there is disagreement between the party to their intent ii the term of the contract can not be legally enforced iii the term of the contract are interpreted by court or arbitration panel differently than expected iv the reinsurance transaction performs differently than we anticipated due to flawed design of the reinsurance structure term or condition or change in law and regulation or in the interpretation of the law and regulation materially impact reinsurance transaction the insolvency of one or more of our reinsurers or inability or unwillingness to make timely payment under the term of our contract could have material adverse effect on our result of operation and liquidity additionally the use of reinsurance placed in the capital market may not provide the same level of protection traditional reinsurance transaction any disruption volatility and uncertainty in these market such following major catastrophic event may limit our ability to access such market on term favorable to or at all also to the extent that we intend to use structure based on an industry loss index or other non indemnity trigger rather than on actual loss incurred by we could be subject to residual risk we currently have limited reinsurance coverage for terrorist attack further the availability of private sector reinsurance for terrorism is limited we rely heavily on the terrorism risk insurance program trip which provides government risk assistance to the insurance industry to manage the exposure to terrorism incident in the trip wa reauthorized in january and is scheduled to expire on december under trip once our loss for certain act of terrorism exceed deductible equal to percent of our commercial property and casualty insurance premium for covered line for the prior calendar year the federal government will reimburse for loss in excess of our deductible starting at percent of loss in percent in and reducing by one percentage point each year ending at percent in up to total industry program limit of billion trip doe not cover loss in certain line of business such personal property and personal casualty we also rely on the government sponsored and government arranged terrorism reinsurance program

arrangement to limit or offset exposure that exceed the limit we wish to retain in certain circumstance however these risk management arrangement may not be available on acceptable term or may prove to be ineffective for certain exposure also our exposure for certain single risk coverage and other coverage may be so large that adverse experience compared to our expectation may have material

strategy and outlook industry and economic factor aig form table of content item risk factor interest rate fluctuation increased lapse and surrender declining investment return and other event may require our subsidiary to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition cost dac and record additional liability for future policy benefit we incur significant cost in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business dac represents deferred cost that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new business or renewal of existing business the recovery of these cost is generally dependent upon the future profitability of the related business but dac amortization varies based on the type of contract for long duration traditional business dac is generally amortized in proportion to premium revenue and varies with lapse experience actual lapse in excess of expectation can result in an acceleration of dac amortization dac for investment oriented product is generally amortized in proportion to estimated gross profit estimated gross profit are affected by number of assumption including current and expected interest rate net investment income and spread net realized capital gain and loss fee surrender rate mortality experience and equity market return and volatility if actual and or future estimated gross profit are le than originally expected the amortization of these cost would be accelerated in the period the actual experience is known and would result in charge to income for example if interest rate rise rapidly and significantly customer with policy that have interest crediting rate below the current market may seek competing product with higher return and we may experience an increase in surrender and withdrawal of life and annuity contract resulting in decrease in future profitability and an acceleration of the amortization of dac we also periodically review product for potential loss recognition event principally insurance oriented product this review involves estimating the future profitability of in force business and requires significant management judgment about assumption including mortality morbidity persistency maintenance expense and investment return including net realized capital gain loss if actual experience or revised future expectation result in projected future loss we may be required to amortize any remaining dac and record additional liability through charge to policyholder benefit expense which could negatively affect our result of operation for further

equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate posted monthly by the irs subject to certain adjustment the annual limitation would be increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in prior year the limitation on our ability to utilize tax loss and credit carryforwards arising from an

liability including recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset and estimate associated with the tax act these accounting estimate require the use of assumption about matter some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation to the extent actual experience differs from the assumption used our consolidated financial condition result of operation and cash flow could be materially affected insurance liability loss reserve the estimate of the loss reserve relies on several key judgment the determination of the actuarial model used the basis for these estimate the relative weight given to these model by product line the underlying assumption used in these model and the determination of the appropriate grouping of similar product line and in some case the disaggregation of dissimilar loss within product line we use numerous assumption in determining the best estimate of reserve for each line of business the importance of any specific assumption can vary by both line of business and accident year because actual experience can differ from key assumption used in establishing reserve there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserve this is particularly true for long tail class of business all of our method to calculate net reserve include assumption about estimated reinsurance recovery and their collectability reinsurance collectability is evaluated independently of the reserving process and appropriate allowance for uncollectible reinsurance are established aig form table of content item critical accounting estimate overview of loss reserving process and method our loss reserve can generally be categorized into two distinct group short tail reserve consists principally of property and special risk europe property and special risk personal insurance and europe and japan personal insurance long tail reserve include worker compensation excess casualty other casualty financial line europe casualty and financial line and run off long tail insurance line short tail reserve for our short tail coverage such property where the nature of claim is generally high frequency with short reporting period with volatility arising from occasional severe event the process for recording non catastrophe quarterly loss reserve is geared toward maintaining ibnr based on percentage of net earned premium for that business rather than projecting ultimate loss ratio based on reported loss for example the ibnr reserve required for the latest accident quarter for product line such homeowner might be approximately percent of the quarter earned premium this level of reserve would generally be recorded regardless of the actual loss reported in the current quarter thus recognizing severe event they occur the percent of premium factor reflects both our expectation of the ultimate loss cost associated with the line of business and the expectation of the percentage of ultimate loss cost that have not yet been reported the expected ultimate loss cost generally reflect the average loss cost from period of preceding accident quarter that have been adjusted for change in rate and loss cost level mix of business known exposure to unreported loss or other factor affecting the particular line of business the expected percentage of ultimate loss cost that have not yet been reported would be derived from historical loss emergence pattern for more mature quarter specific loss development method would be used to determine the ibnr for other product line where the nature of claim is high frequency but low severity method including loss development frequency severity or multiple of average monthly loss may be used to determine ibnr reserve ibnr for claim arising from catastrophic event or event of unusual severity would be determined in close collaboration with the claim department knowledge of known information using alternative technique or expected percentage of ultimate loss cost emergence based on historical loss emergence of similar claim type long tail reserve estimation of ultimate net loss and loss adjustment expense net loss for our long tail casualty line of business is complex process and depends on number of factor including the product line and volume of business well estimate of reinsurance recovery experience in the more recent accident year generally provides limited statistical credibility of reported net loss on long tail casualty line of business that is because in the more recent accident year relatively low proportion of estimated ultimate net incurred loss are reported or paid therefore ibnr reserve constitute relatively high proportion of net loss for our longer tail line we generally make actuarial and other assumption with respect to the following loss cost trend factor are used to establish expected loss ratio for subsequent accident year based on the projected loss ratio for prior accident year expected loss ratio are used for the latest accident year accident year for the year end loss reserve analysis and in some case for accident year prior to the latest accident year the expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident year adjusted for the loss cost trend and the effect of rate change and other quantifiable factor on the loss ratio for low frequency high severity line of business such excess casualty expected loss ratio generally are used for at least the three most recent accident year loss development factor are used to project the reported loss for each accident year to an ultimate basis generally the actual loss development factor observed from prior accident year would be used basis to determine the loss development factor for the subsequent accident year tail factor are development factor used for certain longer tailed line of business for example excess casualty worker compensation and general liability to project future loss development for period that extend beyond the available development data the development of loss to the ultimate loss for given accident year for these line may take decade and the projection of ultimate loss for an accident year is very sensitive to the tail factor selected beyond certain age aig form table of content item critical accounting estimate we record quarterly change in loss reserve for each product line of business the overall change in our loss reserve is based on the sum of the change for all product line of business for most long tail product line of business the quarterly loss reserve change are based on the estimated current loss ratio for each subset of coverage le any amount paid also any change in estimated ultimate loss from prior accident year deemed to be necessary based on the result of our latest detailed valuation review large loss analysis or other analytical technique either positive or negative is reflected in the loss reserve and incurred loss for the current quarter difference between actual loss emergence in given period and our expectation based on prior loss reserve estimate are used to monitor reserve adequacy between detailed valuation review and may also influence our judgment with respect to adjusting reserve estimate detail of the loss reserving process the process of determining the current loss ratio for each product line of business is based on variety of factor these include consideration such prior accident year and policy year loss ratio rate change and change in coverage reinsurance or mix of business other consideration include actual and anticipated change in external factor such trend in loss cost inflation employment rate or unemployment duration or in the legal and claim environment the current loss ratio for each product line of business is intended to represent our best estimate after reflecting all of the relevant factor at the close of each quarter the assumption and data underlying the loss ratio are reviewed to determine whether the loss ratio remain appropriate this process includes review of the actual loss experience in the quarter actual rate change achieved actual change in reinsurance quantifiable change in coverage or mix of business and change in other factor that may affect the loss ratio when this review suggests that the previously determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate the loss ratio is changed to reflect the revised estimate we conduct comprehensive loss detailed valuation review at least annually for each product line of business in accordance with actuarial standard of practice these standard provide that the unpaid loss estimate may be presented in variety of way such point estimate range of estimate point estimate based on the expected value of several reasonable estimate or probability distribution of the unpaid loss amount our actuarial best estimate for each product line of business represents an expected value generally considering range of reasonably possible outcome the reserve analysis for each product line of business is performed by credentialed actuarial team in collaboration with claim underwriting business unit management risk management and senior management our actuary consider the ongoing applicability of prior data grouping and update numerous assumption including the analysis and selection of loss development and loss trend factor they also determine and select the appropriate actuarial or other method used to estimate reserve adequacy for each business product line and may employ multiple method and assumption for each product line these data grouping accident year weight method selection and assumption necessarily change over time business mix change development factor mature and become more credible and loss characteristic evolve in the course of these detailed valuation review an actuarial best estimate of the loss reserve is determined the sum of these estimate for each product line of business yield an overall actuarial best estimate for that line of business for certain product line we measure sensitivity and determine explicit range around the actuarial best estimate using multiple methodology and varying assumption where we have range we use them to inform our selection of best estimate of loss reserve by major product line of business our range of reasonable estimate is not intended to cover all possibility or extreme value and is based on known data and fact at the time of estimation we consult with third party environmental litigation and engineering specialist third party toxic tort claim professional third party clinical and public health specialist third party worker compensation claim adjuster and third party actuarial advisor to help inform our judgment needed critical component of our detailed valuation review is an internal peer review of our reserving analysis and conclusion where actuary independent of the initial review evaluate the reasonableness of assumption used method selected and weighting given to different method in addition each detailed valuation review is subjected to review and challenge process by specialist in our enterprise risk management group aig form table of content item critical accounting estimate we consider key factor in performing detailed actuarial review including an assessment of economic condition including inflation employment rate or unemployment duration change in the legal regulatory judicial and social environment including change in road safety public health and cleanup standard change in medical cost trend inflation intensity and utilization of medical service and wage inflation trend underlying policy pricing term and condition including attachment point and policy limit change in claim handling philosophy operating model process and related ongoing enhancement third party claim review that are periodically performed for key product line such toxic tort environmental and other complex casualty third party actuarial review that are periodically performed for key product line of business input from underwriter on pricing term and condition and market trend and change in our reinsurance program pricing and commutation actuarial and other method for major line of business our actuary determine the appropriate actuarial method and segmentation this determination is based on variety of factor including the nature of the loss associated with the product line of business such the frequency or severity of the claim in addition to determining the actuarial method the actuary determine the appropriate loss reserve grouping of data this determination is judgmental dynamic process and refinement to the grouping are made every year the change to grouping may be driven by and may change to reflect observed or emerging pattern within and across product line or to differentiate different risk characteristic for example size of deductible and extent of third party claim specialist used by our insured an example of reserve segmentation we write many unique subset of professional liability which cover different product industry segment and coverage structure while for pricing or other purpose it may be appropriate to evaluate the profitability of each subset individually we believe it is appropriate to combine the subset into larger group for reserving purpose to produce greater degree of credibility in the loss experience this determination of data segmentation and related actuarial method is assessed reviewed and updated at least annually the actuarial method we use most commonly include paid and incurred loss development method expected loss ratio method including bornhuetter ferguson and cape cod and frequency severity model loss development method utilize the actual loss development pattern from prior accident year updated through the current year to project the reported loss to an ultimate basis for all accident year we also use this information to update our current accident year loss selection loss development method are generally most appropriate for class of business that exhibit stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next and for which the component of the product line have similar development characteristic for example property exposure would generally not be combined into the same product line casualty exposure and primary casualty exposure would generally not be combined into the same product line excess casualty exposure we continually refine our loss reserving technique and adopt further segmentation based on our analysis of differing emerging loss pattern for certain product line we generally use expected loss ratio method in case where the reported loss data lacked sufficient credibility to utilize loss development method such for new product line of business or for long tail product line at early stage of loss development frequency severity model may be used where sufficient frequency count are available to apply such approach expected loss ratio method rely on the application of an expected loss ratio to the earned premium for the product line of business to determine the liability for loss reserve and loss adjustment expense for example an expected loss ratio of percent applied to an earned premium base of million for product line of business would generate an ultimate loss estimate of million subtracting any paid loss and loss adjustment expense would result in the indicated loss reserve for this product line under the bornhuetter ferguson method the expected loss ratio is applied only to the expected unreported portion of the loss for example for long tail product line of business for which only percent of the loss are expected to be reported at the end of the accident year the expected loss ratio would be used to represent the percent of loss still unreported the actual reported loss at the end of the accident year would be added to determine the total ultimate loss estimate for the accident year subtracting the reported paid loss and loss adjustment expense would result in the indicated loss reserve in the example above the expected loss ratio of percent would be multiplied by percent the result of percent would be applied to the earned premium of million resulting in an estimated unreported loss of million actual reported loss would be added to arrive at the total ultimate loss if the reported loss were million the ultimate loss estimate under the bornhuetter ferguson method would be million versus the million amount under the expected loss ratio method described above thus the bornhuetter ferguson method give partial credibility to the actual loss experience to date for the product line of business loss development method generally give full credibility to the reported loss experience to date in the example above loss development method would typically indicate an ultimate loss estimate of million the reported loss of million would be estimated to reflect only percent of the ultimate loss aig form table of content item critical accounting estimate key advantage of loss development method is that they respond more quickly to any actual change in loss cost for the product line of business therefore if loss experience is unexpectedly deteriorating or improving the loss development method give full credibility to the changing experience expected loss ratio method would be slower to respond to the change they would continue to give more weight to prior expected loss ratio until enough evidence emerged to modify the expected loss ratio to reflect the changing loss experience on the other hand loss development method have the disadvantage of overreacting to change in reported loss if the loss experience is anomalous due to the various key factor described above and the inherent volatility in some of the class for example the presence or absence of large loss at the early stage of loss development could cause the loss development method to overreact to the favorable or unfavorable experience by assuming it is fundamental shift in the development pattern in these instance expected loss ratio method such bornhuetter ferguson have the advantage of recognizing large loss without extrapolating unusual large loss activity onto the unreported portion of the loss for the accident year the cape cod method is hybrid between the loss development and bornhuetter ferguson method where the historic loss data and loss development factor assumption are used to determine the expected loss ratio estimate in the bornhuetter ferguson method frequency severity method generally rely on the determination of an ultimate number of claim and an average severity for each claim for each accident year multiplying the estimated ultimate number of claim for each accident year by the expected average severity of each claim produce the estimated ultimate loss for the accident year frequency severity method generally require sufficient volume of claim in order for the average severity to be predictable average severity for subsequent accident year is generally determined by applying an estimated annual loss cost trend to the estimated average claim severity from prior accident year in certain case structural approach may also be used to predict the ultimate loss cost frequency severity method have the advantage that ultimate claim count can generally be estimated more quickly and accurately than can ultimate loss thus if the average claim severity can be accurately estimated these method can more quickly respond to change in loss experience than other method however for average severity to be predictable the product line of business must consist of homogenous type of claim for which loss severity trend from one year to the next are reasonably consistent and where there are limited change to deductible level or limit generally these method work best for high frequency low severity product line of business such personal auto however frequency and severity metric are also used to test the reasonability of result for other product line of business and provide indication of underlying trend in the data in addition ultimate claim count can be used an alternative exposure measure to earned premium in the cape cod method structural driver analytics seek to explain the underlying driver of frequency severity structural driver analysis of frequency severity is particularly useful for understanding the key driver of uncertainty in the ultimate loss cost for example for the excess worker compensation product line of business we have attempted to

unreported claim and the effect of various run off loss management strategy that have been developed by our run off unit aig form table of content item critical accounting estimate in recent year we have expanded our analysis of structural driver to additional product line of business mean of corroborating our judgment using traditional actuarial technique for example we have explicitly used external estimate of future medical inflation and mortality in estimating the loss development tail for excess of deductible primary worker compensation business using external forecast for item such these can improve the accuracy and stability of our estimate the estimation of liability for loss reserve and loss adjustment expense relating to asbestos and environmental pollution loss on insurance policy written many year ago is typically subject to greater uncertainty than other type of loss this is due to inconsistent court decision well judicial interpretation and legislative action that in some case have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policy or have expanded theory of liability in addition reinsurance recoverable balance relating to asbestos and environmental loss reserve are subject to greater uncertainty due to the underlying age of the claim underlying legal issue surrounding the nature of the coverage and determination of proper policy period for these reason these balance tend to be subject to increased level of dispute and legal collection activity when actually billed the insurance industry whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issue and is thus confronted with continuing uncertainty in it effort to quantify these exposure we continue to receive claim asserting injury and damage from toxic waste hazardous substance and other environmental pollutant and alleged claim to cover the cleanup cost of hazardous waste dump site referred to collectively environmental claim and indemnity claim asserting injury from asbestos the vast majority of these asbestos and environmental loss emanate from policy written in and prior year commencing in standard policy contained absolute exclusion for pollution related damage and asbestos the current environmental policy that we specifically price and underwrite for environmental risk on claim made basis have been excluded from the analysis the majority of our exposure for asbestos and environmental loss are related to excess casualty coverage not primary coverage the litigation cost are treated in the same manner indemnity amount with litigation expense included within the limit of the liability we incur individual significant loss reserve where future litigation cost are reasonably determinable are established on case by case basis discussion of key assumption of our actuarial method line of business or category key assumption worker compensation we generally use combination of loss development and expected loss ratio method for worker compensation this line of business is long tail the loss cost trend assumption is not believed to be material with respect to our guaranteed cost loss reserve this is primarily because our actuary are generally able to use loss development projection for all but the most recent accident year reserve so there is limited need to rely on loss cost trend assumption for primary worker compensation business the tail factor is typically the most critical assumption and small change in the selected tail factor can have material effect on our carried reserve for example the tail factor beyond twenty year for guaranteed cost business could vary by one and one half percent below to two percent above those actually indicated in the loss reserve review for excess of deductible business in our judgment it is reasonably likely that tail factor beyond twenty year could vary by four percent below to six percent above those actually indicated in the loss reserve review aig form table of content item critical accounting estimate line of business or category key assumption excess casualty we utilize various loss cost trend assumption for different segment of the portfolio after evaluating the historical loss cost trend from prior accident year since the early in our judgment it is reasonably likely that actual loss cost trend applicable to the year end loss reserve review for excess casualty may range five percent lower or higher than this estimated loss trend the loss cost trend assumption is critical for the excess casualty class of business due to the long tail nature of the loss and is applied across many accident year thus there is the potential for the loss reserve with respect to number of accident year the expected loss ratio year to be significantly affected by change in loss cost trend that were initially relied upon in setting the loss reserve these change in loss trend could be attributable to change in inflation or in the judicial environment or in other social or economic condition affecting loss excess casualty is long tail class of business and any deviation in loss development factor might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimate for any accident year mass tort claim in particular may develop over very extended period and impact multiple accident year so we usually select separate pattern for them thus there is the potential for the loss reserve with respect to number of accident year to be significantly affected by change in loss development factor that were initially relied upon in setting the reserve after evaluating the historical loss development factor from prior accident year since the early in our judgment it is reasonably likely that the actual loss development factor could vary by an amount equivalent to six month shift from those actually utilized in the year end reserve review this would impact projection both for accident year where the selection were directly based on loss development method well the priori loss ratio assumption for accident year with selection based on bornhuetter ferguson or cape cod method similar to loss cost trend these change in loss development factor could be attributable to change in inflation or in the judicial environment or in other social or economic condition affecting loss other casualty the key uncertainty for other casualty line are similar to excess casualty the underlying business is long tailed and can be subject to variability in loss cost trend and change in loss development factor these may differ significantly by line of business coverage such general liability medical malpractice and environmental may be subject to different risk driver financial line the loss cost trend for business vary by year and subset but for the most recent accident year it is assumed to have been generally close to zero after evaluating the historical loss cost level from prior accident year since the early including the potential effect of loss relating to the credit crisis in our judgment it is reasonably likely that the actual variation in loss cost level for these subset could vary by approximately percent lower or higher on year over year basis than the assumption actually utilized in the year end reserve review because business ha exhibited highly volatile loss trend from one accident year to the next there is the possibility of an exceptionally high deviation in our analysis the effect of loss cost trend assumption affect the result through the priori loss ratio assumption used for the bornhuetter ferguson and cape cod method which impact the projection for the more recent accident year the selected loss development factor are also an important assumption but are le critical than for excess casualty because these class are written on claim made basis the loss reporting and development tail is much shorter than for excess casualty however the high severity nature of the loss doe create the potential for significant deviation in loss development pattern from one year to the next similar to excess casualty after evaluating the historical loss development factor from prior accident year since the early in our judgment it is reasonably likely that actual loss development factor could change by an amount equivalent to shift by six month from those actually utilized in the year end reserve review europe casualty and financial line similar to business european casualty and financial line can be significantly impacted by loss cost trend and change in loss development factor the variation in such factor can differ significantly by product and region property and special risk and europe property and special risk for short tail line such property and special risk variance in outcome for individual large claim or event can have significant impact on result these outcome generally relate to unique characteristic of event such catastrophe or loss with significant business interruption claim personal insurance and europe and japan personal insurance personal insurance is short tailed in nature similar to property and special risk but le volatile variance in estimate can result from unique event such catastrophe in addition some subset of this business such auto liability can be impacted by change in loss development factor and loss cost trend aig form table of content item critical accounting estimate line of business or category key assumption run off long tail insurance line we historically have used combination of loss development method and expected loss ratio method for excess worker compensation and other run off segment for environmental claim we have utilized variety of method including traditional loss development approach claim department and other expert evaluation of the ultimate cost for certain claim and survival ratio metric run off long tail insurance line is an extremely long tail class of business with much greater than normal uncertainty to the appropriate loss development factor for the tail of the loss development specifically for excess worker compensation after evaluating the historical loss development factor for prior accident year since the well the development over the past several year of the ground up loss projection utilized to help select the loss development factor in the tail for this class of business in our judgment it is reasonably likely that the tail factor beyond year could vary by percent above or below that actually indicated in the loss reserve review other reserve item loss adjustment expense lae are separated into two broad category allocated loss adjustment expense ala also referred to legal defense and cost containment or legal and unallocated loss adjustment expense ulae which includes certain claim adjuster fee and other internal claim management cost we determine reserve for legal expense for each class of business by one or more actuarial or structural driver method for the majority of segment legal cost are analyzed in conjunction with loss for segment where they are separately analyzed the method used generally include development method comparable to those described for loss development method the development could be based on either the paid loss adjustment expense or the ratio of paid loss adjustment expense to paid loss or both other method include the utilization of expected ultimate ratio of paid loss expense to paid loss based on actual experience from prior accident year or from similar product line of business the bulk of adjuster expense are allocated and charged to individual claim file for these expense we generally determine reserve based on calendar year ratio of adjuster expense paid to loss paid for the particular product line of business for other internal claim cost which generally relate to specific claim department expense that are not allocated to individual claim file such technology cost and other broad initiative we look at historic and expected expenditure for these item and project these into the future the incidence of lae is directly related to the frequency complexity and level of underlying claim result key driver of variability in lae is the variability in the overall claim particularly for long

market risk management related to these product feature see enterprise risk management insurance risk life and retirement company key risk variable annuity risk management and hedging program difference in valuation of embedded derivative and economic hedge target the variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risk in our gmwb rider the economic hedge target differs from the gaap valuation of the gmwb embedded derivative primarily due to the following the economic hedge target includes percent of rider fee in present value calculation the gaap valuation reflects only those fee attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equal zero the economic hedge target us best estimate actuarial assumption and excludes explicit risk margin used for gaap valuation such margin for policyholder behavior mortality and volatility and the economic hedge target excludes the non performance or own credit risk adjustment used in the gaap valuation which reflects market participant view of our claim paying ability by incorporating an additional spread the npa spread to the swap curve used to discount projected benefit cash flow because the discount rate includes the npa spread and other explicit risk margin the gaap valuation is generally le sensitive to movement in interest rate and other market factor and to change from actuarial assumption update than the economic hedge target for more information on our valuation methodology for embedded derivative within policyholder contract deposit see note to the consolidated financial statement the market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting in addition to the derivative held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program the life and retirement company have cash and invested asset available to cover future claim payable under these guarantee the primary source of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund return which may be either positive or negative realized volatility versus implied volatility actual versus expected change in the hedge target driven by

client event such fire or explosion can result in loss activity for our client the net risk to is managed to acceptable limit established by our grc through combination of internal underwriting standard and external reinsurance furthermore single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both segregated and aggregated basis reinsurance since we use reinsurance to limit our loss we are exposed to risk associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payment from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay contract that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated the inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management

the standard for those revenue source within the scope of the standard there were no material change in the timing or measurement of revenue based upon the guidance substantially all of our revenue source were excluded from the scope of the standard the adoption of the standard did not have material impact on our reported consolidated financial condition result of operation cash flow or required disclosure recognition and measurement of financial asset and financial liability in january the fasb issued an accounting standard that requires equity investment that do not follow the equity method of accounting or are not subject to consolidation to be measured at fair value with change in fair value recognized in earnings while financial liability for which fair value option accounting ha been elected change in fair value due to instrument specific credit risk are presented separately in other comprehensive income the standard allows the election to record equity investment without readily determinable fair value at cost le impairment adjusted for subsequent observable price change with change in the carrying value of the equity investment recorded in earnings the standard also update certain fair value disclosure requirement for financial instrument carried at amortized cost we adopted the standard on it effective date of january using the modified retrospective approach the impact of the adoption is primarily related to the reclassification of unrealized gain of equity security resulting in net decrease to beginning accumulated other comprehensive income and corresponding net increase to beginning retained earnings of million classification of certain cash receipt and cash payment in august the fasb issued an accounting standard that address diversity in

disclosure gain and loss from the derecognition of nonfinancial asset in february the fasb issued an accounting standard that clarifies the scope of the derecognition guidance for the sale transfer and derecognition of non financial asset to noncustomers that aligns with the new revenue recognition principle the standard also add new accounting for partial sale of nonfinancial asset including real estate that requires an entity to derecognize nonfinancial asset when it cease to have controlling financial interest in the legal entity that hold the asset based on the consolidation model and transfer control of the asset based on the revenue recognition model we adopted this standard on it effective date of january using the modified retrospective approach based on our evaluation the adoption of this standard did not have material impact on our reported consolidated financial condition result of operation cash flow or required disclosure improving the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost in march the fasb issued an accounting standard that requires entity to report the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost in the same line item other compensation cost arising from service rendered by the pertinent employee during the period the other component of net periodic benefit cost are required to be

optional reclassification of stranded tax effect within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings that arise due to the enactment of the tax cut and job act of tax act the amount of the reclassification would reflect the impact of the change in the federal corporate income tax rate on the gross deferred tax amount and related valuation allowance if any at the date of enactment of the tax act and other income tax effect of the tax act on item remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income aig form table of content item note to consolidated financial statement summary of

purpose the fasb retained dual model requiring lease to be classified either operating lease or finance lease lessor accounting remained largely the same with the exception of certain specified change the standard is effective for annual period beginning after december and interim period within those year using modified retrospective approach and provides for certain practical expedient in transition during the fasb issued several amendment and targeted improvement to ease with the application of the standard including the addition of transition approach that give the company the option of applying the standard at either the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented or the beginning of the period of adoption we plan to adopt the standard on it effective date of january by recognizing cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for lease existing at the date of adoption we will also elect certain practical expedient that allow not to reassess existing lease under the new guidance based on our analysis the vast majority of the company lease obligation pertained to real estate utilized in the operation of our business consequently the primary impact of adoption will result in the recognition of right of use asset and lease liability for operating lease pertaining to our real estate portfolio that are expected to represent le than one percent of the company total asset and total liability respectively we do not expect the standard to have material effect on our reported consolidated financial condition result of operation cash flow or required disclosure see note contingency commitment and guarantee for additional information financial instrument credit loss in june the fasb issued an accounting standard that will change how entity account for credit loss for most financial asset trade receivables and reinsurance receivables the standard will replace the existing incurred loss impairment model with new current

reinsurance receivables and certain off balance sheet credit exposure additionally the impairment of available for sale debt security including purchased credit deteriorated security are subject to the new guidance and will be measured in similar manner except that loss will be recognized allowance rather than reduction in the amortized cost of the security the standard will also require additional information to be disclosed in the footnote we plan to adopt the standard on it effective date of january we are continuing to develop our implementation plan to adopt the standard and are assessing the impact of the standard on our reported consolidated financial condition result of operation cash flow and required disclosure while we expect an increase in our allowance for credit loss for the financial instrument within scope of the standard given the objective of the new standard the amount of any change will be dependent on our portfolio composition and quality at the adoption date well economic condition and forecast at that time simplifying the test for goodwill impairment in january the fasb issued an accounting standard that eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill through hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure goodwill impairment charge instead entity will record an impairment charge based on the excess of reporting unit carrying amount over it fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit an entity should also consider income tax effect from tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss if applicable the standard is effective on january with early adoption permitted we are evaluating the timing of our adoption any impact of the standard will be dependent on the market condition of the reporting unit at the time of adoption premium amortization on purchased callable debt security in march the fasb issued an accounting standard that shortens the amortization period for certain callable debt security held at premium by requiring the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date the standard

requirement for long duration contract issued by an insurance entity the standard prescribes significant and comprehensive change to recognition measurement presentation and disclosure summarized below requires the review and if necessary update of future policy benefit assumption at least annually for traditional and limited pay long duration contract with the recognition and separate presentation of any resulting re measurement gain or loss except for discount rate change noted below in the income statement requires the discount rate assumption to be updated at the end of each reporting period using an upper medium grade low credit risk fixed income instrument yield that maximizes the use of observable market input and recognizes the impact of change to discount rate in other comprehensive income simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition cost dac to constant level basis over the expected term of the related contract with adjustment for unexpected termination but no longer requires an impairment test requires the measurement of all market risk benefit associated with deposit or account balance contract at fair value through the income statement with the exception of instrument specific credit risk change which will be recognized in other comprehensive income increased disclosure of disaggregated roll forward of policy benefit account balance

value of the investment carried at fair value and the supporting methodology and assumption the degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instrument generally inversely correlate with the level of observable valuation input we maximize the use of observable input and minimize the use of unobservable input when measuring fair value financial instrument with quoted price in active market generally have more pricing observability and le judgment is used in measuring fair value conversely financial instrument for which no quoted price are available have le

position classified in level the circumstance for using these measurement include those in which there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability therefore we must make certain assumption about the input hypothetical market participant would use to value that asset or liability in certain case the input used to measure fair value may fall into different level of the fair value hierarchy in such case the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in it entirety fall is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in it entirety the following is description of the valuation methodology used for instrument carried at fair value these methodology are applied to asset and liability across

the explicit cost for to protect against our net credit exposure to each counterparty at the balance sheet date by reference to observable counterparty cd spread when available when not available other directly or indirectly observable credit spread will be used to derive the best estimate of the counterparty spread our net credit exposure to counterparty is determined based on master netting agreement which take into consideration all derivative position with the counterparty well collateral posted by the counterparty at the balance sheet date fair value for fixed maturity security based on observable market price for identical or similar instrument implicitly incorporate counterparty credit risk fair value for fixed maturity security based on internal model incorporate counterparty credit risk by using discount rate that take into consideration cash issuance spread for similar instrument or other observable information for fair value measured based on internal model the cost of credit protection is determined under discounted present value approach considering the market level for single name cd spread for each specific counterparty the mid market value of the net exposure reflecting the amount of protection required and the weighted average life of the net exposure cd spread are provided to by an independent third party we utilize an interest rate based on the benchmark london interbank offered rate libor curve to derive our discount rate while this approach doe not explicitly consider all potential future behavior of the derivative transaction or potential future change in valuation input we believe this approach provides reasonable estimate of the fair value of the asset and liability including consideration of the impact of non performance risk fixed maturity security whenever available we obtain quoted price in active market for identical asset at the balance sheet date to measure fixed maturity security at fair value market price data is generally obtained from dealer market we employ independent third party valuation service provider to gather analyze and interpret market information to derive fair value estimate for individual investment based upon market accepted methodology and assumption the methodology used by these independent third party valuation service provider are reviewed and understood by management through periodic discussion with and information provided by the independent third party valuation service provider in addition discussed further below control process are applied to the fair value received from independent third party valuation service provider to ensure the accuracy of these value valuation service provider typically obtain data about market transaction and other key valuation model input from multiple source and through the use of market accepted valuation methodology which may utilize matrix pricing financial model accompanying model input and various assumption provide single fair value measurement for individual security the input used by the valuation service provider include but are not limited to market price from completed transaction for identical security and transaction for comparable security benchmark yield interest rate yield curve credit spread prepayment rate default rate recovery assumption currency rate quoted price for similar security and other market observable information applicable if fair value is determined using financial model these model generally take into account among other thing market observable information of the measurement date well the specific attribute of the security being valued including it term interest rate credit rating industry sector and when applicable collateral quality and other security or issuer specific information when market transaction or other market observable data is limited the extent to which judgment is applied in determining fair value is greatly increased aig form table of content item note to consolidated financial statement fair value measurement we have control process designed to ensure that the fair value received from independent third party valuation service provider are accurately recorded that their data input and valuation technique are appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumption used appear reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value we ass the reasonableness of individual security value received from independent third party valuation service provider through various analytical technique and have procedure to escalate related question internally and to the independent third party valuation service provider for resolution to ass the degree of pricing consensus among various valuation service provider for specific asset type we conduct comparison of price received from available source we use these comparison to establish hierarchy for the fair value received from independent third party valuation service provider to be used for particular security class we also validate price for selected security through review by member of management who have relevant expertise and who are independent of those charged with executing investing transaction when our independent third party valuation service provider are unable to obtain sufficient market observable information upon which to estimate the fair value for particular security fair value is determined either by requesting broker who are knowledgeable about these security to provide price quote which is generally non binding or by employing market accepted valuation model broker price may be based on an income approach which convert expected future cash flow to single present value amount with specific consideration of input relevant to particular security type for structured security such input may include rating collateral type geographic concentration underlying loan vintage loan delinquency and default loss severity assumption prepayment and weighted average coupon and maturity when the volume or level of market activity for security is limited certain input used to determine fair value may not be observable in the market broker price may also be based on market approach that considers recent transaction involving identical or similar security fair value provided by broker are subject to similar control process to those noted above for fair value from independent third party valuation service provider including management review for those corporate debt instrument for example private placement that are not traded in active market or that are subject to transfer restriction valuation reflect illiquidity and non transferability based on available market evidence when observable price quotation are not available fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow model using discount rate based on credit spread yield or price level of comparable security adjusted for illiquidity and structure fair value determined internally are also subject to management review to ensure that valuation model and related input are reasonable the methodology above is relevant for all fixed maturity security including residential mortgage backed security rmbs commercial mortgage backed security cmb collateralized debt obligation cdo other asset backed security ab and fixed maturity security issued by government sponsored entity and corporate entity equity security traded in active market whenever available we obtain quoted price in active market for identical asset at the balance sheet date to measure equity security at fair value market price data is generally obtained from exchange or dealer market mortgage and other loan receivable we estimate the fair value of mortgage and other loan receivable that are measured at fair value by using dealer quotation discounted cash flow analysis and or internal valuation model the determination of fair value considers input such interest rate maturity the borrower creditworthiness collateral subordination guarantee past due status yield curve credit curve prepayment rate market pricing for comparable loan and other relevant factor other invested asset we initially estimate the fair value of investment in certain hedge fund private equity fund and other investment partnership by reference to the transaction price subsequently we generally obtain the fair value of these investment from net asset value information provided by the general partner or manager of the investment the financial statement of which are generally audited annually we consider observable market data and perform certain control procedure to validate the appropriateness of using the net asset value fair value measurement the fair value of other investment carried at fair value such direct private equity holding are initially determined based on transaction price and are subsequently estimated based on available evidence such market transaction in

item note to consolidated financial statement fair value measurement short term investment for short term investment that are measured at amortized cost the carrying amount of these asset approximate fair value because of the relatively short period of time between origination and expected realization and their limited exposure to credit risk security purchased under agreement to resell reverse repurchase agreement are generally treated collateralized receivables we report certain receivables arising from security purchased under agreement to resell short term investment in the consolidated balance sheet when these receivables are measured at fair value we use market observable interest rate to determine fair value separate account asset separate account asset are composed primarily of registered and unregistered open end mutual fund that generally trade daily and are measured at fair value in the manner discussed above for equity security traded in active market freestanding derivative derivative asset and liability can be exchange traded or traded over the counter otc we generally value exchange traded derivative such future and option using quoted price in active market for identical derivative at the balance sheet date otc derivative are valued using market transaction and other market evidence whenever possible including market based input to model model calibration to market clearing transaction broker or dealer quotation or alternative pricing source with reasonable level of price transparency when model are used the selection of particular model to value an otc derivative depends on the contractual term of and specific risk inherent in the instrument well the availability of pricing information in the market we generally use similar model to value similar instrument valuation model require variety of input including contractual term market price and rate yield curve credit curve measure of volatility prepayment rate and correlation of such input for otc derivative that trade in liquid market such generic forward swap and option model input can generally be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other mean and model selection doe not involve significant management judgment for certain otc derivative that trade in le liquid market where we generally do not have corroborating market evidence to support significant model input and can not verify the model to market transaction the transaction price may provide the best estimate of fair value accordingly when pricing model is used to value such an instrument the model is adjusted so the model value at inception equal the transaction price we will update valuation input in these model only when corroborated by evidence such similar market transaction independent third party valuation service provider and or broker or dealer quotation or other empirical market data when appropriate valuation are adjusted for various factor such liquidity bid offer spread and credit consideration such adjustment are generally based on available market evidence in the absence of such evidence management best estimate is used we value our super senior credit default swap portfolio using price obtained from vendor and or counterparties the valuation of the super senior credit derivative is complex because of the limited availability of market observable information due to the lack of trading and price transparency in certain structured finance market our valuation methodology for the super senior cd portfolio have evolved over time in response to market condition and the availability of market observable information we have sought to calibrate the methodology to available market information and to review the assumption of the methodology on regular basis embedded derivative within policyholder contract deposit certain variable annuity and equity indexed annuity and life contract contain embedded derivative that we bifurcate from the host contract and account for separately at fair value with change in fair value recognized in earnings these embedded derivative are classified within policyholder contract deposit we have concluded these contract contain either written option that guarantee minimum accumulation value at maturity ii written option that guarantee annual withdrawal regardless of underlying market performance for specific period or for life or iii equity indexed written option that meet the criterion of derivative and must be bifurcated aig form table of content item note to consolidated financial statement fair value measurement the fair value of embedded derivative contained in certain variable annuity and equity indexed annuity and life contract is measured based on policyholder behavior and capital market assumption related to projected cash flow over the expected life of the contract these discounted cash flow projection primarily include benefit and related fee assessed when applicable in some instance the projected cash flow from fee may exceed projected cash flow related to benefit payment and therefore at point in time the carrying value of the embedded derivative may be in net asset position the projected cash flow incorporate best estimate assumption for policyholder behavior including mortality lapse withdrawal and benefit utilization along with an explicit risk margin to reflect market participant estimate of projected cash flow and policyholder behavior estimate of future policyholder behavior assumption are subjective and based primarily on our historical experience because of the dynamic and complex nature of the projected cash flow with respect to embedded derivative in our variable annuity contract risk neutral valuation are used which are calibrated to observable interest rate and equity option price estimating the underlying cash flow for these product involves judgment regarding expected market rate of return market volatility credit spread correlation of certain market variable fund performance discount rate and policyholder behavior the portion of fee attributable to the fair value of expected benefit payment are included within the fair value measurement of these embedded derivative and related fee are classified in net realized gain loss earned consistent with other change in the fair value of these embedded policy derivative any portion of the fee not attributed to the embedded derivative are excluded from the fair value measurement and classified in policy fee earned with respect to embedded derivative in our equity indexed annuity and life contract option pricing model are used to estimate fair value taking into account assumption for future equity index growth rate volatility of the equity index future interest rate and our ability to adjust the participation rate and the cap on equity indexed credited rate in light of market condition and policyholder behavior assumption projected cash flow are discounted using the interest rate swap curve swap curve which is commonly viewed being consistent with the credit spread for highly rated financial institution aa rated or above swap curve show the fixed rate leg of non complex swap against the floating rate for example libor leg of related tenor we also incorporate our own risk of non performance in the valuation of the embedded derivative associated with variable annuity and equity indexed annuity and life contract the non performance risk adjustment reflects market participant view of our claim paying ability by incorporating an additional spread to the swap curve used to discount projected benefit cash flow in the valuation of these embedded derivative the non performance risk adjustment is calculated by constructing forward rate based on weighted average of observable corporate credit index to approximate the claim paying ability rating of our life and retirement company long term debt the fair value of non structured liability is generally determined by using market price from exchange or dealer market when available or discounting expected cash flow using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable maturity we determine the fair value of structured liability and hybrid financial instrument where performance is linked to structured interest rate inflation or currency risk using the appropriate derivative valuation methodology described above given the nature of the embedded risk profile in addition adjustment are made to the valuation of both non structured and structured liability to reflect our own creditworthiness based on the methodology described under the caption incorporation of credit risk in fair value measurement our own credit risk above borrowing under obligation of guaranteed

to about the assumption that market participant would use when pricing the asset or liability relevant input vary depending on the nature of the instrument being measured at fair value the following paragraph provide general description of sensitivity of significant unobservable input along with interrelationship between and among the significant unobservable input and their impact on the fair value measurement the effect of change in particular assumption in the sensitivity analysis below is considered independently of change in any other assumption in practice simultaneous change in assumption may not always have linear effect on the input discussed below interrelationship may also exist between observable and unobservable input such relationship have not been included in the discussion below for each of the individual relationship described below the inverse relationship would also generally apply obligation of state municipality and political subdivision the significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of certain investment in obligation of state municipality and political subdivision is yield in general increase in the yield would decrease the fair value of investment in obligation of state municipality and political subdivision corporate debt corporate debt security included in level are primarily private placement issuance that are not traded in active market or that are subject to transfer restriction fair value measurement consider illiquidity and non transferability when observable price quotation are not available fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow model using discount rate based on credit spread yield or price level of publicly traded debt of the issuer or other comparable security considering illiquidity and structure the significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of corporate debt is the yield the yield is affected by the market movement in credit spread and treasury yield in addition the migration in credit quality of given security generally ha corresponding effect on the fair value measurement of the security for example downward migration of credit quality would increase spread holding treasury rate constant an increase in corporate credit spread would decrease the fair value of corporate debt rmbs and cdo ab the significant unobservable input used in fair value measurement of rmbs and certain cdo ab valued by third party valuation service provider are constant prepayment rate cpr loss severity constant default rate cdr and yield change in the assumption used for the probability of default will generally be accompanied by corresponding change in the assumption used for the loss severity and an inverse change in the assumption used for prepayment rate in general increase in cpr loss severity cdr and yield in isolation would result in decrease in the fair value measurement change in fair value based on variation in assumption generally can not be extrapolated because the relationship between the directional change of each input is not usually linear cmb the significant unobservable input used in fair value measurement for cmb is the yield prepayment assumption for each mortgage pool are factored into the yield cmb generally feature lower degree of prepayment risk than rmbs because commercial mortgage generally contain

projected for purpose of valuing the embedded derivative the following unobservable input are used for valuing embedded derivative measured at fair value long term equity volatility represent equity volatility beyond the period for which observable equity volatility are available increase in assumed volatility will generally increase the fair value of both the projected cash flow from rider fee well the projected cash flow related to benefit payment therefore the net change in the fair value of the liability may be either decrease or an increase depending on the relative change in projected rider fee and projected benefit payment equity interest rate correlation estimate the relationship between change in equity return and interest rate in the economic scenario generator used to value our gmwb embedded derivative in general higher positive correlation assumes that equity market and interest rate move in more correlated fashion which generally increase the fair value of the liability base lapse rate assumption are determined by company experience and are adjusted at the contract level using dynamic lapse function which reduces the base lapse rate when the contract is in the money when the contract holder guaranteed value estimated by the company is worth more than their underlying account value lapse rate are also generally assumed to be lower in period when surrender charge applies increase in assumed lapse rate will generally decrease the fair value of the liability fewer policyholder would persist to collect guaranteed withdrawal amount mortality rate assumption which vary by age and gender are based on company experience and include mortality improvement assumption increase in assumed mortality rate will decrease the fair value of the liability while lower mortality rate assumption will generally increase the fair value of the liability because guaranteed payment will be made for longer period of time utilization assumption estimate the timing when policyholder with gmwb will elect to utilize their benefit and begin taking withdrawal the assumption may vary by the type of guarantee tax qualified status the contract withdrawal history and the age of the policyholder utilization assumption are based on company experience which includes partial withdrawal behavior increase in assumed utilization rate will generally increase the fair

candidate for other than temporary impairment if they meet any of the following criterion the security ha traded at significant percent or more discount to cost for an extended period of time nine consecutive month or longer discrete credit event ha occurred resulting in the issuer defaulting on material outstanding obligation ii the issuer seeking protection from creditor under the bankruptcy

collection of all amount due under contractual term is not probable impairment is measured using either the present value of expected future cash flow discounted at the loan effective interest rate ii the loan observable market price if available or iii the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent impairment of commercial mortgage is typically determined using the fair value of collateral while impairment of other loan is typically determined using the present value of cash flow or the loan observable market price an allowance is typically established for the difference between the impaired value of the loan and it current carrying amount additional allowance amount are established for incurred but not specifically identified impairment based on statistical model primarily driven by past due status debt service coverage loan to value ratio property type and location loan term profile of the borrower and of the major property tenant and loan seasoning when all or portion of loan is deemed uncollectible the uncollectible portion of the carrying amount of the loan is charged off against the allowance interest income is not accrued when payment of contractual principal and interest is not expected any cash received on impaired loan is generally recorded reduction of the current carrying amount of the loan accrual of interest income is generally resumed when delinquent contractual principal and interest is repaid or when portion of the delinquent contractual payment are made and the ongoing required contractual payment have been made for an

insurance contract investment income is anticipated in assessing the recoverability of dac we ass the recoverability of dac on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstance indicate an impairment may have occurred this assessment is performed by comparing recorded net unearned premium and anticipated investment income on in force business to the sum of expected loss and loss adjustment expense incurred unamortized dac and maintenance cost if the sum of these cost exceeds the amount of recorded net unearned premium and anticipated investment income the excess is recognized an offset against

include mortality morbidity persistency maintenance expense and investment return and include margin for adverse deviation to reflect uncertainty given that actual experience might deviate from these assumption loss recognition event occurs when there is shortfall between the carrying amount of future policy benefit liability net of dac and what the future policy benefit liability net of dac would be when applying updated current assumption when we determine loss recognition event ha occurred we first reduce any dac related to that block of business through amortization of acquisition expense and after dac is depleted we record additional liability through charge to policyholder benefit and loss incurred grouping for loss recognition testing are consistent with our manner of acquiring servicing and measuring the profitability of the business and applied by product grouping we perform separate loss recognition test for traditional life product payout annuity and long term care product once loss recognition ha been recorded for block of business the old assumption set is replaced and the assumption set used for the loss recognition would then be subject to the lock in principle investment oriented contract certain policy acquisition cost and policy issuance cost related to universal life and investment type product collectively investment oriented product are deferred and amortized with interest in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profit to be realized over the estimated life of the contract estimated gross profit include net investment income

profit if estimated gross profit change significantly dac is recalculated using the new assumption and any resulting adjustment is included in income if the new assumption indicate that future estimated gross profit are higher than previously estimated dac will be increased resulting in decrease in amortization expense and increase in income in the current period if future estimated gross profit are lower than previously estimated dac will be decreased resulting in an increase in amortization expense and decrease in income in the current period updating such assumption may result in acceleration of amortization in some product and deceleration of amortization in other product dac is grouped consistent with the manner in which the insurance contract are acquired serviced and measured for profitability and is reviewed for recoverability based on the current and projected future profitability of the underlying insurance contract to estimate future estimated gross profit for variable annuity product long term annual asset growth assumption is applied to determine the future growth in asset and related asset based fee in determining the asset growth rate the effect of short term fluctuation in the equity market is partially mitigated through the use of reversion to the mean methodology whereby short term asset growth above or below long term annual rate assumption impact the growth assumption applied to the five year period subsequent to the current balance sheet date the reversion to the mean methodology allows to maintain our long term growth assumption while also giving consideration to the effect of actual investment performance when actual performance significantly deviate from the annual long term growth assumption evidenced by growth assumption in the five year reversion to the mean period falling below certain rate floor or above certain rate cap for sustained period judgment may be applied to revise or unlock the growth rate assumption to be used for both the five year reversion to the mean period well the long term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent period shadow dac and shadow loss recognition dac related to investment oriented product is also adjusted to reflect the effect of unrealized gain or loss on fixed maturity security available for sale and prior to equity security at fair value on estimated gross profit with related change recognized through other comprehensive income shadow dac the adjustment is made at each balance sheet date if the security had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yield similarly for long duration traditional insurance contract if the asset supporting the liability are in net unrealized gain position at the balance sheet date loss recognition testing assumption are updated to exclude such gain from future cash flow by reflecting the impact of reinvestment rate on future yield if future loss is anticipated under this basis any additional shortfall indicated by loss recognition test is recognized reduction in accumulated other comprehensive income shadow loss recognition similar to other loss recognition on long duration insurance contract such shortfall is first reflected reduction in dac and secondly an increase in liability for future policy benefit the change in these adjustment net of tax is included with the

qualitative factor to determine whether event or circumstance exist that lead to determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an operating segment is le than it carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not performed or after assessing the totality of the event or circumstance we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of an operating segment is le than it carrying amount the impairment assessment involves two step process in which quantitative assessment for potential impairment is performed if the qualitative test is not performed or if the test indicates potential impairment is present we estimate the fair value of each operating segment and compare the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the operating segment including allocated goodwill the estimate of an operating segment fair value involves management judgment and is based on one or combination of approach including discounted expected future cash flow market based earnings multiple of the unit peer company external appraisal or in the case of reporting unit being considered for sale third party indication of fair value if available we consider one or more of these estimate when determining the fair value of an operating segment to be used in the impairment test if the estimated fair value of an operating segment exceeds it carrying amount goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value of an operating segment exceeds it estimated fair value goodwill associated with that operating segment potentially is impaired the amount of impairment if any is measured the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill the implied fair value of the goodwill is measured the excess of the fair value of the operating

cover and the asbestos cession to nico the key component of this development were follows unfavorable development in excess casualty driven by the combination of construction defect and construction wrap claim from accident year and prior where we reacted to significant increase in severity and longer claim reporting pattern well higher than expected loss severity in accident year and which led to an increase in estimate for these accident year unfavorable development in financial line primarily from director officer and employment practice liability epli policy covering corporate and national insured well private and not for profit insured this development wa predominantly in accident year and resulted largely from increase in severity associated with an increase in frequency of class action lawsuit from those year favorable development in commercial property and specialty line due to reduction in our estimate for catastrophe favorable attritional loss in commercial property and favorable specialty emergence unfavorable development in personal line reflecting the adverse development on the california wildfire and hurricane irma in unfavorable development in international financial line driven by increased large loss activity in recent accident year particularly related to director and officer class action suit against insured with global exposure our analysis and conclusion about prior year reserve also help inform our judgment about the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio we selected during we recognized unfavorable prior year loss reserve development of billion this unfavorable development wa primarily result of the following unfavorable development in casualty line driven primarily by increase in underlying severity and greater than expected emerging loss experience in accident year well increased development from claim related to construction defect and construction wrap business largely from accident year and prior unfavorable development in financial line primarily from director officer policy covering privately owned and not for profit insured this development wa predominantly in accident year and resulted largely from increase in bankruptcy related claim and fiduciary liability claim for large educational institution higher than expected loss for uk europe casualty and financial line we observed significant increase in large claim activity in our uk europe long tail business with large proportion emanating from accident year in addition we increased our loss reserve result of the decision made by the ministry of justice to reduce the discount rate applied to lump sum bodily injury payouts known the ogden rate in addition we also observed higher than expected loss in uk europe property and special risk business driven by unexpected development on various large claim across the property aviation marine and trade credit segment during we recognized adverse prior year loss reserve development of billion this unfavorable development wa primarily result of the following higher than expected loss emerging across several casualty product line especially in the recent accident year generally to driven by increased frequency and severity of claim this recent accident year loss emergence caused to increase loss development factor applied across many accident year loss development factor including worker compensation tail factor also increased due to an observed lengthening of loss reporting pattern relative to prior expectation increase in loss trend assumption to reflect the latest observed increase in frequency and severity and the impact of these increased loss trend on expected loss ratio change in weight we apply to the various actuarial method to better align with

number of reported claim the total of ibnr liability and expected development on reported loss included within the net incurred loss amount are presented in the following section reserving methodology we use combination of method to project ultimate loss for both long tail and short tail exposure which include paid development method the paid development method estimate ultimate loss by reviewing paid loss pattern and selecting paid ultimate loss development factor these factor are then applied to paid loss by applying them to accident year with further expected change in paid loss since the method doe not rely on case reserve it is not directly influenced by change in the adequacy of case reserve incurred development method the incurred development method is similar to the paid development method but it us case incurred loss instead of paid loss since this method us more data case reserve in addition to paid loss than the paid development method the incurred development pattern may be le variable than paid development pattern expected loss ratio method the expected loss ratio method multiplies premium by an expected loss ratio to produce ultimate loss estimate for each accident year this method may be useful if loss development pattern are inconsistent loss emerge very slowly or there is relatively little loss history from which to estimate future loss bornhuetter ferguson method the bornhuetter ferguson method using premium and paid loss is combination of the paid development method and the expected loss ratio method where the weight given to each method is the reciprocal of the loss development factor this method normally determines expected loss ratio similar to the method used for the expected loss ratio method the bornhuetter ferguson method using premium and incurred loss is similar to the bornhuetter ferguson method using premium and paid loss except that it us case incurred loss cape cod method the cape cod method is mechanically similar to the bornhuetter ferguson method with the difference being that the expected loss ratio estimate are determined based on weighting of the loss estimate that come from the paid incurred development method this method may be more responsive to recent loss trend than the bornhuetter ferguson method aig form table of content item note to consolidated financial statement insurance liability average loss method the average loss method multiplies projected number of ultimate claim by an estimated ultimate severity average loss for each accident year to produce ultimate loss estimate since projection of the ultimate number of claim are often le variable than projection of ultimate loss this method can provide more reliable result for reserve category where loss development pattern are inconsistent or variable to be relied on exclusively in updating our loss reserve estimate we consider and evaluate input from many source including actual claim data the performance of prior reserve estimate observed industry trend our internal peer review process including challenge and recommendation from our enterprise risk management group well the view of third party actuarial firm we use these input to improve our evaluation technique and to analyze and ass the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year by product line our analysis produce range of indication from various method from which we select our best estimate in determining the actual carried loss reserve we consider both the internal actuarial best estimate and numerous other internal and external factor including an assessment of economic condition including real gdp growth inflation employment rate or unemployment duration stock market volatility and change in corporate bond spread change in the legal regulatory judicial and social environment including change in road safety public health and cleanup standard change in medical cost trend inflation intensity and utilization of medical service and wage inflation trend underlying policy pricing term and condition including attachment point and policy limit change in claim handling philosophy operating model

earlier or later accident year more information about the date of occurrence becomes available to these reclassification are shown development in the respective year in the table below financial line business is primarily written on claim made basis while the majority of the worker compensation excess casualty other casualty and run off property and casualty line of business are written on an

underlying the related reserve also refer to the additional table presented after discussion of prior year development by line of business which reconciles the change in net ultimate to our overall prior year development and provides the reattribution of loss recovery for the covered line the reinsurance term of the adc were then used to identify the future claim payment for which will be

methodology worker compensation is an extremely long tail line of business with loss emergence extending for decade we generally use combination of loss development frequency severity and expected loss ratio method for worker compensation many of our primary casualty policy contain risk sharing feature including high deductible self insured retention or retrospective rating feature in addition to traditional insurance component these risk sharing program generally are large and complex comprising multiple product year and structure and are subject to amendment over time we group guaranteed cost and excess of deductible business separately and then further by state and industry subset to the extent that meaningful difference are determined to exist we also separately analyze certain subset of the portfolio that have unique characteristic government sub contractor account and construction wrap up business for excess of deductible business we also segment by size of deductible and whether the claim is handled by aig or an outside third party administrator tpa the proportion of large deductible business ha increased over time which ha slowed the reporting pattern of claim for guaranteed cost business expected loss ratio method generally are given significant weight only in the most recent accident year worker compensation claim are generally characterized by high frequency low severity and relatively consistent loss development from one accident year to the next we historically have been leading writer of worker compensation and thus have sufficient volume of claim experience to use development method we generally segregate california ca and new york ny business from the other state to reflect their different development pattern and changing percentage of the mix by state the claim development table above are impacted by two other significant initiative which offset each other in recent year we instituted claim strategy change and loss mitigation effort to accelerate settlement which we believe result in an overall reduction in claim cost this strategy resulted in an increase in paid loss along the latest diagonal relative to prior year in addition we have been reducing premium volume in recent year and shifting greater proportion of business to insured risk retention structure such high deductible policy these mix and volume change slowed paid and incurred development since excess of deductible claim will typically take longer to emerge and settle expected loss ratio method for business written in excess of deductible may be given significant weight in the most recent five accident year in the analysis we increased our tail factor estimate for state other than ny and ca for guaranteed cost business in recognition of longer medical development pattern that we have been seeing in recent year we reflected increase in legal cost we have seen across the portfolio particularly in california additionally over the year we have written number of very large account which include worker compensation coverage these account are generally individually priced by our actuary and to the extent appropriate the indicated loss based on the pricing analysis may be used to record the initial estimated loss reserve for these account aig form table of content item note to consolidated financial statement insurance liability prior year development during we recognized million of adverse prior year development in worker compensation business with higher claim development factor at older age tail factor for non california non new york and loss sensitive business in older accident year being offset by favorable emergence in recent year accident year wa adversely impacted by change in ceded reinsurance estimate for our defense base act dba business adverse development in recent year wa offset by an expansion of the definition of reimbursable war hazard claim by the government during we recognized million of favorable prior year development in worker compensation business particularly guaranteed cost business in the state of california and new york actual loss emergence during the year particularly for guaranteed cost business in these two state wa significantly le than expected on reported loss basis we did recognize some offsetting unfavorable development in our defense based act dba business that cover government contractor in and non military installation well from pennsylvania supreme court decision that overturned ruling that provided limitation on payment for certain permanent injury the protz decision during we recognized billion of unfavorable prior year development in primary worker compensation coverage primarily driven by the risk sharing program where we provide coverage in excess of large deductible for this excess of large deductible business in we observed actual loss emergence and development at significantly greater level than expected based on our previous experience in particular from loss in excess of million since these policy respond to larger claim the loss reporting pattern is much longer than observed in guaranteed cost worker compensation and it take several year to discern credible change in the pattern furthermore implementation of claim settlement and loss mitigation strategy over the past several year ha made the recent evaluation of data more challenging historical development pattern may not yet fully reflect these claim and mitigation activity during we refined our actuarial methodology by combining data across previously segregated underwriting portfolio to improve our ability to analyze the loss development trend and pattern that had been altered by the mix claim handling and loss mitigation change we have made during the last five year we also developed further segmentation by deductible size and other key parameter such claim handled by tpa staff and not our claim department result we determined that the loss emergence pattern had changed and lengthened significantly from our prior expectation and therefore we increased our loss development factor in addition for worker compensation policy with no deductible guaranteed cost we increased our tail factor for the all other state grouping to reflect the latest unfavorable experience in more mature accident year this change increased the ultimate loss by approximately million in we also reflected the increasing cost trend for legal and cost containment service especially in california recent trend in this sector have been unfavorable furthermore in the florida supreme court issued two separate ruling that have increased the potential liability for worker compensation claim in that state by undoing certain aspect of regulation in place since the castellanos ruling eliminated statutory cap on claimant attorney fee in certain case and the westphal ruling eliminated the week limitation on temporary total disability benefit also in the second quarter the florida court of appeal issued the mile decision declaring unconstitutional certain restriction on claimant paid attorney fee in in the second quarter we increased our worker compensation

particular may develop over an extended period of time and impact multiple accident year when they emerge the more standard type of claim are then separately analyzed based on attachment point band to recognize that the impact of the level of the attachment point can significantly impact the delay in loss reporting and development in our analysis loss capped at million were first analyzed using traditional loss development and expected loss ratio method and then this estimate wa used to derive the expected loss estimate for loss above million reflecting the expected relationship between the layer reflecting the attachment point and limit expected loss ratio method are generally used for at least the three latest accident year due to the relatively low credibility of the reported loss the loss experience is generally reviewed separately by attachment point the expected loss ratio used for recent accident year are based on the projected ultimate loss ratio for older year adjusted for rate change and loss trend prior year development during we recognized million of adverse development driven largely by construction defect and construction wrap claim where actual emergence wa significantly worse than expected and our updated analysis significantly increased the severity assumption and lengthened the claim reporting pattern to recognize the significant deterioration seen in recent calendar period we also increased the expected loss ratio assumption in recent accident year to reflect the high initial reported loss ratio for those year and the incidence of several unusually large claim during we recognized million of unfavorable prior year development driven in large part by emerging loss experience in accident year where frequency and severity to date ha exceeded initial expectation and is coinciding with increased loss severity in the underlying primary auto and general liability segment in addition we experienced increased development from claim related to construction defect and construction wrap business the majority of this experience came from accident year and prior during we recognized billion of unfavorable prior year development driven by continued higher than expected loss emergence due to increased frequency and severity in recent accident year for both automobile and general liability claim approximately million of the unfavorable development is attributable to cohort of commercial automobile claim identified in which continued to increase in severity in beyond what wa observed or reasonably expected in the most significant increase in incurred loss were for accident year and subsequent in particular the frequency and severity of loss event for accident year and subsequent showed significant step change from accident year and prior we therefore gave limited credibility to accident year and prior in selecting our expected loss ratio for and subsequent accident year due to this shift in loss pattern that is now more evident and credible after examining data result of the continued adverse emergence we have increased our loss trend assumption for general liability and automobile and increased our expected

increased our ultimate loss estimate for prior accident year by million this wa driven by reported loss development being greater than expected result of increased loss severity we revised our loss trend assumption which also contributed to increased estimate for the more recent accident year for older accident year we experienced increased loss development from construction defect claim and construction wrap business in we increased our ultimate loss estimate for prior accident year by million we increased our assumption about loss development and expected loss ratio based on the adverse actual versus expected loss emergence driven by increase in severity especially in the risk sharing excess of deductible program in addition our segmentation separately evaluated key structural driver recently identified in the data result we noted the unfavorable development that wa driven by construction defect claim which continue to increase in severity and which exhibit continued higher

for prior accident year by million majority of this development related to accident year where reported loss experience ha been emerging greater than expected driven by an increase in the frequency of large claim we have experienced severity trend in recent accident year that have been at much higher level than what ha been reflected in the historic data although we did see some sign of abatement during the second half of the year in we continued to observe increase in both the frequency and severity of claim occurring in accident year since the recent economic downturn these claim have significantly outpaced both our accident year loss ratio assumption made in and the pricing rate increase implemented during the same period result we recognized million of unfavorable development during we increased the expected loss ratio for recent accident year to reflect continued market deterioration in the trend observed in and the higher reported loss in very recent accident year medical malpractice during we recognized favorable loss development of approximately million loss emergence wa le than expected in older year due to several large case settling for le than we expected

product and nursing home business in certain jurisdiction have been exited entirely during we recognized million of unfavorable development in other casualty medical malpractice comprising primary and excess hospital and nursing home coverage this wa in reaction to continued increase in the frequency of unusually large claim in these class that drove the adverse actual versus expected loss emergence observed in based on the observed adverse emergence and it sustained level over the last several year we increased our expected incurred loss and loss ratio for accident year and subsequent to reflect the distinct step change in the loss ratio from accident year and prior other line during we recognized favorable loss development of approximately million largely due to our environmental

analysis to estimate asbestos and pre environmental loss reserve we primarily base our determination of these loss reserve on combination of ground up and top down analysis of historical claim and available insurance coverage nonetheless we believe that significant uncertainty remains to our ultimate liability for asbestos and environmental claim which is due to several factor including the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation and pollution event occurring undetected over many year leading to the potential for involvement of multiple policy period for individual claim claim filed under the non aggregate premise or operation section of general liability policy the number of insured seeking bankruptcy protection and the effect of prepackaged bankruptcy diverging legal interpretation and the difficulty in estimating the allocation of remediation cost among various party with respect to environmental claim loss reserve for asbestos and environmental claim can not be estimated using conventional reserving technique such those that rely on historical accident year loss development factor the method used to determine asbestos and environmental loss estimate and to establish the resulting reserve are continually reviewed and updated by management excess worker compensation excess worker compensation ha an extremely long tail and is one of the most challenging line of business from reserving perspective particularly when the excess coverage is provided above self insured retention layer the class is highly sensitive to small change in assumption for example in the rate of medical inflation or the longevity of injured worker which can have significant effect on the ultimate reserve cost estimate excess worker compensation business wa written over qualified self insurance by various division beginning in the in this business wa consolidated into one division where it continued writing business up until when it wa effectively put into runoff in this book of business the claim are not handled or administered by aig general insurance claim personnel but are administered by the client designated tpa however aig general insurance claim personnel maintain an oversight role over these tpas and claim loss and loss adjustment expense liability estimate for excess worker compensation exposure are subject to additional uncertainty due to the following claim settlement time is longer than most other casualty line due to the lifetime benefit that can be expected to payout on certain claim coverage statute that vary by state and future medical inflation cost are difficult to estimate for this business combination of traditional method paid and incurred loss development and non traditional method

their expiration aig form table of content item note to consolidated financial statement income tax assessment of deferred tax asset valuation allowance the evaluation of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and the need for valuation allowance requires to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified the more negative evidence that exists the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support conclusion that valuation allowance is not needed our framework for assessing the recoverability of the deferred tax asset requires to consider all available evidence including the nature frequency and amount of cumulative financial reporting income and loss in recent year the sustainability of recent operating profitability of our subsidiary the predictability of future operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset the carryforward period for the net operating loss capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards including the effect of reversing taxable temporary difference and prudent and feasible action and tax planning strategy that would be implemented if necessary to protect against the loss of the deferred tax asset in performing our assessment of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset under this framework we consider tax law governing the utilization of the net operating loss capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards in each applicable jurisdiction under tax law company generally must use it net operating loss carryforwards before it can use it foreign tax credit carryforwards even though the carryforward period for the foreign tax credit is shorter than for the net operating loss our federal consolidated income tax group includes both life company and non life company while the taxable income of our non life company can be offset by our net operating loss carryforwards only portion no more than percent of the taxable income of our life company can be offset by those net operating loss carryforwards the remaining tax liability of our life company can be offset by the foreign tax credit carryforwards accordingly we utilize both the net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards concurrently which enables to realize our tax attribute prior to expiration of december based on all available evidence it is more likely than not that the net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards will be utilized prior to expiration and thus no valuation allowance ha been established estimate of future taxable income including income generated from prudent and feasible action and tax planning strategy and any change to interpretation and assumption related to the impact of the tax act could change in the near term perhaps materially which may require to consider any potential impact to our assessment of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset such potential impact could be material to our consolidated financial condition or result of operation for an individual reporting period for the year ended december recent change in market condition including rising interest rate impacted the unrealized tax gain and loss in the life insurance company available for sale security portfolio resulting in deferred tax asset related to net unrealized tax capital loss the deferred tax asset relates to the unrealized loss for which the carryforward period ha not yet begun and such when assessing it recoverability we consider our ability and intent to hold the underlying security to recovery of december based on all available evidence we concluded that valuation allowance should be established on portion of the deferred tax asset related to unrealized loss that are not more likely than not to be realized for the year ended december we established million of valuation allowance associated with the unrealized tax loss in the life insurance company available for sale security portfolio all of which wa allocated to other comprehensive income for the year ended december recent change in market condition including rising interest rate impacted the unrealized tax gain and loss in the non life company available for sale security portfolio resulting in decrease to the deferred tax liability related to net unrealized tax capital gain of december we continue to be in an overall unrealized tax gain position with respect to the non life company available for sale security portfolio and thus concluded no valuation allowance is necessary in the non life company available for sale security portfolio for the year ended december we recognized net increase of million in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance associated with certain foreign subsidiary and state jurisdiction primarily attributable to current year activity aig form table of content item note to consolidated financial statement income tax the following table present the net deferred tax asset liability at december and on gaap basis december in million net consolidated return group deferred tax asset net deferred tax asset liability in accumulated other comprehensive income valuation

liability total aig net deferred tax asset liability deferred tax asset valuation allowance of consolidated federal income tax group at december and our consolidated income tax group had net deferred tax asset after valuation allowance of billion and billion respectively at december and our consolidated income tax group had valuation allowance of million and million respectively deferred tax asset foreign state and local at december and we had net deferred tax asset liability of million and million respectively related to foreign subsidiary state and local tax jurisdiction and certain domestic subsidiary that file separate tax return at december and we had deferred tax asset valuation allowance of billion and billion respectively related to foreign subsidiary state and local tax jurisdiction and certain domestic subsidiary that file separate tax return we maintained these valuation allowance following our conclusion that we could not demonstrate that it wa more likely than not that the related deferred tax asset will be realized this wa primarily due to factor such cumulative loss in recent year and the inability to demonstrate profit within the specific jurisdiction over the relevant carryforward period tax examination and litigation we file consolidated federal income tax return with our eligible subsidiary income earned by subsidiary operating outside the is taxed and income tax expense is recorded based on applicable and foreign law the statute of limitation for all tax year prior to ha expired for our consolidated federal income tax return we are currently under examination for the tax year through on march we received statutory notice of deficiency notice from the irs for year to the notice asserted that we owe additional tax and penalty for these year primarily due to the disallowance of foreign tax credit associated with cross border financing transaction the transaction that are the subject of the notice extend beyond the period covered by the notice and the irs ha administratively challenged the later period the irs ha also administratively challenged other cross border transaction in later year we have paid the assessed tax plus interest and penalty for to on february we filed complaint in the united state district court for the southern district of new york southern district seeking refund of approximately million in tax interest and penalty paid with respect to the taxable year we allege that the irs improperly disallowed foreign tax credit and that our taxable income should be reduced result of the restatement of our consolidated financial statement we also filed an administrative refund claim on september for our and tax year on august we filed motion for partial summary judgment related to the disallowance of foreign tax credit associated with cross border financing transaction in the southern district of new york the southern district of new york denied our summary judgment motion and upon aig appeal the court of appeal for the second circuit the second circuit affirmed the denial aig petition for certiorari to the supreme court from the decision of the second circuit wa denied on march result the case ha been remanded back to the southern district of new york for jury trial aig form table of content item note to consolidated financial statement income tax in january the party reached non binding agreement in principle on issue presented in the dispute and are currently reviewing the computation reflecting the settlement term the resolution is not final and is subject to various review the litigation ha been stayed pending the outcome of the review process we can provide no assurance regarding the outcome of any such litigation or whether binding compromised settlement with the party will ultimately be reached we currently believe that we have adequate reserve for the potential liability that may result from these matter accounting for uncertainty in income tax the following table present reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefit year ended december in million gross unrecognized tax benefit beginning of year increase in tax position for prior year decrease in tax position for prior year increase in tax position for current year lapse in statute of limitation settlement activity of discontinued operation gross unrecognized tax benefit end of year at december and our unrecognized tax benefit excluding interest and penalty were billion billion and billion respectively the activity for the year ended december is not material the activity for the year ended december and includes increase for amount associated with cross border financing transaction and the impact of settlement discussion with the irs related to certain other open tax issue unrelated to the cross border financing transaction with respect to cross border financing transaction the increase are the result of consideration of court decision upholding the disallowance of foreign tax credit claimed by other corporate entity not affiliated with aig in addition the year ended december reflects the agreement reached in the fourth quarter of by the party in the cross border financing dispute to pursue potential settlement at december and our unrecognized tax benefit related to tax position that if recognized would not affect the effective tax rate because they relate to such factor the timing rather than the permissibility of the deduction were million million and million respectively accordingly at december and the amount of unrecognized tax benefit that if recognized would favorably affect the effective tax rate were billion billion and billion respectively interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit are recognized in income tax expense at december and we had accrued liability of billion billion and billion respectively for the payment of interest net of the federal benefit and penalty for the year ended december and we accrued expense of million million and million respectively for the payment of interest and penalty the activity for the period ended december is primarily related to decrease in the expected federal benefit of interest due to the corporate tax rate reduction and to an increase in interest and penalty associated with cross border financing transaction we believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefit could decrease within the next month by much billion principally result of potential resolution or settlement of prior year tax item the prior year tax item include unrecognized tax benefit related to the deductibility of certain expense and matter related to cross border financing transaction
