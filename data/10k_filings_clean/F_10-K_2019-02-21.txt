mobility segment our mobility segment includes ford smart mobility llc fsm and our autonomous vehicle business ford credit segment the ford credit segment is comprised of the ford credit business on consolidated basis which is primarily vehicle related financing and leasing activity automotive segmentgeneralour vehicle brand are ford and lincoln in we sold approximately vehicle at wholesale throughout the world see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation item for discussion of our calculation of wholesale unit volume substantially all of our vehicle part and accessory are sold through distributor and dealer collectively dealership the substantial majority of which are independently owned at december the approximate number of dealership worldwide distributing our vehicle brand wa follows brandnumber of dealership at december lincoln combined do not depend on any single customer or customer to the extent that the loss of such customer would material adverse effect on our business in addition to the product we sell to our dealership for retail sale we also sell vehicle to our dealership for sale to fleet customer including commercial fleet customer daily rental car company and government we also sell part and accessory primarily to our dealership which in turn sell these product to retail customer and to authorized part distributor which in turn primarily sell these product to retailer we also offer extended service contract the worldwide automotive industry is affected significantly by general economic and political condition which we have little control vehicle are durable good and consumer have latitude in determining whether and to replace an existing vehicle the decision whether to purchase vehicle may be affected significantly by slowing economic growth geopolitical event and other factor including the cost of purchasing and operating car truck and suv and the availability and cost of financing and fuel we have seen in the united state europe and china in particular the number of car truck and suv sold may vary substantially from year to year the automotive industry is highly competitive business that ha wide and growing variety of product offering from growing number of manufacturer business continued our wholesale unit volume vary with the level of total industry demand and our share of that industry demand our wholesale unit volume also are influenced by the level of dealer inventory our share is influenced by our product are perceived in comparison to those offered by other manufacturer based on many factor including price quality styling reliability safety fuel efficiency functionality and reputation our share also is affected by the timing and frequency of new model introduction our ability to satisfy changing consumer preference with respect to type or size of vehicle well design and performance characteristic affect our sale and earnings significantly with other manufacturer the profitability of our business is affected by many factor including wholesale unit volume margin of profit on each vehicle sold which in turn is affected by many factor such market factor volume and mix of vehicle and option sold and net pricing reflecting among other factor incentive program cost of component and raw material necessary for production of vehicle cost for customer warranty claim and additional service action cost for safety emission and fuel economy technology and equipment high proportion of relatively fixed structural cost that small change in wholesale unit volume can significantly affect overall profitabilityour industry ha competitive pricing environment driven in part by industry excess capacity prior to it recent stabilization the decline in the value of the yen over the last several year also ha contributed significantly to competitive pressure in many of our market for the past several decade manufacturer typically have given price discount and other marketing incentive to maintain market share and production level competitive position the worldwide automotive industry consists of many producer with no single dominant producer certain manufacturer however account for the major percentage of total sale within particular country especially country of origin key competitor with global presence include fiat chrysler automobile general motor company groupe psa honda motor company hyundai kia automotive group renault nissan suzuki motor corporation toyota motor corporation and volkswagen ag group seasonality we manage our vehicle production schedule based on number of factor including retail sale unit sold by our dealership to their customer at retail and dealer stock level the number of unit held in inventory by our dealership for sale to their customer historically we have experienced seasonal fluctuation in the business with production in many market tending to be higher in the first half of the year to meet demand in the spring and summer typically the strongest sale month of the year backlog order we generally produce and ship our product on average within approximately day after an order is deemed to become firm therefore no significant amount of backlog order accumulates during any period raw material we purchase wide variety of raw material from numerous supplier around the world for use in production of our vehicle these material include base metal steel iron casting and aluminum precious metal palladium energy natural gas and plastic resin polypropylene we believe we have adequate supply or source of availability of raw material necessary to meet our need there always are risk and uncertainty with respect to the supply of raw material however which could impact

allocates to ford credit billion of commitment under our corporate credit facility in separate agreement with fce ford credit ha agreed to maintain fce net worth in excess of million no payment have been made pursuant to that agreement governmental standardsmany governmental standard and regulation relating to safety fuel economy emission control noise control vehicle recycling substance of concern vehicle damage and theft prevention are applicable to new motor vehicle engine and equipment manufactured for sale in addition manufacturing and other automotive assembly facility are subject to stringent standard regulating air emission water discharge and the handling and disposal of hazardous substance the most significant of the standard and regulation affecting are discussed below vehicle emission controlu requirement federal and california emission standard the federal clean air act imposes stringent limit on the amount of regulated pollutant that lawfully may be emitted by new vehicle and engine produced for sale in the united state pursuant to the clean air act california may establish it own vehicle emission standard which can be adopted by other state the environmental protection agency epa and the california air resource board carb have established tailpipe and evaporative emission standard for light and medium duty vehicle that become increasingly stringent through the model year thirteen state primarily located in the northeast and northwest have adopted the california standard compliance with both the federal and california standard can in some case be challenging both federal and california regulation require motor vehicle to be equipped with on board diagnostic obd system that monitor emission related system and component obd requirement become complex and challenging over time could lead to increased vehicle recall and warranty cost compliance with automobile emission standard depends in part on the widespread availability of high quality and consistent automotive fuel that the vehicle were designed to use fuel variable that can affect vehicle emission include ethanol content octane rating and the use of metallic based fuel additive among other thing legislative regulatory and judicial development related to fuel quality at both the national and state level could affect vehicle manufacturer warranty cost well their ability to comply with vehicle emission standard the california vehicle emission program also includes requirement for manufacturer to produce and deliver for sale zero emission vehicle zevs the current zev regulation mandate substantial annual increase in the production and sale of battery electric fuel cell and plug in hybrid vehicle through the model year by the model year approximately of manufacturer total california sale volume will need to be made of such vehicle compliance with zev rule could have substantial adverse effect on our sale volume and profit we are concerned that the market and infrastructure in california may not support the large volume of advanced technology vehicle that manufacturer will be required to produce especially if gasoline price remain relatively low we also are concerned about enforcement of the zev mandate in other state that have adopted california zev program where the existence of market for such vehicle is even le certain california is in the process of promulgating new zev regulation aimed at medium and heavy duty vehicle effective no earlier than the model year these rule which could entail significant cost and compliance challenge are also expected to include burdensome warranty and recall requirement business continued european requirement european union eu directive and related legislation limit the amount of regulated pollutant that may be emitted by new motor vehicle and engine sold in the eu stringent new stage emission standard took effect for vehicle registration starting in september and second phase introduced new laboratory test cycle for and emission in september these standard drive the need for additional diesel exhaust after treatment which add cost to and potentially impact the diesel advantage the mandatory real driving emission rde rule require manufacturer to conduct on road emission test using portable emission analyzer these on road emission test complement the laboratory based test in manufacturer began to reduce the divergence the regulatory limit that is tested in laboratory condition and the value of rde test conformity factor the cost associated with conducting the rde test and complying with the conformity factor are significant in december the european court of first instance ruled that the eu commission must decrease this divergence to zero within the next month such short lead time may result in our inability to sell product in the eu if we are unable to timely satisfy any new requirement it is unclear whether the european commission will appeal the court decision or change the base regulation regardless of the ultimate resolution the court second step for rde to further reduce the conformity factor becomes mandatory for new vehicle type approval by authority starting in january the rde in use surveillance rule were published in november and they further increase the stringency of emission requirement by allowing third party to conduct testing and defining process by which those third party may challenge product compliance with authority the wvta whole vehicle type approval regulation are adapted to cover increased market surveillance and the eu commission announced that in it will begin to discus air quality modeling scenario for the next step of emission standard post stage there is an increasing trend of city access restriction for internal combustion engine powered vehicle in particular in european city that do not meet air quality limit depending on city and country the condition for access will vary different emission limit or vehicle requirement which indirectly impact residual value and sale of internal combustion powered vehicle prior to restriction being agreed there might also be need to retrofit emission after treatment of vehicle there are also discussion in several european country to ban the registration of internal combustion powered vehicle in the future part of their plan to meet their country specific target part of the paris accord other national requirement many country in an effort to address air quality and climate change concern are adopting previous version of european or united nation economic commission for europe un ece mobile source emission regulation some country have adopted more advanced regulation based on the most recent version of european or regulation for example in december the china ministry of environmental protection mep finalized emission regulation based on european stage vi emission standard for light duty vehicle and evaporative emission and obd requirement the china stage vi standard incorporate two level of stringency stage one is slated for implementation by july and the more stringent stage two level is slated for implementation by july however the government ha encouraged the more developed city to pull ahead implementation the earliest implementation is expected early july canadian criterion emission regulation are largely aligned with requirement in october the canadian province of quebec passed legislation enabling regulation of zev mandate part of it climate change plan final regulation were published in december and came into effect in january quebec final regulation are more stringent than those in place in california and the other zev mandate state in november the province of british columbia announced plan to introduce legislation for zev mandate in the spring of in south america there is mix of regulation and process based on and eu standard brazil ha specific regulation for light vehicle emission proconve and obd based on standard and heavy vehicle emission based on euro not all country have adopted appropriate fuel quality standard to accompany the stringent emission standard adopted this could lead to compliance problem particularly if obd or in use surveillance requirement are implemented business continued global development in recent year epa and carb have increased their focus on the use of defeat device defeat device are element of design typically embedded in software that improperly cause the emission control system to function le effectively during normal on road driving than during an official laboratory emission test without justification they are prohibited by law in many jurisdiction and we do not use defeat device in our vehicle regulator around the world have increased scrutiny of automaker emission testing which ha led to number of defeat device settlement by various manufacturer epa is carrying additional non standard test part of it vehicle certification program carb ha also been conducting extensive non standard emission test which in some case have resulted in certification delay for diesel vehicle the eu accelerated effort to finalize it rde testing program are described in several european country including france and germany conducted non standard emission test and published the result in some case this supplemental testing ha triggered investigation of manufacturer for possible defeat device testing is expected to continue on an ongoing basis in addition plaintiff attorney are pursuing consumer class action lawsuit based on alleged excessive emission from car and truck which could in turn prompt further investigation by regulator vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas standardsu requirement light duty vehicle federal law requires that light duty vehicle meet minimum corporate average fuel economy cafe standard set by the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa manufacturer are subject to substantial civil penalty if they fail to meet the cafe standard in any model year after taking into account all available credit for the preceding three model year and expected credit for the five succeeding model year the law requires nhtsa to promulgate and enforce separate cafe standard applicable to each manufacturer fleet of domestic passenger car imported passenger car and light duty truck epa also regulates vehicle greenhouse gas ghg emission under the clean air act the vast majority of ghgs emitted by vehicle are the result of fuel combustion ghg emission standard effectively are fuel economy standard thus it is necessary for nhtsa and epa to coordinate with each other on their fuel economy and ghg standard respectively to avoid potential inconsistency in epa and nhtsa jointly promulgated regulation establishing the one national program of cafe and ghg regulation for light duty vehicle for the model year in epa and nhtsa jointly promulgated regulation extending the one national program framework through the model year these rule require manufacturer to achieve increasingly stringent standard reaching approximately mpg by the model year each manufacturer specific task depends on the mix of vehicle it sell the rule include the opportunity for manufacturer to earn credit for technology that achieve real world reduction and fuel economy improvement that are not captured by the epa fuel economy test procedure manufacturer also can earn credit for ghg reduction not specifically tied to fuel economy such improvement in air conditioning system the existing one national program standard will be difficult to meet if fuel price remain relatively low and market condition do not drive consumer to purchase electric vehicle and other highly fuel efficient vehicle in large number we are concerned about the commercial feasibility of meeting future model year ghg and cafe standard particularly the standard because of the many unknown regarding technology development market condition and other factor so far into the future the one national program rule provided for midterm evaluation process under which by april epa and nhtsa would evaluate their standard for model year in order to ensure that those standard are feasible and optimal in light of intervening event in april epa announced it intention to reconsider the ghg standard originally set for those model year reversing prior decision in august the federal government issued proposed rule to reduce the stringency of future ghg standard identifying eight potential scenario of alternate standard beginning with the model year it is expected that by the second quarter of epa and nhtsa will finalize their rulemaking for future ghg and fuel economy standard business continued california ha asserted the right to regulate motor vehicle ghg emission and other state have asserted the right to adopt the california standard under the one national program framework discussed above california and the other state had agreed that compliance with the federal program would satisfy compliance with any purported state ghg requirement for the model year thereby avoiding patchwork of potentially conflicting federal and state ghg standard in the wake of the federal government decision to reconsider the model year standard california ha taken the position that if there are any change to the federal standard it will return to enforcing it own state specific ghg standard in contrast the federal government ha taken the position that state ghg standard are preempted by federal law should california and the federal government remain at odds over ghg standard there is significant potential for litigation which in turn would give rise to regulatory uncertainty about future ghg and fuel economy standard such uncertainty would make it difficult for automobile manufacturer to engage in future product planning with confidence should california and other state be successful in enforcing state specific motor vehicle ghg rule the existence of separate state and federal ghg and fuel economy standard would impose significant cost on automobile manufacturer if any federal or state agency seek to impose and enforce fuel economy and ghg standard that are misaligned with market condition we likely would be forced to take various action that could have substantial adverse effect on our sale volume and profit such action likely would include restricting offering of selected engine and popular option increasing market support program for our most fuel efficient vehicle and ultimately curtailing the production and sale of certain vehicle such high performance car utility and or full size light truck in order to maintain compliance requirement heavy duty vehicle epa and nhtsa have jointly promulgated ghg and fuel economy standard for heavy duty vehicle generally vehicle over pound gross vehicle weight rating through the model year in our case the standard primarily affect our heavy duty pickup truck and van plus vocational vehicle such shuttle bus and delivery truck the heavy duty standard increase in stringency it may become more difficult to comply continuing to offer full lineup of heavy duty truck european requirement in december the eu approved regulation of passenger car emission with phase in period that limit the industry fleet average to maximum of gram per kilometer km using sliding scale the eu target slope based on vehicle weight this regulation provides different target for each manufacturer based on the respective average vehicle weight for it fleet of vehicle initially registered in calendar year limited credit are available for cycle technology eco innovation certain alternative fuel and vehicle with emission below km for period of time penalty system applies to manufacturer failing to meet the individual target pooling agreement between manufacturer are possible under certain condition starting in an eu industry target of km ha been set for which of manufacturer fleet ha to comply by of manufacturer fleet ha to comply outside of the eu switzerland for example ha introduced similar rule which began phasing in in july although the stringency of the industry average emission target is significantly higher in volatile market we face the risk of advance premium payment requirement if for example unexpected market fluctuation within quarter negatively impact our average fleet performance in separate legislation complementary measure have been mandated including requirement related to fuel economy indicator gear shift indicator tire pressure monitoring system low rolling resistance tire and more efficient low mobile air conditioning system the eu commission introduced in target for commercial light duty vehicle to be at an eu industry average of km starting in and km starting in with similar ruling in switzerland for multi stage vehicle our transit chassis cab the base manufacturer ford is fully responsible for the performance of the final up fitted vehicle the eu legislation for light commercial vehicle also includes penalty system super credit for vehicle below km granted between and and limited credit for off cycle eco innovation pooling etc similar to the passenger car regulation the eu is preparing to publish rule that require reduction of by for passenger car and light commercial van in compared to and in by for light commercial van and for passenger car compared to the eu commission will investigate the introduction of real driving and life cycle assessment element heavy duty vehicle will be addressed in separate regulation business continued the united nation developed new technical regulation for passenger car emission and this new world light duty test procedure wltp is focused primarily on better aligning laboratory and fuel consumption figure with customer reported figure the introduction of wltp in europe started in september and is likely to require update to labeling thereby impacting tax in country with tax scheme well the above mentioned fleet regulation for passenger car and light commercial vehicle cost associated with new or incremental testing for wltp could be significant some european country have implemented or are considering other initiative for reducing vehicle emission including fiscal measure and labeling to address country target associated with the paris accord for example the united kingdom france germany spain portugal and the netherlands among others have introduced taxation based on emission the eu requirement are likely to trigger further measure other country are considering ban on internal combustion engine vehicle registration in the future other national requirement the canadian federal government ha regulated vehicle ghg emission under the canadian environmental protection act beginning with the model year in october the canadian federal government published the final change to the regulation for light duty vehicle which maintain alignment with epa vehicle ghg standard for the model year the final regulation for heavy duty vehicle wa published in february the model year standard hold through the model year final regulation for the model year and beyond were published in may and are in line with requirement the china fuel consumption requirement us weight based approach to establish target specifies year over year target reduction and requires new energy vehicle nev mandated volume of plug in hybrid battery electric vehicle or fuel cell vehicle to generate credit equivalent to in and in china ha set the fuel consumption fleet average at and in the government is projecting further fuel consumption reduction in and is targeting the fuel efficiency target and nev mandate will impact the cost of vehicle technology in the future in south america brazil wa the first country to establish ghg reduction policy for light duty vehicle with spark ignition engine target had to be achieved for and must be maintained through additional tax reduction are available if further fuel efficiency target are achieved and penalty may be applied if the efficiency level are not maintained in december the next phase of the fuel efficiency program wa published and it includes light duty diesel and heavy duty vehicle other country in the region are considering similar approach with the inclusion of fuel efficiency labeling program in argentina and chile initiating discussion around ghg reduction business continued vehicle safetyu requirement the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of the safety act regulates vehicle and vehicle equipment in two primary way first the safety act prohibits the sale in the united state of any new vehicle or equipment that doe not conform to applicable vehicle safety standard established by nhtsa meeting or exceeding many safety standard is costly in part because the standard tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet emission and fuel economy standard second the safety act requires that defect related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaign manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicle if it determines the vehicle do not comply with safety standard should we or nhtsa determine that either safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicle the cost of such recall campaign could be substantial other national requirement the eu and many country have established vehicle safety standard and regulation and are likely to adopt additional or more stringent requirement in the future the european general safety regulation introduced un ece regulation which will be required for the european type approval process and will require the mandatory introduction of multiple active and passive safety feature with limited lead time eu regulator also are focusing on active safety feature such lane departure warning system electronic stability control and automatic brake assist globally government generally have been adopting un ece based regulation with minor variation to address local concern any difference between north american and un ece based regulation can add complexity and cost to the development of global platform vehicle and we continue to support effort to harmonize regulation to reduce vehicle design complexity while providing common level of safety performance several recently launched bilateral negotiation on free trade can potentially contribute to this goal new safety and recall requirement in china india and gulf cooperation council country also may add substantial cost and complexity to our global recall practice brazil ha set mandatory safety target and penalty are applied if these level are not maintained while tax reduction may be available for over performance in canada regulatory requirement are currently aligned with regulation however under the canadian motor vehicle safety act the minister of transport ha broad power to order manufacturer to submit notice of defect or non compliance when the minister considers it would be in the interest of safety in china new mandatory event data recorder regulation is under development that is more complex than requirement and in china malaysia and south korea mandatory call requirement have been drafted new car assessment program organization around the globe rate and compare motor vehicle in new car assessment program ncaps to provide consumer with additional information about the safety of new vehicle ncaps use crash test

brazil france india mexico russia romania south africa thailand the united kingdom and the united state item risk factor we have listed below not necessarily in order of importance or probability of occurrence the most significant risk factor applicable to ford long term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of fitness action we have announced fitness redesign plan to transform the operational fitness of our business by becoming more customer centric and adopting process that emphasize simplicity speed and agility efficiency and accountability we are working on major initiative part of our fitness redesign effort in addition to further improve our fitness and overall competitiveness we are leveraging relationship with third party including the recently announced alliance with volkswagen ag to develop commercial van and medium sized pickup for global market beginning early the goal of the alliance is to drive scale and efficiency and enable both company to share investment in vehicle architecture if our fitness action are not successful or are delayed we may not be able to materially lower cost in the near term or improve our competitiveness in the long term which could have an adverse effect on our profitability industry sale volume particularly in the united state europe or china can be volatile and could decline if there is financial crisis recession or significant geopolitical event because we like other manufacturer have high proportion of relatively fixed structural cost relatively small change in industry sale volume can have substantial effect on our cash flow and profitability industry vehicle sale are affected by overall economic and market condition if industry vehicle sale were to decline to level significantly below our planning assumption particularly in the united state europe or china the decline could have substantial adverse effect on our financial condition result of operation and cash flow for discussion of economic trend see the overview section of item risk factor continued ford new and existing product and mobility service are subject to market acceptance although we conduct extensive market research before launching new or refreshed vehicle and introducing new service many factor both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing product and service in the marketplace it take year to design and develop new vehicle or change an existing vehicle because customer preference may change quickly our new and existing product may not generate sale in sufficient quantity and at high enough price to be profitable offering vehicle and service that customer want and value can mitigate the risk of increasing price competition and declining demand but product and service that are perceived to be le desirable whether in term of price quality styling safety overall value fuel efficiency or other attribute can exacerbate these risk with increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet social medium and other medium mere allegation relating to quality safety fuel efficiency corporate social responsibility or other key attribute can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our product or service even where such allegation prove to be inaccurate or unfounded further our ability to successfully grow through investment in the area of mobility and electrification depends on many factor including advancement in technology regulatory change and other factor that are difficult to predict that may significantly affect the future of autonomous vehicle and mobility service rapid change to our industry including the introduction of new type of competitor who may posse technological innovation increase the significance that we are able to anticipate develop and deliver product and service that customer desire ford result are dependent on sale of larger more profitable vehicle particularly in the united state shift in consumer preference away from larger more profitable vehicle including truck and utility at level beyond our current planning assumption whether because of spiking fuel price decline in the construction industry government action or incentive or other reason could result in an immediate and substantial adverse effect on our result and financial condition ford may face increased price competition resulting from industry excess capacity currency fluctuation or other factor the global automotive industry is intensely competitive with manufacturing capacity far exceeding current demand according to the december report issued by ihs automotive the global automotive industry is estimated to have had excess capacity of about million unit in an increase of about million unit from the prior year industry overcapacity ha resulted in many manufacturer offering marketing incentive on vehicle in an attempt to maintain and grow market share these incentive historically have included combination of subsidized financing or leasing program price rebate and other incentive result we are not necessarily able to set our price to offset higher cost of marketing incentive commodity or other cost increase or the impact of adverse currency fluctuation including pricing advantage foreign competitor may have because of their weaker home market currency continuation of or increased excess capacity particularly for truck and utility could have substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation fluctuation in commodity price foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate can have significant effect on result resource intensive manufacturing operation we are exposed to variety of market risk including the effect of change in commodity price foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate we monitor and manage these exposure an integral part of our overall risk management program which recognizes the unpredictability of market and seek to reduce potentially adverse effect on our business change in commodity price from tariff or otherwise currency exchange rate and interest rate can not always be predicted hedged or offset with price increase to eliminate earnings volatility result significant change in commodity price foreign currency exchange rate or interest rate could have substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation see the overview section of item and item for additional discussion of currency commodity price and interest rate risk with global footprint ford result could be adversely affected by economic geopolitical protectionist trade policy or other event including brexit with the increasing interconnectedness of global economic and financial system financial crisis natural disaster geopolitical crisis or other significant event in one area of the world can have an immediate and material adverse impact on market around the world recent step taken by the government to apply and consider applying tariff on automobile part and other product and material have the potential to disrupt existing supply chain and impose additional cost on our business further other country could attempt to retaliate by imposing tariff that would increase the cost for to import our vehicle into such country risk factor continued concern persist regarding the overall stability of the european union given the diverse economic and political circumstance of individual european country these concern have been exacerbated by brexit hard brexit which would result in the united kingdom losing access to free trade agreement for good and service with the european union and other country would likely result in significant reduction in industry volume in the united kingdom increased tariff on import and export and delay at the border the total cost to of hard brexit not including currency exchange related effect could be million to billion in we have operation in various market with volatile economic or political environment and are pursuing growth opportunity in number of newly developed and emerging market these investment may expose to heightened risk of economic geopolitical or other event including governmental takeover nationalization of our manufacturing facility or intellectual property restrictive exchange or import control disruption of operation result of systemic political or economic instability outbreak of war or expansion of hostility and act of terrorism each of which could have substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation further the government other government and international organization could impose additional sanction that could restrict from business directly or indirectly in or with certain country or party which could include affiliate ford production well ford supplier production could be disrupted by labor dispute natural or man made disaster financial distress production difficulty or other factor work stoppage or other limitation on production could occur at ford or it supplier facility for any number of reason including result of dispute under existing collective bargaining agreement with labor union or in connection with negotiation of new collective bargaining agreement result of labor dispute in response to potential restructuring action plant closure result of supplier financial distress or other production constraint or difficulty or for other reason many component used in our vehicle are available only from single supplier and therefore can not be re sourced quickly or inexpensively to another supplier due to long lead time new contractual commitment that may be required by another supplier before ramping up to provide the component or material etc such single source supplier also could threaten to disrupt our production leverage in negotiation significant disruption to our production schedule could have substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation ford ability to maintain competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraint substantially all of the hourly employee in our automotive operation in the united state and canada are represented by union and covered by collective bargaining agreement these agreement provide guaranteed wage and benefit level throughout the contract term and some degree of income security subject to certain condition practical matter these agreement may restrict our ability to close plant and divest business substantial number of our employee in other region are represented by union or government council and legislation or custom promoting retention of manufacturing or other employment in the state country or region may constrain practical matter our ability to sell or close manufacturing or other facility pension and other postretirement liability could adversely affect ford liquidity and financial condition we have defined benefit retirement plan in the united state that cover many of our hourly and salaried employee we also provide pension benefit to non employee and retiree primarily in europe in addition we and certain of our subsidiary sponsor plan to provide other postretirement benefit opeb for retired employee primarily health care and life insurance benefit see note of the note to the financial statement for more information about these plan these benefit plan impose significant liability on and could require to make additional cash contribution which could impair our liquidity if our cash flow and capital resource were insufficient to meet any pension or opeb obligation we could be forced to reduce or delay investment and capital expenditure suspend dividend payment seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness economic and demographic experience for pension and other postretirement benefit plan discount rate or investment return could be worse than ford ha assumed the measurement of our obligation cost and liability associated with benefit pursuant to our pension and other postretirement benefit plan requires that we estimate the present value of projected future payment to all participant we use many assumption in calculating these estimate including assumption related to discount rate investment return on designated plan asset and demographic experience mortality and retirement rate we generally remeasure these estimate at each year end and recognize any gain or loss associated with change to our plan asset and liability in the year incurred to the extent actual result are le favorable than our assumption we may recognize substantial remeasurement loss in our result for discussion of our assumption see critical accounting estimate in item and note of the note to the financial statement risk factor continued ford vehicle could be affected by defect that result in delay in new model launch recall campaign or increased warranty cost government safety standard require manufacturer to remedy defect related to vehicle safety through safety recall campaign and manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicle if it determines that the vehicle do not comply with safety standard nhtsa enforcement strategy ha shifted to significant increase in civil penalty levied and the use of consent order requiring direct oversight by nhtsa of certain manufacturer safety process trend that could continue should we or government safety regulator determine that safety or other defect or noncompliance exists with respect to certain of our vehicle prior to the start of production the launch of such vehicle could be delayed such defect is remedied the cost of recall and customer satisfaction action to remedy defect in vehicle that have been sold could be substantial particularly if the action relate to global platform or involve defect that are identified year after production takata airbag inflator such recall and customer satisfaction action may relate to defective component we receive from supplier and our ability to recover from the supplier may be limited by the supplier financial condition furthermore launch delay recall action and increased warranty cost could adversely affect our reputation or market acceptance of our product discussed above under ford new and existing product and mobility service are subject to market acceptance ford may need to substantially modify it product plan to comply with safety emission fuel economy and other regulation that may change in the future the worldwide automotive industry is governed by substantial amount of government regulation which often differs by state region and country government regulation ha increased and proposal for additional regulation are advanced primarily out of concern for the environment including concern about global climate change and it impact vehicle safety and energy independence for example discussed above under item business governmental standard in the united state the cafe standard for light duty vehicle increase sharply to approximately mpg by the model year epa parallel emission regulation impose similar standard california zev rule also mandate steep increase in the sale of electric vehicle and other advanced technology vehicle through the model year the zev mandate is now being expanded to include medium and heavy duty vehicle and even more burdensome regulation are likely to follow in addition many government regulate local product content and or impose import requirement mean of creating job protecting domestic producer and influencing the balance of payment we are continuing to make change to our product cycle plan to improve the fuel economy of our petroleum powered vehicle and to offer more electrified vehicle with lower ghg emission there are limit on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvement over given time frame however primarily relating to the cost and effectiveness of available technology consumer acceptance of new technology and change in vehicle mix willingness of consumer to absorb the additional cost of new technology the appropriateness or lack thereof of certain technology for use in particular vehicle the widespread availability or lack thereof of supporting infrastructure for new technology and the human engineering and financial resource necessary to deploy new technology across wide range of product and powertrains in short time the current fuel economy and zev standard will be difficult to meet if fuel price remain relatively low and market condition do not drive consumer to purchase electric vehicle and other highly fuel efficient vehicle in large number increased scrutiny of automaker emission testing by regulator around the world ha led to new regulation more stringent enforcement program request for field action and or delay in regulatory approval the cost to comply with existing government regulation is substantial and additional regulation or change in consumer preference that affect vehicle mix could have substantial adverse impact on our financial condition and result of operation in addition number of government well non governmental organization publicly ass vehicle to their own protocol the protocol could change aggressively and any negative perception regarding the performance of our vehicle subjected to such test could reduce future sale court decision arising out of consumer and investor litigation could give rise to de facto change in the interpretation of existing emission law and regulation thereby imposing new burden on manufacturer for more discussion of the impact of standard on our global business see the governmental standard discussion in item business above risk factor continued ford could experience unusual or significant litigation governmental investigation or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defect in product perceived environmental impact or otherwise we spend substantial resource ensuring that we comply with governmental safety regulation mobile and stationary source emission regulation and other standard compliance with governmental standard however doe not necessarily prevent individual or class action which can entail significant cost and risk in certain circumstance court may permit tort claim even where our vehicle comply with federal and or other applicable law furthermore simply responding to actual or threatened litigation or government investigation of our compliance with regulatory standard whether related to our product or business or commercial relationship may require significant expenditure of time and other resource litigation also is inherently uncertain and we could experience significant adverse result in addition adverse publicity surrounding an allegation may cause significant reputational harm that could have significant adverse effect on our sale ford receipt of government incentive could be subject to reduction termination or clawback we receive economic benefit from national state and local government in various region of the world in the form of incentive designed to encourage manufacturer to establish maintain or increase investment workforce or production these incentive may take various form including grant loan subsidy and tax abatement or credit the impact of these incentive can be significant in particular market during reporting period for example most of our manufacturing facility in south america are located in brazil where the state or federal government have historically offered and continue to offer significant incentive to manufacturer to encourage capital investment increase manufacturing production and create job result the performance of our south american operation ha been impacted favorably by government incentive to substantial extent in brazil however the federal government ha levied assessment concerning our calculation of federal incentive we received and certain state have challenged the grant to of tax incentive by the state of bahia decrease in expiration without renewal of or other cessation or clawback of government incentive for any of our business unit result of administrative decision or otherwise could have substantial adverse impact on our financial condition and result of operation see note of the note to the financial statement for discussion of our accounting for government incentive and item legal proceeding for discussion of tax proceeding in brazil and the potential requirement for to post collateral operational system security system and vehicle could be affected by cyber incident we rely on information technology network and system including in vehicle system and mobile device some of which are managed by supplier to process transmit and store electronic information that is important to the operation of our business and our vehicle despite security measure we are at risk for interruption outage and breach of operational system including business financial accounting product development consumer receivables data processing or manufacturing process ii facility security system and or iii in vehicle system or mobile device such cyber incident could materially disrupt operational system result in loss of trade secret or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information compromise the privacy of personal information of customer employee or others jeopardize the security of our facility affect the performance of in vehicle system and or impact the safety of our vehicle cyber incident could be caused by malicious third party using sophisticated targeted method to circumvent firewall encryption and other security defense including hacking fraud trickery or other form of deception we our supplier and our dealer have been the target of these type of attack in the past and such attack are likely to occur in the future the technique used for attack by third party change frequently and may become more sophisticated which may cause cyber incident to be difficult to detect for long period of time our network and in vehicle system may also be affected by computer virus or breach due to the negligence or misconduct of employee contractor and or others who have access to our network and system significant cyber incident could harm our reputation and or subject to regulatory action or litigation and significant cyber incident involving or one of our supplier could impact our production capability we are subject to law rule and regulation in the united state and other country relating to the collection use and security of personal information of customer employee or others including law that may require to notify regulator and affected individual of data security breach regulatory action seeking to impose significant penalty and or legal action could be brought against in the event of data breach or perceived or actual non compliance with data protection or privacy requirement among these requirement is the european union general data protection regulation gdpr which came into effect on may risk factor continued ford credit access to debt securitization or derivative market around the world at competitive rate or in sufficient amount could be affected by credit rating downgrade market volatility market disruption regulatory requirement or other factor ford credit ability to obtain unsecured funding at reasonable cost is dependent on it credit rating or it perceived creditworthiness ford credit ability to obtain securitized funding under it committed asset backed liquidity program and certain other asset backed securitization transaction is subject to sufficient amount of asset eligible for these program well ford credit ability to obtain appropriate credit rating and for certain committed program derivative to manage the interest rate risk over time and particularly in the event of any credit rating downgrade market volatility market disruption or other factor ford credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchase or originates because of funding constraint the potential phase out of libor is one such risk that could cause market volatility or disruption in july the chief executive of the united kingdom financial conduct authority the fca which regulates libor announced that the fca intends to stop compelling bank to submit rate for the calculation of libor after it is unknown whether any bank will continue to voluntarily submit rate for the calculation of libor after or whether libor will continue to be published by it administrator based on these submission or on any other basis it is not possible to predict the effect of these change other reform or the establishment of alternative reference rate but the potential phase out of libor could adversely affect ford credit access to the capital market and cost of funding in addition ford credit may be limited in the amount of receivables it purchase or originates in certain country or region if the local capital market particularly in developing country do not exist or are not adequately developed similarly ford credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchase or originates if there is significant decline in the demand for the type of security it offer or ford credit is unable to obtain derivative to manage the interest rate risk associated with it securitization transaction significant reduction in the amount of receivables ford credit purchase or originates would significantly reduce it ongoing profit and could adversely affect it ability to support the sale of ford vehicle ford credit could experience higher than expected credit loss lower than anticipated residual value or higher than expected return volume for leased vehicle credit risk is the possibility of loss from customer or dealer failure to make payment according to contract term credit risk which is heavily dependent upon economic factor including unemployment consumer debt service burden personal income growth dealer profitability and used car price ha significant impact on ford credit business the level of credit loss ford credit may experience could exceed it expectation and adversely affect it financial condition and result of operation in addition ford credit project expected residual value including residual value support payment from ford and return volume for the vehicle it lease actual proceeds realized by ford credit upon the sale of returned leased vehicle at lease termination may be lower than the amount projected which would reduce the profitability of the lease transaction among the factor that can affect the value of returned lease vehicle are the volume of vehicle returned economic condition marketing program and quality or perceived quality safety fuel efficiency or reliability of the vehicle actual return volume may be influenced by these factor well by contractual lease end value relative to auction value each of these factor alone or in combination ha the potential to adversely affect ford credit profitability if actual result were to differ significantly from ford credit projection see critical accounting estimate in item for additional discussion ford credit could face increased competition from bank financial institution or other third party seeking to increase their share of financing ford vehicle no single company is dominant force in the automotive finance industry most of ford credit competitor in the united state use credit aggregation system that permit dealer to send through standardized system retail credit application to multiple finance source to evaluate financing option offered by these source also direct on line or large dealer group financing option provide consumer with alternative finance source and or increased pricing transparency all of these financing alternative drive greater competition based on financing rate and term competition from such institution and alternative finance source could adversely affect ford credit profitability and the volume of it retail business in addition ford credit may face increased competition on wholesale financing for ford dealer ford credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulation consumer or data protection regulation or other regulation finance company ford credit is highly regulated by governmental authority in the location in which it operates which can impose significant additional cost and or restriction on it business in the united state for example ford credit operation are subject to regulation and supervision under various federal state and local law including the federal truth in lending act consumer leasing act equal credit opportunity act and fair credit reporting act risk factor continued the dodd frank act directs federal agency to adopt rule to regulate the finance industry and the capital market and give the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb broad rule making and enforcement authority for wide range of consumer financial protection law that regulate consumer finance business such ford credit automotive financing business exercise of these power by the cfpb may increase the cost of impose additional restriction on or otherwise adversely affect company in the automotive finance business the cfpb ha authority to supervise and examine the largest

is subject to many uncertainty and the outcome of individual matter is not predictable with assurance see note of the note to the financial statement for discussion of loss contingency following is discussion of our significant pending legal proceeding product liability matterswe are defendant in numerous action in state and federal court within and outside of the united state alleging damage from injury resulting from or aggravated by alleged defect in our vehicle in many no monetary amount of damage is specified or the specific amount alleged is the jurisdictional minimum our experience with litigation alleging specific amount of damage suggests that such amount on average bear little relation to the actual amount of damage if any that we will pay in resolving such matter in addition to pending action we ass the likelihood of incident that likely have occurred but not yet been reported to we also take into consideration specific matter that have been raised claim but have not yet proceeded to litigation individual product liability matter which if resolved unfavorably to the company likely would involve significant cost would be described herein currently there are no such matter to report asbestos matter asbestos wa used in some brake clutch and other automotive component from the early along with other vehicle manufacturer we have been the target of asbestos litigation and result are defendant in various action for injury claimed to have resulted from alleged exposure to ford part and other product containing asbestos plaintiff in these personal injury case allege various health problem result of asbestos exposure either from component part found in older vehicle insulation or other asbestos product in our facility or asbestos aboard our former maritime fleet we believe that we are targeted more aggressively in asbestos suit because many previously targeted company have filed for bankruptcy or emerged from bankruptcy relieved of liability for such claim most of the asbestos litigation we face involves individual who claim to have worked on the brake of our vehicle we are prepared to defend these case and believe that the scientific evidence confirms our long standing position that there is no increased risk of asbestos related disease result of exposure to the type of asbestos formerly used in the brake on our vehicle the extent of our financial exposure to asbestos litigation remains very difficult to estimate and could include both compensatory and punitive damage award the majority of our asbestos case do not specify dollar amount for damage in many of the other case the dollar amount specified is the jurisdictional minimum and the vast majority of these case involve multiple defendant sometimes more than one hundred many of these case also involve multiple plaintiff and often we are unable to tell from the pleading which plaintiff are making claim against opposed to other defendant annual payout and defense cost may become significant in the future our accrual for asbestos matter includes probable loss for both asserted and unasserted claim environmental matter we have received notice under various federal and state environmental law that we along with others are or may be potentially responsible party for the cost associated with remediating numerous hazardous substance storage recycling or disposal site in many state and in some instance for natural resource damage we also may have been generator of hazardous substance at number of other site the amount of any such cost or damage for which we may be held responsible could be significant we have one environmental legal proceeding to which governmental authority is party and in which we believe there is the possibility of monetary sanction in excess of notice of violation to ford chicago assembly plant on august epa issued notice of violation to our chicago assembly plant epa alleges that the plant violated several requirement related to it air permit monetary sanction if any have not yet been determined legal proceeding continued class action in light of the fact that very few of the purported class action filed against in the past have ever been certified by the court class action in general we list those action that have been certified class action by court of competent jurisdiction and any additional purported class action that raise allegation substantially similar to an existing and certified class and ii likely would involve significant cost if resolved unfavorably to the company at this time other than described below we have no such purported class action filed against in re takata airbag product liability litigation economic loss track case against ford motor company on july ford

outside the scope of the legislation transit connect custom ruling on march custom and border protection cbp ruled that transit connects imported passenger wagon and later converted into cargo van are subject to the duty applicable to cargo vehicle rather than the duty applicable to passenger vehicle result of the ruling cbp is requiring ford to pay the duty upon importation of transit connects

equivalent gaap measure to aid investor in better understanding our financial result we believe that these non gaap measure provide useful perspective on underlying business result and trend and mean to ass our period over period result these non gaap measure should not be considered substitute for or superior to measure of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap these non gaap measure may not be the similarly titled measure used by other company due to possible difference in method and in item or event being adjusted company adjusted ebit most comparable gaap measure net

managed receivables most comparable gaap measure net finance receivables plus net investment in operating lease measure of ford credit total net receivables excluding unearned interest supplement and residual support allowance for credit loss and other primarily accumulated supplemental depreciation the measure is useful to management and investor it closely approximates the customer outstanding balance on the receivables which is the basis for earning revenue ford credit managed leverage most comparable gaap measure financial statement leverage ford credit debt to equity ratio adjusted to exclude cash cash equivalent and marketable security other than amount related to insurance activity and ii for derivative accounting the measure is useful to investor because it reflects the way ford credit manages it business cash cash equivalent and marketable security are deducted because they generally correspond to excess debt beyond the amount required to support operation and on balance sheet securitization transaction derivative accounting adjustment are made to asset debt and equity position to reflect the impact of interest rate instrument used with ford credit term debt issuance and securitization transaction ford credit generally repays it debt obligation they mature so the interim effect of change in market interest rate are excluded in the calculation of managed leverage revenueour automotive segment revenue is generated primarily by sale of vehicle part and accessory revenue is recorded when control is transferred to our customer generally our dealer and distributor for the majority of sale this occurs when product are shipped from our manufacturing facility this is not the case however with respect to vehicle produced for sale to daily rental car company with an obligation to repurchase the vehicle for guaranteed amount exercisable at the option of the customer these vehicle are accounted for operating lease with lease revenue and profit recognized over the term of the lease proceeds from the sale of vehicle at auction are recognized in revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the buyer management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued most of the vehicle sold by to our dealer and distributor are financed at wholesale by ford credit upon ford credit originating the wholesale receivable related to dealer purchase of vehicle ford credit pay cash to the relevant automotive legal entity in payment of the dealer obligation for the purchase price of the vehicle the dealer then pay the wholesale finance receivable to ford credit when it sell the vehicle to retail customer our ford credit segment revenue is generated primarily from interest on finance receivables net of certain deferred origination cost that are included reduction of financing revenue and such revenue is recognized over the term of the receivable using the interest method also revenue from operating lease is recognized on straight line basis over the term of the lease income is generated to the extent revenue exceed expense most of which are interest depreciation and operating expense transaction between our automotive and ford credit segment occur in the ordinary course of business for example we offer special retail financing and lease incentive to dealer customer who choose to finance or lease our vehicle from ford credit the cost for these incentive is included in our estimate of variable consideration at the later of the date the related vehicle sale to our dealer are recorded or the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated in order to compensate ford credit for the lower interest or lease payment offered to the retail customer we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to ford credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract with the dealer customer ford credit recognizes the incentive amount over the life of retail finance contract an element of financing revenue and over the life of lease contract reduction to depreciation see note of the note to the financial statement for more detailed discussion of transaction between our automotive and ford credit segment cost and expensesour income statement classifies our automotive segment total cost and expense into two category cost of sale and ii selling administrative and other expense we include within cost of sale those cost related to the development manufacture and distribution of our vehicle part and accessory specifically we include in cost of sale each of the following material cost including commodity cost freight cost warranty including product recall cost labor and other cost related to the development and manufacture of our product depreciation and amortization and other associated cost we include within selling administrative and other expense labor and other cost not directly related to the development and manufacture of our product including such expense advertising and sale promotion cost certain of our cost such material cost generally vary directly with change in volume and mix of production in our industry production volume often varies significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year quarterly production volume experience seasonal shift throughout the year including peak retail sale season and the impact on production of model changeover and new product launch annual production volume are heavily impacted by external economic factor including the pace of economic growth and factor such the availability of consumer credit and cost of fuel result we analyze the profit impact of certain cost change holding constant present year volume and mix and currency exchange in order to evaluate our cost trend absent the impact of varying production and currency exchange level we analyze these cost change in the following category contribution cost these cost typically vary with production volume these cost include material commodity warranty and freight and duty cost structural cost these cost typically do not have directly proportionate relationship to production volume these cost include manufacturing engineering spending related advertising and sale promotion administrative and selling and pension and opeb cost while contribution cost generally vary directly in proportion to production volume element within our structural cost category are impacted to differing degree by change in production volume we also have varying degree of discretion when it come to controlling the different element within our structural cost for example depreciation and amortization expense largely is associated with prior capital spending decision on the other hand while labor cost do not vary directly with production volume manufacturing labor cost may be impacted by change in volume for example when we increase overtime add production shift or add personnel to support volume increase other structural cost such advertising or engineering cost do not necessarily have directly proportionate relationship to production volume our structural cost generally are within our discretion although to varying degree and can be adjusted over time in response to external factor management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued we consider certain structural cost to be direct investment in future growth and revenue for example increase in structural cost are necessary to grow our business and improve profitability invest in new product and technology respond to increasing industry sale volume and grow our market share cost of sale and selling administrative and other expense for full year were billion our automotive segment material and commodity cost make up the largest portion of these cost and expense representing in about two third of the total amount structural cost are the largest piece of the remaining balance although material cost are our largest absolute cost our margin can be affected significantly by change in any category of cost key economic factor and trend affecting the automotive industrycurrency exchange rate volatility the federal reserve raised it policy interest rate four time in for total of nine increase since the tightening cycle began in late central bank in other developed market have also initiated or signaled the end of an extended period of monetary policy easing the related shift in capital flow have contributed to increased volatility for both developed and emerging market currency globally emerging market also face differing inflation backdrop and in some case political instability contributing to unpredictable movement in the value of their exchange rate this condition wa demonstrated by significant devaluation of currency value in turkey and argentina in in addition to direct impact on the financial flow of global automotive company currency movement can also impact pricing of vehicle exported to overseas market most notably in the case of the japanese yen in most market exchange rate are market determined and all are impacted by many different macroeconomic and policy factor and thus likely to remain volatile however in some market exchange rate are heavily influenced or controlled by government excess capacity according to ihs automotive an automotive research firm the estimated automotive industry global production capacity for light vehicle of about million unit exceeded global production by about million unit in in north america and europe two region where significant share of industry revenue is earned excess capacity percent of production wa an estimated and respectively in in china the auto industry also witnessed excess capacity at of production in manufacturer compete to capitalize on china future market potential according to production capacity data projected by ihs automotive global excess capacity condition could continue for several year at an average of about million unit per year during the period from to pricing pressure excess capacity coupled with proliferation of new product being introduced in key segment will keep pressure on manufacturer ability to increase price in north america the industry restructuring of the past few year ha allowed manufacturer to better match production with demand although japanese and korean manufacturer also have capacity located outside of the region directed to north america in the future chinese and indian manufacturer are expected to enter and european market further intensifying competition over the long term intense competition and excess capacity will continue to put downward pressure on inflation adjusted price for similarly contented vehicle in the united state and contribute to challenging pricing environment for the automotive industry in europe the excess capacity situation ha been exacerbated by the lack of reduction in existing capacity such that negative pricing pressure is expected to continue for the foreseeable future commodity and energy price change the price of oil declined since late driven by reduced expectation for near term demand growth in china and continued robust supply despite an extended agreement among oil producing nation to maintain modest output reduction oil price are expected to remain volatile and on lower long term trend than in prior cycle price for other commodity have been similarly volatile with some retreat from recent peak for many commodity used in the manufacturing of our vehicle while steel and aluminum have seen additional upward pressure related to the imposition of tariff which affected domestic price in well vehicle profitability our financial result depend on the profitability of the vehicle we sell which may vary significantly by vehicle line in general larger vehicle tend to command higher price and be more profitable than smaller vehicle both across and within vehicle segment for example in north america our larger more profitable vehicle had an average contribution margin that wa about of our total average contribution margin across all vehicle whereas our smaller vehicle had significantly lower contribution margin in addition government regulation aimed at reducing emission and increasing fuel efficiency zev mandate and low emission zone may increase the cost of vehicle by more than the perceived benefit to the consumer given the backdrop of excess capacity these regulation could dampen contribution margin management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued trade policy to the extent government in various region erect or intensify barrier to import or implement currency policy that advantage local exporter selling into the global marketplace there can be significant negative impact on manufacturer based in other market while we believe the long term trend will support the growth of free trade we have noted with concern recent development in number of region the imposition of tariff on steel and aluminum coming into the united state in had direct negative impact on cost for manufacturer in the market in asia pacific weak yen significantly reduces the cost of export into the united state europe and other global market by japanese manufacturer and over period of time contribute to other country pursuing weak currency policy by intervening in the exchange rate market this is particularly likely in other asian country such south korea we will continue to monitor and address developing issue around trade policy other economic factor although in recent month interest rate have risen mature market government bond yield and inflation have remained lower than expected at the same time government deficit and debt remain at high level in many major market the eventual implication of higher government deficit and debt with potentially higher long term interest rate may drive higher cost of capital over our planning period higher interest rate and or tax to address the higher deficit also may impede real growth in gross domestic product and therefore vehicle sale over our planning period management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued result of operation chart below show our full year net income attributable to ford and company adjusted ebit by segment net income attributable to ford and company adjusted ebit were driven by our automotive and ford credit segment mobility and corporate other expected were loss the year over year decline in net income wa primarily due to the lower automotive ebit the larger mark to market adjustment for global pension and opeb plan due to adverse financial market condition that occurred late in and personnel separation related action in north america south america and europe the lower automotive ebit fully explains the billion decline in company adjusted ebit compared with ford credit generated full year ebt of billion million higher than year ago and it best ebt in eight year ford credit ebt improvement wa led by favorable lease residual performance and favorable

investment is approximately one year and adjusted based on market condition and liquidity need we monitor our company cash level and average maturity on daily basis management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued in addition to our target for company cash we also target to maintain corporate credit facility discussed below for our automotive business of about billion to protect against exogenous shock we ass the appropriate long term target for total company liquidity which includes company cash and the automotive portion of the corporate credit facility to be at or above billion which is an amount we believe is sufficient to support our business priority and to protect our business at december we had billion of company liquidity we may reduce our company cash and liquidity target over time based on improved operating performance and change in our risk profile change in company cash in we began reporting company adjusted operating cash flow which includes automotive mobility corporate other and interest on debt cash flow well ford credit distribution prior to ford credit distribution were reported non operating cash flow in

amortization change in working capital ford credit distribution and all other and timing difference non operating item include separation payment other transaction with ford credit acquisition and divestiture change in automotive and other debt contribution to funded pension plan and shareholder distribution with respect to change in working capital in general we carry relatively low automotive segment trade receivables compared with our trade payable because the majority of our automotive wholesale are financed primarily by ford credit immediately upon sale of vehicle to dealer which generally occurs shortly after being produced in addition our inventory are lean because we build to order not for inventory in contrast our automotive trade payable are based primarily on industry standard production supplier payment term generally ranging between day to day result our cash flow tends to improve wholesale volume increase but can deteriorate significantly when wholesale volume drop sharply these working capital balance generally are subject to seasonal change that can impact cash flow for example we typically experience cash flow timing difference associated with inventory and payable due to our annual summer and december shutdown period when production and therefore inventory and wholesale volume are usually at their lowest level while payable continue to come due and be paid the net impact of this typically result in cash outflow from change in our working capital balance during these shutdown period in our cash flow wa lower than primarily driven by lower ebit in

strategy is to reduce the risk of our funded defined benefit pension plan including minimizing the volatility of the value of our pension asset relative to pension liability and the need for unplanned use of capital resource to fund the plan the strategy reduces balance sheet cash flow and income exposure and in turn reduces our risk profile we have made significant progress in implementing this strategy over the last several year for example we have limited liability growth by closing our funded plan to new participant and have reduced plan deficit through discretionary contribution going forward we expect to limit our pension contribution to offset ongoing service cost or meet regulatory requirement if any continue progressively re balancing asset to more fixed income investment with target asset allocation of about fixed income investment and growth asset which will provide better matching of plan asset to the characteristic of the liability thereby reducing our net exposure and evaluate strategic action to reduce pension liability such plan design change curtailment or settlementsworldwide our defined benefit pension plan were underfunded by billion at december an improvement of million from december primarily result of higher discount rate demographic and contribution offsetting lower asset return of the billion underfunded status at year end about billion is associated with our unfunded plan these are pay go with benefit paid from general company cash these unfunded plan primarily include certain plan in germany and defined benefit plan for senior management the weighted average discount rate increased basis point to at year end from at year end the non weighted average discount rate increased basis point to at year end from at year end asset

million in discretionary contribution in the united state from company cash to our global funded pension plan we also expect to make about million of benefit payment to participant in unfunded plan for combined total of about billion based on current assumption and regulation we do not expect to have legal requirement to fund our major plan in after we expect contribution to our global funded plan of about million to million per year limited to ongoing service cost our global funded plan are now fully funded in aggregate which is an important milestone demonstrating the effectiveness of our de risking strategy and our commitment to strong balance sheet for detailed discussion of our pension plan see note of the note to the financial statement return on invested capital we analyze

automotive ebit to improve from business unit perspective we expect north america china and europe where result were lower in to lead the potential ebit improvement driver of this would be the favorable effect of new product fitness initiative they gain greater traction and turnaround at least in part of the major factor that led to our lower china performance in offsetting these positive

accounting estimate requires to make assumption about matter that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate wa made and change in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimate that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have material impact on our financial condition or result of operation management ha discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of director in addition there are other item within our financial statement that require estimation but are not deemed critical defined above change in estimate used in these and other item could have material impact on our financial statement warranty and field service actionsnature of estimate required we provide warranty on the product we sell separately we also periodically perform field service action related to safety recall emission recall and other product campaign pursuant to these warranty and field service action we will repair replace or adjust all part on vehicle that are defective in factory supplied material or workmanship we accrue the estimated cost of both basic warranty coverage and field service action at the time of sale assumption and approach used we establish estimate for warranty and field service action obligation using patterned estimation model we use historical information regarding the nature frequency and average cost of claim for each vehicle line by model year we reevaluate our estimate of warranty and field service obligation on regular basis experience ha shown that initial data for any given model year may be volatile therefore our process relies on long term historical average until sufficient data are available actual experience becomes available we use the data to modify the historical average in order to ensure that the estimate is within the range of likely outcome we then compare the resulting accrual with present spending rate to ensure that the balance are adequate to meet expected future obligation based on this data we revise our estimate necessary warranty coverage vary therefore our warranty accrual vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of it sale for specific period of time and or mileage field service action are distinguishable from warranty in that they may occur in period beyond the basic warranty coverage period our best estimate of the obligation related to field service action includes expected future payment due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these factor change in our assumption could materially affect our financial condition and result of operation see note of the note to the financial statement for information regarding warranty and product recall related cost pension and other postretirement employee benefit nature of estimate required the estimation of our defined benefit pension and opeb plan obligation and expense requires that we make use of estimate of the present value of the projected future payment to all participant taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future event such demographic experience and health care cost increase plan obligation and expense are based on existing retirement plan provision no assumption is made regarding any potential future change to benefit provision beyond those to which we are presently committed in existing labor contract assumption and approach used the assumption used in developing the required estimate include the following key factor discount rate our discount rate assumption is based primarily on the result of cash flow matching analysis which match the future cash outflow for each major plan to yield curve based on high quality bond specific to the country of the plan benefit payment are discounted at the rate on the curve to determine the year end obligation expected long term rate of return on plan asset our expected long term rate of return considers various source primarily input from range of advisor for capital market return inflation bond yield and other variable adjusted for specific aspect of our investment strategy by plan historical return also are considered where appropriate the assumption is based on consideration of all input with focus on long term trend to avoid short term market influence salary growth our salary growth assumption reflects our actual experience long term outlook and assumed inflation inflation our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicator including real gross domestic product growth and central bank inflation target management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued expected

plan experience health care cost trend our health care cost trend assumption are developed based on historical cost data the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trend assumption are set at each year end and are generally not changed during the year unless there is major plan event such significant curtailment or settlement that would trigger plan remeasurement see note of the

been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported special item for the expected long term rate of return on asset is for plan unchanged from and for non plan down about basis point compared with year ago primarily reflecting an increased allocation to fixed income asset and lower consensus on capital market return expectation from advisor de risking strategy we employ broad global de risking strategy which increase the matching characteristic of our asset relative to our obligation funded status improves change in interest rate which directly influence change in discount rate in addition to other factor have significant impact on the value of our pension obligation and fixed income asset portfolio we continue to de risk our plan and increase the allocation to fixed income investment over time our funded status sensitivity to change in interest rate will continue to be reduced change in interest rate should result in offsetting effect in the value of our pension obligation and the value of the fixed income asset portfolio sensitivity analysis the december pension funded status and expense are affected by year end assumption sensitivity to these assumption may be asymmetric and are specific to the time period noted the effect of change in the factor which generally have the largest impact on year end funded status and pension expense are discussed below

taxesnature of estimate required we must make estimate and apply judgment in determining the provision for income tax for financial reporting purpose we make these estimate and judgment primarily in the following area the calculation of tax credit ii the calculation of difference in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purpose that will ultimately be reported in tax return well iii the calculation of interest and penalty related to uncertain tax position change in these estimate and judgment may result in material increase or decrease to our tax provision which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs assumption and approach used we are subject to the income tax law and regulation of the many jurisdiction in which we operate these tax law and regulation are complex and involve uncertainty in the application to our fact and circumstance that may be open to interpretation we recognize benefit for these uncertain tax position based upon process that requires judgment regarding the technical application of the law regulation and various related judicial opinion if in our judgment it is more likely than not that the uncertain tax position will be settled favorably to we estimate an amount that ultimately will be realized this process is inherently subjective since it requires our assessment of the probability of future outcome we evaluate these uncertain tax position on quarterly basis including consideration of change in fact and circumstance such new regulation or recent judicial opinion well the status of audit activity by taxing authority change to our estimate of the amount to be realized are recorded in our provision for income tax during the period in which the change occurred we must also ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset against future source of taxable income gaap requires reduction of the carrying amount of deferred tax asset by recording valuation allowance if based on all available evidence it is more likely than not defined likelihood of more than that all or portion of such asset will not be realized we presently believe that valuation allowance of million is required primarily related to deferred tax asset in various non operation we believe that we ultimately will recover the remaining billion of deferred tax asset we have assessed recoverability of these asset and concluded that no valuation allowance is required for these asset for additional information regarding income tax see note of the note to the financial statement management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued impairment of goodwill and long lived assetsnature of estimate required goodwill goodwill is subject to periodic assessment of impairment we test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or when an event occurs or circumstance change that indicate the asset may be impaired we ass qualitative factor to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount including goodwill if qualitative assessment indicates an impairment or we impair the asset of reporting unit then quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed if the carrying value of the reporting unit is above fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess nature of estimate required long lived asset we test our long lived asset group when change in circumstance indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable event that trigger test for recoverability include material adverse change in projected revenue and expense significant underperformance relative to historical and projected future operating result and significant negative industry or economic trend or when there is change in the asset grouping when triggering event occurs we measure recoverability using our internal assumption comparing projected undiscounted future cash flow to the carrying value of the asset group if the test for recoverability identifies possible impairment the asset group fair value is measured relying primarily on discounted cash flow method an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds it estimated fair value test for recoverability also is performed when management ha committed to plan to sell or otherwise dispose of an asset group and the plan is expected to be completed within year when an impairment loss is recognized for asset to be held and used the adjusted carrying amount of those asset is depreciated over their remaining useful life assumption and approach used goodwill and long lived asset we measure the fair value of reporting unit or asset group based on market price the amount for which the asset could be sold to third party when available when market price are not available we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit or asset group using the income approach and or the market approach the income approach us cash flow projection inherent in our development of cash flow projection are assumption and estimate derived from review of our operating result business plan forecast expected growth rate and cost of capital similar to those market participant would use to ass fair value we also make certain assumption about future economic condition and other data many of the factor used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and these assumption and estimate may change in future period change in assumption or estimate can materially affect the fair value measurement of reporting unit or asset group and therefore can affect the test result the following are key assumption we use in making cash flow projection business projection we make assumption about the demand for our product in the marketplace theseassumptions drive our planning assumption for volume mix and pricing we also make assumption about our cost level capacity utilization cost performance etc these projection are derived using our internal business plan forecast that are updated at least annually and reviewed by our board of director long term growth rate growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business and is added to the present value of the debt free interim cash flow the growth rate is the expected rate at which business unit earnings stream is projected to grow beyond the planning period discount rate when measuring possible impairment future cash flow are discounted at rate that is consistent with weighted average cost of capital that we anticipate potential market participant would use weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall risk adjusted pre tax rate of return expected by equity and debt holder of business enterprise economic projection assumption regarding general economic condition are included in and affect our assumption regarding industry sale and pricing estimate for our vehicle these macro economic assumption include but are not limited to industry sale volume inflation interest rate price of raw material commodity and foreign currency exchange rate the market approach is another method for measuring the fair value of reporting unit or asset group this approach relies on the market value market capitalization of company that are engaged in the same or similar line of business in addition to the extent available we will also consider third party valuation of our long lived asset that were prepared for other business purpose management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued goodwill related to our emerging business is assessed based on each entity performance compared to metric established at the time the entity wa purchased in our mobility segment goodwill in our chariot subsidiary of million wa fully impaired during the fourth quarter of result of the decision to cease operation during we embarked on comprehensive strategy aimed at strengthening the competitive position and profitability of our operation part of this process we are accelerating several key fitness action aimed at reducing structural cost while at the same time consulting with our key stakeholder and partner with regard to fundamental redesign of our operation this redesign will include change to the company vehicle portfolio expanding offering and volume in it most profitable growth vehicle segment while improving or exiting le profitable vehicle line and addressing underperforming market against this backdrop we determined that there were triggering event related to our ford asia pacific china europe and south america business unit and tested our long lived asset for impairment using our internal economic and business projection well third party valuation of certain long lived asset we determined that the carrying value of the long lived asset in these business unit wa recoverable at december if in future quarter our economic or business projection were to change result of our plan or change in the business environment or if there wa significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which long lived asset is being used we would undertake additional testing appropriate which could result in an impairment of long lived asset allowance for credit lossesthe allowance for credit loss represents ford credit estimate of the probable credit loss inherent in finance receivables and operating lease of the balance sheet date the adequacy of ford credit allowance for credit loss is assessed quarterly and the assumption and model used in establishing the allowance are evaluated regularly because credit loss can vary substantially over time estimating credit loss requires number of assumption about matter that are uncertain see note of the note to the financial statement for more information regarding allowance for credit loss nature of estimate required ford credit estimate the probable credit loss inherent in finance receivables and operating lease based on several factor consumer portfolio ford credit estimate the allowance for credit loss on consumer receivables and on operating lease using combination of measurement model and management judgment the model consider factor such historical trend in credit loss and recovery including key metric such delinquency repossession and bankruptcy the composition of ford credit present portfolio including vehicle brand term risk evaluation and new used vehicle trend in historical used vehicle value and economic condition estimate from these model rely on historical information and may not fully reflect loss inherent in the present portfolio therefore ford credit may adjust the estimate to reflect management judgment regarding observable change in recent economic trend and condition portfolio composition and other relevant factor assumption used ford credit allowance for credit loss is based on it assumption regarding frequency the number of finance receivables and operating lease contract that are expected to default over the loss emergence period lep measured repossession repossession ratio reflects the number of finance receivables and operating lease contract that we expect will default over period of time divided by the average number of contract outstanding and loss severity the expected difference between the amount customer owes when the finance contract is charged off and the amount received net of expense from selling the repossessed vehicle collective allowance for credit loss the collective allowance is evaluated primarily using collective loss to receivables ltr model that based on historical experience indicates credit loss have been incurred in the portfolio even though the particular account that are uncollectible can not be specifically identified the ltr model is based on the most recent year of history an ltr for each product is calculated by dividing credit loss charge offs net of recovery by average net finance receivables or average net investment in operating lease excluding unearned interest supplement and residual support allowance for credit loss and other primarily accumulated supplemental depreciation the average ltr that is calculated for each product is multiplied by the end of period balance for that given product management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued ford credit largest market also use loss projection model to estimate loss inherent in the portfolio the loss projection model applies recent monthly performance metric stratified by contract type retail or lease contract term month and risk rating to ford credit active portfolio to estimate the loss that have been incurred the lep is an assumption within ford credit model and represents the average amount of time between when loss event first occurs to when it is charged off this time period start when the consumer begin to experience financial difficulty it is evidenced typically through delinquency before eventually resulting in charge off the lep is multiplier in the calculation of the collective consumer allowance for credit loss for account greater than day past due the uncollectible portion is charged off such that the remaining recorded investment is equal to the estimated fair value of the collateral le cost to sell specific allowance for impaired receivables consumer receivables involved in troubled debt restructurings are specifically assessed for impairment specific allowance is estimated based on the present value of the expected future cash flow of the receivable discounted at the contract original effective interest rate or the fair value of any collateral adjusted for estimated cost to sell after establishing the collective and specific allowance for credit loss if ford credit management belief the allowance doe not reflect all loss inherent in the portfolio due to change in recent economic trend and condition or other relevant factor an adjustment is made based on management judgment sensitivity analysis change in the assumption used to derive frequency and severity would affect the allowance for credit loss the effect of the indicated increase decrease in the assumption for ford credit ford and lincoln retail financing and operating lease portfolio is follows in million assumption basis point change increase decrease frequency repossession ratio bps loss severity per unit non consumer portfolio ford credit estimate the allowance for credit loss for non consumer receivables based on historical ltr ratio expected future cash flow and the fair value of collateral collective allowance for credit loss ford credit estimate an allowance for non consumer receivables that are not specifically identified impaired using an ltr model for each financing product based on historical experience this ltr is an average of the most recent historical experience and is calculated consistent with the consumer receivables ltr approach all account that are specifically identified impaired are excluded from the calculation of the non specific or collective allowance specific allowance for impaired receivables dealer financing is evaluated by segmenting individual loan by the risk characteristic of the loan such the amount of the loan the nature of the collateral and the financial status of the debtor the loan are analyzed to determine whether individual loan are impaired and specific allowance is estimated based on the present value of the expected future cash flow of the receivable discounted at the loan original effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral adjusted for estimated cost to sell after establishing the collective and specific allowance for credit loss if ford credit management belief the allowance doe not reflect all loss inherent in the portfolio due to change in recent economic trend and condition or other relevant factor an adjustment is made based on management judgment change in ford credit assumption affect the ford credit interest operating and other expense on our income statement and the allowance for credit loss contained within ford credit finance receivables net and net investment in operating lease on our balance sheet accumulated depreciation on vehicle subject to operating leasesaccumulated depreciation on vehicle subject to operating lease reduces the value of the leased vehicle in ford credit operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their expected residual value at the end of the lease term management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued ford credit monitor residual value each month and it review the adequacy of accumulated depreciation on quarterly basis if ford credit belief that the expected residual value for it vehicle have changed it revise depreciation to ensure that net investment in operating lease equal to the acquisition value of the vehicle le accumulated depreciation will be adjusted to reflect ford credit revised estimate of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term such adjustment to depreciation expense would result in change in the depreciation rate of the vehicle subject to operating lease and are recorded prospectively on straight line basis each lease customer ha the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer nature of estimate required each operating lease in ford credit portfolio represents vehicle it owns that ha been leased to customer at the time ford credit purchase lease it establishes an expected residual value for the vehicle ford credit estimate the expected residual value by evaluating recent auction value return volume for it leased vehicle industrywide used vehicle price marketing incentive plan and vehicle quality data assumption used ford credit accumulated depreciation on vehicle subject to operating lease is based on assumption regarding auction value ford credit projection of the market value of the vehicle when sold at the end of the lease and return volume ford credit projection of the number of vehicle that will be returned at lease end see note of the note to the financial statement for more information regarding accumulated depreciation on vehicle subject to operating lease sensitivity analysis for returned vehicle ford credit face risk that the amount it obtains from the vehicle sold at auction will be le than it estimate of the expected residual value for the vehicle the impact of the change in assumption on future auction value and return volume would increase or decrease accumulated supplemental depreciation and depreciation expense over the remaining term of the operating lease the effect of the indicated increase decrease in the assumption for ford credit ford and lincoln operating lease portfolio is follows in million assumption basis pointchange increase decrease future auction value bps volume adjustment to the amount of accumulated supplemental depreciation on operating lease would be reflected on our balance sheet net investment in operating lease and on the income statement in ford credit interest operating and other expense management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued accounting standard issued but not yet adoptedthe financial accounting standard board fasb ha

aggregate contractual obligationswe are party to many contractual obligation involving commitment to make payment to third party most of these are debt obligation incurred by our ford credit segment long term debt may have fixed or variable interest rate for long term debt with variable rate interest we estimate the future interest payment based on projected market interest rate for various floating rate benchmark received from third party in addition part of our normal business practice we enter into contract with supplier for purchase of certain raw material component and service to facilitate adequate supply of these material and service these arrangement may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirement purchase obligation are defined off balance sheet agreement to

which can not reasonably be estimated for additional information regarding operating lease obligation pension and opeb obligation and long term debt see note and respectively of the note to the financial statement quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskoverviewwe are exposed to variety of market and other risk including the effect of change in foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate well risk to availability of funding source hazard event and specific asset risk these risk affect our automotive and ford credit segment differently we monitor and manage these exposure an integral part of our overall risk management program which includes regular report to central management committee the global risk management committee grmc the grmc is chaired by our chief financial officer and the committee includes our treasurer our corporate controller and other member of senior management our automotive and ford credit segment are exposed to liquidity risk including the possibility of having to curtail business or being unable to meet financial obligation they come due because funding source may be reduced or become unavailable our plan is to maintain funding source to ensure liquidity through variety of economic or business cycle discussed in greater detail in item our funding source include sale of receivables in securitizations and other structured financing unsecured debt issuance equity and equity linked issuance and bank borrowing we are exposed to variety of insurable risk such loss or damage to property liability claim and employee injury we protect against these risk through the purchase of commercial insurance that is designed to protect above our self insured retention against event that could generate significant loss direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategy resides with our treasurer office and is governed by written policy and procedure separation of duty is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trade the transaction of derivative and the settlement of cash flow regular audit are conducted to ensure that appropriate control are in place and that they remain effective in addition our market risk exposure and our use of derivative to manage these exposure are approved by the grmc and reviewed by the audit committee of our board of director in accordance with our corporate risk management policy we use derivative instrument when available such forward contract swap and option that economically hedge certain exposure foreign currency commodity and interest rate we do not use derivative contract for trading market making or speculative purpose in certain instance we forgo hedge accounting and in certain other instance our derivative do not qualify for hedge accounting either situation result in unrealized gain and loss that are recognized in income for additional information on our derivative see note of the note to the financial statement the market and counterparty risk of our automotive and ford credit segment are discussed and quantified below automotive market riskour automotive segment frequently ha expenditure and receipt denominated in foreign currency including the following purchase and sale of finished vehicle and production part debt and other payable subsidiary dividend and investment in foreign operation these expenditure and receipt create exposure to change in exchange rate we also are exposed to change in price of commodity used in the production of our vehicle and change in interest rate foreign currency risk commodity risk and interest rate risk are measured and quantified using model to evaluate the sensitivity of market value to instantaneous parallel shift in rate and or price foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial result could be worse than planned because of change in currency exchange rate accordingly our normal practice is to use derivative instrument when available to hedge our economic exposure with respect to forecasted revenue and cost asset liability and firm commitment denominated in certain foreign currency in our hedging action we use derivative instrument commonly used by corporation to reduce foreign exchange risk forward contract quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk continued the net fair value of foreign exchange forward contract including adjustment for credit risk of december wa liability of million compared with an asset of million of december the potential decrease in fair value from adverse change in the underlying exchange rate in dollar term would have been billion at december compared with billion at december the sensitivity analysis presented is hypothetical and assumes foreign exchange rate change are instantaneous and adverse across all currency in reality foreign exchange rate move in different magnitude and at different time and any change in fair value would generally be offset by change in the underlying exposure see note of the note to the financial statement for more information regarding our foreign currency exchange contract commodity price risk commodity price risk is the possibility that our financial result could be worse than planned because of change in the price of commodity used in the production of motor vehicle such base metal steel copper and aluminum precious metal palladium energy natural gas and electricity and plastic resin polypropylene accordingly our normal practice is to use derivative instrument when available to hedge the price risk with respect to forecasted purchase of certain commodity that we can economically hedge primarily base metal and precious metal in our hedging action we use derivative instrument commonly used by corporation to reduce commodity price risk financially settled forward contract the extent to which we hedge is also impacted by our ability to achieve designated hedge accounting the net fair value of commodity forward contract including adjustment for credit risk of december wa an asset of million compared with liability of million of december the potential decrease in fair value from adverse change in the underlying commodity price in dollar term would be million at december compared with million at december in addition our purchasing organization with guidance from the grmc appropriate negotiates contract to ensure continuous supply of raw material in some case these contract stipulate minimum purchase amount and specific price and therefore play role in managing price risk interest rate risk interest rate risk relates to the loss we could incur in our automotive segment investment portfolio due to change in interest rate our interest rate sensitivity analysis on the investment portfolio includes cash and cash equivalent and net marketable security at december we had billion in our automotive segment investment portfolio compared to billion at december we invest the portfolio in security of various type and maturity the value of which are subject to fluctuation in interest rate the investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guideline to maintain liquidity minimize risk and earn reasonable return on the short term investment in investing our automotive cash safety of principal is the primary objective and risk adjusted return is the secondary objective at any time rise in interest rate could have material adverse impact on the fair value of our portfolio assuming hypothetical increase in interest rate of one percentage point the value of our portfolio would be reduced by about million calculated of december this compare to million calculated of december while these are our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario actual result could differ from those projected the sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate change are instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve in reality interest rate change of this magnitude are rarely instantaneous or parallel quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk continued ford credit market risk market risk for ford credit is the possibility that change in interest and currency exchange rate will adversely affect cash flow and economic value interest rate risk generally ford credit asset and the related debt have different re pricing period and consequently respond differently to change in interest rate ford credit asset consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and operating lease contract and floating rate wholesale receivables fixed rate retail installment sale and operating lease contract generally require customer to make equal monthly payment over the life of the contract wholesale receivables are originated to finance new and used vehicle held in dealer inventory and generally require dealer to pay floating rate debt consists primarily of short and long term unsecured and securitized debt ford credit term debt instrument are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payment over the life of the instrument and single principal payment at maturity ford credit interest rate risk management objective is to reduce volatility in it cash flow and volatility in it economic value from change in interest rate based on an established risk tolerance that may vary by market ford credit us economic value sensitivity analysis and re pricing gap analysis to evaluate potential long term effect of change in interest rate it then enters into interest rate swap to convert portion of it floating rate debt to fixed or it fixed rate debt to floating to ensure that ford credit exposure fall within the established tolerance ford credit also us pre tax cash flow sensitivity analysis to monitor the level of near term cash flow exposure the pre tax cash flow sensitivity analysis measure the change in expected cash flow associated with ford credit interest rate sensitive asset liability and derivative financial instrument from hypothetical change in interest rate over twelve month horizon ford credit asset liability committee review the re pricing mismatch and exposure every month and approves interest rate swap required to maintain exposure within approved threshold prior to execution to provide quantitative measure of the sensitivity of it pre tax cash flow to change in interest rate ford credit us interest rate scenario that assume hypothetical instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in all interest rate across all maturity parallel shift well base case that assumes that all interest rate remain constant at existing level in reality interest rate change are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rate could move more or le than the one percentage point assumed in ford credit analysis result the actual impact to pre tax cash flow could be higher or lower than the result detailed in the table below these interest rate scenario are purely hypothetical and do not represent ford credit view of future interest rate movement under these interest rate scenario ford credit expects more asset than debt and liability to re price in the next twelve month other thing being equal this mean that during period of rising interest rate the interest earned on ford credit asset will increase more than the interest paid on ford credit debt thereby initially increasing ford credit pre tax cash flow during period of falling interest rate ford credit would expect it pre tax cash flow to initially decrease ford credit pre tax cash flow sensitivity to interest rate movement is highlighted in the table below pre tax cash flow sensitivity at december wa follows in million pre tax cash flow sensitivity percentage point instantaneous increase in interest rate percentage point instantaneous decrease in interest rate _____ pre tax cash flow sensitivity given one percentage point decrease in interest rate requires an assumption of negative interest rate in market where existing interest rate are below one percent while the sensitivity analysis presented is ford credit best estimate of the impact of the specified assumed interest rate scenario it actual result could differ from those projected the model ford credit us to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumption embedded in the model are assumption regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal refinancing of maturing debt replacement of maturing derivative exercise of option embedded in debt and derivative and predicted repayment of retail installment sale and lease contract ahead of contractual maturity ford credit repayment projection ahead of contractual maturity are based on historical experience if interest rate or other factor change ford credit actual prepayment experience could be different than projected quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk continued foreign currency risk ford credit policy is to minimize exposure to change in currency exchange rate to meet funding objective ford credit borrows in variety of currency principally dollar canadian dollar euro sterling and renminbi ford credit face exposure to currency exchange rate if mismatch exists between the currency of receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables when possible receivables are funded with debt in the same currency minimizing exposure to exchange rate movement when different currency is used ford credit may use foreign currency swap and foreign currency forward to convert substantially all of it foreign currency debt obligation to the local country currency of the receivables result of this policy ford credit belief it market risk exposure relating to change in currency exchange rate at december is insignificant derivative fair value the net fair value of ford credit derivative financial instrument at december wa an asset of million compared to an asset of million at december counterparty risk counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or derivative contract we enter into master agreement with counterparties that allow netting of certain exposure in order to manage this risk exposure primarily relate to investment in fixed income instrument and derivative contract used for managing interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risk we together with ford credit establish exposure limit for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive allowing to take risk mitigation action before risk become loss exposure limit are established based on our overall risk tolerance which is calculated from counterparty credit rating and market based credit default cd spread the exposure limit are lower for smaller and lower rated counterparties counterparties that have relatively higher cd spread and for longer dated exposure our exposure are monitored on regular basis and included in periodic report to our treasurer substantially all of our counterparty exposure are with counterparties that have an investment grade rating investment grade is our guideline for minimum counterparty long term rating item financial statement and supplementary data the report of independent registered public accounting firm our financial statement the accompanying note to the financial statement and the

within our pension plan using various valuation method and prioritize the use of observable input the use of observable and unobservable input and their significance in measuring fair value are reflected in our fair value hierarchy level input include quoted price for identical instrument and are the most observable level input include quoted price for similar instrument and observable input such interest rate currency exchange rate and yield curve level input include data not observable in the market and reflect management judgment about the assumption market participant would use in pricing the instrumentsfixed income security equity commingled fund derivative financial instrument and alternative asset are remeasured and presented within our financial statement at fair value on recurring basis finance receivables and debt are measured at fair value for the purpose of disclosure other asset and liability are measured at fair value on nonrecurring basis transfer into and transfer out of the hierarchy level are recognized if they had taken place at the end of the reporting period valuation methodfixed income security fixed income security primarily include government security government agency security corporate bond and asset backed security we generally measure the fair value using price obtained from pricing service or quote from dealer that make market in such security pricing method and input to valuation model used by the pricing service depend on the security type asset class where possible fair value are generated using market input including quoted price the closing price in an exchange market bid price the price at which buyer stand ready to purchase and other market information for fixed income security that are not actively traded the pricing service use alternative method to determine fair value for the security including quote for similar fixed income security matrix pricing discounted cash flow using benchmark curve or other factor in certain case when market data is not available we may use broker quote or pricing service that use proprietary pricing model to determine fair value the proprietary model incorporate unobservable input primarily consisting of prepayment curve discount rate default assumption recovery rate yield assumption and credit spread assumption an annual review is performed on the security price received from our pricing service which includes discussion and analysis of the input used by the pricing service to value our security the price of certain security sold close to the quarter end are also compared to the price of the same security at the balance sheet date to ensure the reported fair value is reasonable equity equity security are primarily exchange traded and are valued based on the closing bid official close or last trade pricing on an active exchange if closing price are not available security are valued at the last quoted bid price or may be valued using the last available

rate libor plus an adjustment for non performance risk the adjustment reflects the full credit default swap cd spread applied to net exposure by counterparty considering the master netting agreement and any posted collateral we use our counterparty cd spread when we are in net asset position and our own cd spread when we are in net liability position in case where market data is not available we use broker quote and model black scholes to determine fair value this includes situation where there is lack of liquidity for particular currency or commodity or when the instrument is longer dated

cash flow additional investment or contribution and distribution through year end we may make further adjustment for any known substantive valuation change not reflected in the nav the ford werke gmbh ford werke defined benefit plan is primarily funded through group insurance contract see note we measure the fair value of the insurance asset by projecting expected future cash flow from the contract and discounting them to present value based on current market rate including an assessment for non performance risk of the insurance company the assumption used to project expected future cash flow are based on actuarial estimate and are unobservable therefore the contract is categorized within level of the hierarchy finance receivables we measure finance receivables at fair value using internal valuation model see note these model project future cash flow of financing contract based on scheduled contract payment including principal and interest the projected cash flow are discounted to present value based on assumption regarding credit loss pre payment speed and applicable spread to approximate current rate our assumption regarding pre payment speed and credit loss are based on historical performance the fair value of finance receivables is categorized within level of the hierarchy on nonrecurring basis we also measure at fair value retail contract greater than day past due or deemed to be uncollectible and individual dealer loan probable of foreclosure we use the fair value of collateral adjusted for estimated cost to sell to determine the fair value of our receivables the collateral for retail receivable is the vehicle financed and for dealer loan is real estate or other property the fair value of collateral for retail receivables is calculated by multiplying the outstanding receivable balance by the average recovery value percentage the fair value of collateral for dealer loan is determined by reviewing various appraisal which include total adjusted appraised value of land and improvement alternate use appraised value broker opinion of value and purchase offer debt we measure debt at fair value using quoted price for our own debt with approximately the same remaining maturity see note where quoted price are not available we estimate fair value using discounted cash flow and market based expectation for interest rate credit risk and the contractual term of the debt instrument for certain short term debt with an original maturity date of one year or le we assume that book value is reasonable approximation of the debt fair value the fair value of debt is categorized within level of the hierarchy motor company and subsidiariesnotes to the financial statementsnote summary of significant accounting policy continued employee separation action and

regularly review our model to confirm the continued business significance and statistical predictability of the model and may make update to improve the performance of the model in addition we regularly audit dealer inventory and dealer sale record to verify that the dealer is in possession of the financed vehicle and is promptly paying each receivable following the sale of the financed vehicle the frequency of on site vehicle inventory audit depends primarily on the dealer risk rating under our policy on site vehicle inventory audit of low risk dealer are conducted only circumstance

allowance for credit loss represents our estimate of the probable credit loss inherent in finance receivables of the balance sheet date the adequacy of the allowance for credit loss is assessed quarterly and the assumption and model used in establishing the allowance are evaluated regularly because credit loss may vary substantially over time estimating credit loss requires number of assumption about matter that are uncertain the majority of credit loss are attributable to ford credit consumer receivables portfolio addition to the allowance for credit loss are made by recording charge to ford credit interest operating and other expense on our consolidated income statement the uncollectible portion of finance receivables are charged to the allowance for credit loss at the earlier of when an account is deemed to be uncollectible or when an account is day delinquent taking into consideration the financial condition of the customer borrower or lessee the value of the collateral recourse to guarantor and other factor in the event we repossess the collateral the receivable is charged off and we record the collateral at it estimated fair value le cost to sell and report it in other asset on our consolidated balance sheet charge offs on finance receivables include uncollected amount related to principal interest late fee and other allowable charge recovery on finance receivables previously charged off uncollectible are credited to the allowance for credit loss consumer we estimate the allowance for credit loss on our consumer receivables using combination of measurement model and management judgment the model consider factor such historical trend in credit loss and recovery including key metric such delinquency repossession and bankruptcy the composition of the present portfolio including vehicle brand term risk evaluation and new used vehicle trend in historical used vehicle value and economic condition estimate from these model rely on historical information and may not fully reflect loss inherent in the present portfolio therefore we may adjust the estimate to reflect management judgment regarding observable change in recent economic trend and condition portfolio composition and other relevant factor we make projection of two key assumption to assist in estimating the consumer allowance for credit loss frequency number of finance receivables contract that are expected to default over the loss emergence period lep measured repossession and loss severity expected difference between the amount customer owes when the finance contract is charged off and the amount received net of expense from selling the repossessed vehicle collective allowance for credit loss the collective allowance is evaluated primarily using collective loss to receivables ltr model that based on historical experience indicates credit loss have been incurred in the portfolio even though the particular account that are uncollectible can not be specifically identified the ltr model is based on the most recent year of history an ltr for each product is calculated by dividing credit loss charge offs net of recovery by average net finance receivables excluding unearned interest supplement and allowance for credit loss the average ltr that is calculated for each product is multiplied by the end of period balance for that given product motor company and subsidiariesnotes to the financial statementsnote ford credit allowance for credit loss continued our largest market also use loss projection model to estimate loss inherent in the portfolio the loss projection model applies recent monthly performance metric stratified by contract type retail or lease contract term and risk rating to our active portfolio to estimate the loss that have been incurred the lep is an assumption within our model and represents the average amount of time between when loss event first occurs to when it is charged off this time period start when the consumer begin to experience financial difficulty it is evidenced typically through delinquency before eventually resulting in charge off the lep is multiplier in the calculation of the collective consumer allowance for credit loss for account greater than day past due the uncollectible portion is charged off such that the remaining recorded investment is equal to the estimated fair value of the collateral le cost to sell specific allowance for impaired receivables consumer receivables involved in tdrs are specifically assessed for impairment specific allowance is estimated based on the present value of the expected future cash flow of the receivable discounted at the contract original effective interest rate or the fair value of any collateral adjusted for estimated cost to sell after establishing the collective and specific allowance for credit loss if management belief the allowance doe not reflect all loss inherent in the portfolio due to change in recent economic trend and condition or other relevant factor an adjustment is made based on management judgment non consumer we estimate the allowance for credit loss for non consumer receivables based on historical ltr ratio expected future cash flow and the fair value of collateral collective allowance for credit loss we estimate an allowance for non consumer receivables that are not specifically identified impaired using an ltr model for each financing product based on historical experience this ltr is an average of the most recent historical experience and is calculated consistent with the consumer receivables ltr approach all account that are specifically identified impaired are excluded from the calculation of the non specific or collective allowance specific allowance for impaired receivables dealer financing is evaluated by segmenting individual loan by the risk characteristic of the loan such the amount of the loan the nature of the collateral and the financial status of the debtor the loan are analyzed to determine whether individual loan are impaired and specific allowance is estimated based on the present value of the expected future cash flow of the receivable discounted at the loan original effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral adjusted for estimated cost to sell after establishing the collective and the specific allowance for credit loss if management
