that could affect reported revenue expense asset liability and equity note describes the significant accounting policy used in preparation of the consolidated financial statement the most significant area where management judgment and estimate impact the primary financial statement are described below actual result in these area could differ materially from management estimate under different assumption or condition revenue recognitionthe company evaluates it contract with customer to identify the promised good or service and recognizes revenue for the identified performance obligation at the amount the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those good or service performance obligation is promise in contract to transfer distinct good or service to customer revenue is recognized when or performance obligation are satisfied and control ha transferred to the customer typically when product are shipped or delivered title and risk of loss pas to the customer and the

correspond with it performance under the contract and the transfer of control to the customer valuation of asset and liability acquired in business combinationassets and liability acquired in business combination including intangible asset are accounted for using the acquisition method and recorded at their respective fair value in fiscal the company completed the acquisition of aspen technology inc and engaged an independent third party valuation specialist to assist in the determination of the fair value of intangible asset this included the use of certain assumption and estimate including the projected revenue for the customer relationship and developed technology intangible asset and the obsolescence rate for the developed technology intangible asset although we believe the assumption and estimate to be reasonable and appropriate they require judgement and are based on experience and historical information obtained from aspen technology inc long lived assetslong lived asset which include property plant and equipment goodwill and identifiable intangible asset are reviewed for impairment whenever event or change in business circumstance indicate impairment may exist if the company determines that the carrying value of long lived asset may not be recoverable permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds it estimated fair value reporting unit are also reviewed for possible goodwill impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter if an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not an impairment may exist it is evaluated by comparing the reporting unit estimated fair value to it carrying value fair value is generally estimated using an income approach that discount estimated future cash flow using discount rate judged by management to be commensurate with the applicable risk estimate of future sale operating result cash flow and discount rate are subject to change in the economic environment including such factor the general level of market interest rate expected equity market return and the volatility of market served particularly when recessionary economic circumstance continue for an extended period of time retirement plan the company maintains prudent long term investment strategy consistent with the duration of pension obligation the determination of defined benefit plan expense and liability is dependent on various assumption including the expected annual rate of return on plan asset the discount rate and the rate of annual compensation increase in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle actual result that differ from the company assumption are accumulated deferred actuarial gain or loss and amortized to expense in future

non discount rate would have increased the total projected benefit obligation at september by and increased fiscal pension expense by percentage point decrease in the expected return on plan asset would increase fiscal pension expense by see note contingent liability the company is party to number of pending legal proceeding and claim including those involving general and product liability including asbestos and other matter several of which claim substantial amount of damage the company accrues for such liability when it is probable that future cost including legal fee and expense will be incurred and such cost can be reasonably estimated accrual are based on development to date management estimate of the outcome of these matter and the company experience in contesting litigating and settling similar matter the company engages an outside expert to develop an actuarial estimate of it expected cost to resolve all pending and future asbestos claim including defense cost well it related insurance receivables the reserve for asbestos litigation which is recorded on an undiscounted basis is based on projected claim through although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matter the company historically ha been largely successful in defending against claim and suit that have been brought against it and will continue to defend itself vigorously in all such matter while the company belief material adverse impact is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation remote possibility exists that future development could have material adverse impact on the company see note income taxesincome tax expense and tax asset and liability reflect management assessment of tax paid or expected to be paid received on item included in the financial
